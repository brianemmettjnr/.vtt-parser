##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.449
hey everybody welcome Eckener on the

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.600
line please inviting guys get four plus

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.529
we're doing the regular runs and it has

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.320
never felt better

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.790
we do have boss rush to do on some

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.250
characters you know what let's make it

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.929
easy boss rush blue maybe and then I

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.000
know we got dark room runs to do I'm

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
like basically everybody but we can do a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.630
dark room run or we can do a chest run

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.789
with blue baby I'm not gonna focus

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.350
predominantly on getting boss rush done

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.869
but I think it would be positive for us

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.840
if we if we knock that out now I'm not

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.369
gonna put like a time limit on ourselves

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.250
not for this run in particular of course

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
but also like for the number of non

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.930
challenges we're gonna do we just finish

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.219
like a month of challenges come on just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.690
give me one tenth of rock we just

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.000
finished like a month of challenges and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.180
sometimes I've you know it's easy to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
forget what it is you like about Isaac

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.690
cuz Isaac is all about at least for me

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.219
it's all about that slot machine pull of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.609
like not knowing what you're gonna get

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.010
on a run and then getting something

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.359
great and squandering it or getting

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.589
something terrible and making it work

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.030
and all the other outcomes that

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.030
conceivably fall in between as well

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.960
no promises that this will be on that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.259
spectrum I suppose but I got high hopes

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.479
in dude holy mantle is a pretty great

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.430
pickup I mean it's such a great pickup

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.119
that we could literally just blow this

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.720
TNT up in our own faces running a nope

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.790
concerns and/or consequences as a result

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.829
I'm trying to save hoggle oz for using a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.479
tinted rock but yeah the thing is are

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.490
for using a non its Innsbruck I should

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.930
say among other things but the thing is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.400
like challenges kind of take away that

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.549
slot machine poll because instead of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.110
like dynamically figuring out what your

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.670
problems and strengths are over the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.320
course of a run it just gives you the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
run and goes okay if you figure it out

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.640
and sometimes we do like we got that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.320
Guardian challenge done in the first

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.439
video if not the first attempt which I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.380
was very happy about hug loss is almost

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.570
tempting on that room as well what we

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.850
really want now is an orbital actually

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.020
because holy mantle plus an orbital is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.310
like easy early game at the very least

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.989
but some of the other challenges if I'm

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.390
being honest were ticking me off

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.010
not like to the point that I can't do

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.389
them or like you know won't be

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.980
entertaining or at least attempting to

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.239
be entertaining while I do them but the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.060
only and streak one just rubbed me the

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.409
wrong way like it's late what's that's

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.819
what gets me about the challenges that

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.379
they have their own unique parameters

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.700
which is cool except when they don't

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.290
work the way you'd expect them you know

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.590
check it out I got this sweet run that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.540
totally works it fulfills the trial of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.739
the challenge that I was acquiesced to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.239
do at least we got damage and then all

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.030
of a sudden no it turns out that like

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.340
it's broken maybe again I'm gonna make

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.019
myself look like a fool if it turns out

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.379
that I was the idiot over the course of

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.480
that that challenge but I don't think

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.189
that I was maybe I was the idiot for

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.019
believing but apart from that I don't

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:03.040
believe so

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.169
so really weird weird - tinted rocks or

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.189
sorry - spirit arts one tinted rocker

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.930
more away from getting enough HP to

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.180
conceivably be able to take a deal with

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.739
the devil one and a half would

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.569
technically make it plausible to take

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.000
but I'm if you want to play that

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.709
argument we're actually one HP higher

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.329
than we need to be in order to get a

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.439
deal with the devil as long as we're

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.930
talking about taking deals with the

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.720
devil that would like literally kill us

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.489
that's the case I still I'm holding out

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.560
hope this hog allows renewed it's got us

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.389
right now it's a good run though you

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.280
know getting a damage upgrade and a

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:41.310
pretty good one early on is is nice so

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.389
you're gonna say why don't you do it and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.659
you would be correct we should do it

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.790
here

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.209
I actually I was just peeping that top

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:54.370
left side cuz I thought that there was

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.989
not a way for us to get in there but it

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.299
turns out that there was indeed it just

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.859
it was a little bit segmented so we did

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.900
not get a spirit heart out of that

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.790
though which is a bummer ah there's a

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.139
tinted rock on this room though we got

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.639
two spirit hearts out of that we also

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.430
picked up some consumables on route

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.780
which i think is also very valuable and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.219
we got a trinket which is not that

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.909
valuable but hey you know if we get a

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.469
lot of bombs

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.269
we'll be happy that some of those bombs

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:19.599
can have a little creep associated with

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.909
them he's more valuable than bombs

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.669
presently and Deadeye is another really

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.949
really good upgrade and this is what I

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.630
mean we're creating our own challenge

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.280
I'd rather be at four and a half hearts

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.139
in three and a half hearts and although

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.180
that's true like almost all the time

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.300
it's even more true right now because we

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.800
might be about to to spend the sum so

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.360
it's been a while like in two months

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.510
since we had blank room maybe even more

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.820
unlocked in the game what do we do with

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.070
blank rune like what's the ideal way to

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.350
handle this I think you there's only

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.610
really two ways you deal with it unless

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.110
you're in desperate times you either

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.030
assume it's gonna be per throw or you

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.040
assume it's gonna be era and if it's

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.810
anything else hopefully it just works

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.550
despite using it as if it's one of those

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.750
so we don't like our items we'll

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.220
probably try to use it as if it's per

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.479
throw on our deal with the devil and if

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.889
that doesn't happen maybe we'll go back

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.570
to the shop and try to use it as if it's

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.680
a Yara rune and if it's neither of those

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.120
then you know what well I'll just go

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.419
plunge my toilet I'm trying to come up

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.490
with new expressions dude I'm here to

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:26.560
tell you right now this is probably

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.449
going up late August early September you

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.130
gotta try it even with bad luck right

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.560
now a god big ass also pretty good

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.960
ooh-hoo it's another day guys

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.220
fighter of the night months so many of

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.440
you you know college has recently

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.419
started or maybe for whatever other

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.660
reason you've moved by a plunger I think

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.039
I've gone on this exact rant before you

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.180
might say like oh I've never needed a

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.010
plunger before in my life

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.720
you don't understand a plunger is

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.610
actually like the cheapest form of

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.500
insurance you can buy they're like ten

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.270
dollars they go next to your toilet

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.650
which hopefully you're not storing

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.680
anything valuable there to begin with

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.330
they will save you I have not used the

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.039
plunger probably in like at least three

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.870
years and I don't think there's any

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.669
shame in using a plunger by the way it's

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.020
just as it's as indicative as the

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.610
quality of the quality of the pipe says

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.680
it is the quality of the bowel movement

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.810
however it's one of those things you

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.010
don't want to have to have an accident

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.720
and then go to the store and buy a

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.130
plunger next time you find it I'm not

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.180
saying you should go out you know spend

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.610
your whole Saturday looking for a

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.470
plunger go buy a $10 plunger next time

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.849
you're at a Canadian Tire or you know

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.190
even a supermarket that's big enough

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.950
might have it's one of those things

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.150
every home should have

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.010
feel that way there's like a few

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.110
household appliances you want her

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.430
household tools you want to own before

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.990
you need to own them I'm particularly

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.100
talking to those of you in college right

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.460
now if you don't want to plunge it right

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.340
now

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.660
dude you're gonna be kind to your future

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.390
self you're gonna want it I promise you

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.200
that mostly because you probably and

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.090
don't think it's the wrong way you

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.880
probably live in a pseudo slum if your

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.130
college house is anything like mine and

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.810
then beyond that you're gonna be putting

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.280
some stuff into your body potentially

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.340
that is not gonna make you toilet that

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.630
happy either way one of those things you

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.460
want to have before you need it

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.660
same thing like a fire extinguisher I'm

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.670
guilty of that we don't have a fire

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.120
extinguisher in our apartment we have

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:22.240
sprinklers built into the the ceiling

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.980
but it's probably worthwhile to have a

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.290
fire extinguisher on top of that you

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.940
know in case you have a little fire in

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.230
your apartment you don't want the whole

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.810
building to be alarmed by seems sensible

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.720
to me uh carbon monoxide detector

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.470
probably another big one so you know two

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:46.090
out of three ain't bad

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:48.940
I own a plunger nothing else though it's

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.280
just my little I'm not particularly wise

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.950
you know I'm not a I'm not an old man

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.920
anymore no I'm not I'm not that learn it

00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:00.790
you know I feel like maybe once you hit

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.170
the 40s 50s you become you start to

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.670
amass these tips that you can give the

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.070
people earlier in life that are actually

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.630
useful but as for now here's the life

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.740
experience that I have buy a plunger

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:14.740
trust me there's literally no downside

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.660
nobody has ever gone I'm out of money I

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:21.970
wish I didn't buy that plunger two years

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:23.530
ago I assure you is it worth skipping

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.030
lunch one day to get a plunger now you

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.920
got me question would depends what are

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.530
you getting for lunch like is it

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.940
conceivable that you know that would be

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.040
the most delicious lunch of your life

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.990
versus like the most minute they should

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.610
actually just give you pocket plungers

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.820
that you carry around in your wallet now

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:42.669
there's an idea cuz like you know if you

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.930
clog your own toilet by the way if

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.640
you're going to girls like kid even

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:49.820
listen to this anymore get is real life

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:53.060
baby we're animals okay poops happen

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:56.660
if you're uh if you make an accident

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.490
let's make an axe if you clog your own

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.600
toilet who cares you know use the

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.400
plunger no big deal

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.630
what if you're like on a date and you're

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.530
like I really don't want to have to use

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.940
the bathroom but I got to use the

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.240
bathroom then you clog the toilet that's

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.850
where the pocket plunger comes in you

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.510
unfolded about eight times stick it in

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.580
the toilet

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.660
pump away and then you're good to go

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.220
then you just throw it in the trash

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.030
because it is like a one-time use only

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.850
thing saves you from embarrassing

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:24.830
situations I don't know what it is dude

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.440
if you've ever gone like a video game

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:30.170
convention I've never seen any more

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.140
clogged bathrooms or clogged toilets in

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:35.180
my entire life then I have it video game

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.800
conventions I don't know if there's

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.080
something wrong with the gamer brain

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.760
perhaps my own included that is just

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.250
like I'm gonna clog this thing you can't

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.510
stop me it's like a boss fight

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.950
achievement unlocked or if there's

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:50.870
something wrong with the game or gut

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:53.570
that leads to too many clogs but I mean

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:57.500
the convention life is not not everybody

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.910
treats their body as if it's a temple at

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.880
the epoch conventions there's no

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.020
question about is a lot of walking

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.300
there's a lot of like fried food

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:09.830
consumption possibly a lot of imbibing

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:12.530
of adult beverages but I would think

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.600
that convention toilets are evolves for

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.650
that you know anyway then now we're

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.910
starting to get into like some gross

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:21.650
topics for conversation but it's also

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.390
relevant as we move into pack season

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.540
which is you know we're leaving for next

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.540
week

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.920
it's not really packed season it's

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.830
literally packs but dude this is the

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.960
most hits I've ever taken while having

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.910
holy mantle thankfully holy Mantle's

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.100
protected us from them but I'm getting

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.230
hit like once per room and not on

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.480
purpose like I'm just lucky I guess that

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.610
we got a good item room there that

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.870
worked out in our favor because without

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.000
that we would be in a much worse

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:53.770
position how's the run looking so far

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.570
honestly very very good Deadshot is

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.160
amazingly useful I'm not using the poop

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.410
because like the amount of value of

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.750
brings is very much secondary to the

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.850
amount of annoyance it brings to shoot

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.280
the poop once per room for what you know

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.990
one spirit heart per run one spirit

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.790
heart and six cents per run we've

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.220
already got a sack of pennies so we'll

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.260
just we'll just treat that as if it's

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.820
our six cents per run and then the

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.340
spirit heart hey we got the pacifier

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:23.120
which is also part of the reason that

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:25.450
this runs poppin the deliberate and

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.060
Static tears upgrade thanks to that

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:31.820
stacking with the extra damage due to

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.980
Deadeye here and we're really racking up

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.390
the damage to be able to do ten damage

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.130
on the third floor fourth floor in the

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.290
fourth floor to be able to do ten damage

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.730
on the fourth floor is really strong you

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.020
know I think it we've gone through this

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.960
about twenty times but I'm pretty sure

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:48.070
that Deadshot allows you to at best

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:52.400
double your damage which is a positive

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:53.510
without a doubt you've got 28 cents

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.520
could have gone a little deeper on that

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.800
converters not what we want I'm gonna

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.170
take dull razor just cuz it could be

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:05.020
better for us long term I don't think

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:05.020
dull razor can trigger gimpy but

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:13.259
probably want to look for it regardless

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:16.059
okay the gifts it's basically a random

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:19.089
it's basically a random shop item at

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:26.529
this point so the way that you oh there

00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:27.790
you go the way that you choose this yeah

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:29.769
it's broken so you might as well take it

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:33.819
the way that you choose this is very

00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:36.299
simple you take this watch this it

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:39.189
worked

00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:44.230
ace of clubs not worth using blank card

00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:46.509
for honestly we take this into the

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.309
almost guarantee Thor lays at least like

00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:51.790
a heavily favored deal with the devil

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:54.040
that we're about to get and hopefully

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.480
we'll be able to snag something useful

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.769
there obviously like I'm trying to get

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.809
it all out of the way you know it's like

00:12:56.769 --> 00:13:00.519
we've led a very Puritan lifestyle and

00:12:58.809 --> 00:13:02.439
now you know we're here at spring break

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:04.899
I want it all you know I give me give me

00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:05.949
the body shots give me the jet skiing I

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:07.689
don't know what do people do on spring

00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:10.119
break I'm not much of a beach guy to be

00:13:07.689 --> 00:13:11.739
honest with you don't I don't like my

00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:14.170
skin being exposed to the sunlight just

00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:16.059
something about it is like feels

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.350
unnatural to me it's actually like the

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:21.819
most natural thing in the world it just

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:23.740
feels unnatural to me I don't know blame

00:13:21.819 --> 00:13:25.809
somebody other than me for that I don't

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.490
know who it could conceivably be but I

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:29.110
just want to deflect blame as if there's

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:34.629
any conceivable way that that makes any

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:40.740
sense at all so just keep this up 10.9

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:40.740
damage and max damage bonus very good

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:49.350
and a deal with the devil PJs is not

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:51.569
that strong but it's at least HP why did

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:54.509
it go Gerner as if that was a bad thing

00:13:51.569 --> 00:14:02.370
we just got weight we just got a lump of

00:13:54.509 --> 00:14:03.569
coal from Krampus weight him what what

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.100
if we get a second lump of coal arrived

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:09.089
here does that do anything for us well

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:11.610
we'll never know uh I mean okay the head

00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:13.410
of Krampus is fine but I think blank

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:17.100
card the gauze is a lot better

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:18.750
well no it's not and you're not gonna be

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.579
too pleased with this but here's why

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.980
head of Krampus is better because we're

00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:24.600
gonna use it for boss rush blank card

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.279
something else could have been better

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.009
eventually with a blank card the Gaza is

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:31.079
not worth that that much to us when

00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:32.160
we're keeping in mind that at some point

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:35.279
of this round we're trying to get

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:42.120
through boss rush which can be quite

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:48.149
annoying in its own right yeah we're in

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:49.680
a a pretty darn good spot winning the

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:52.050
run should be no problem beating boss

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.079
rush should be like a modest problem

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:57.000
just a very minor problem blank card

00:14:55.079 --> 00:15:00.709
devil blank card strength probably could

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.910
make a case for a blank card strength

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:07.559
okay being better than Krampus is head

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:09.660
for boss rush specifically but you know

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:12.540
that's it's pretty much water under the

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.100
bridge at this point not a whole heck of

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.920
a lot we can do about it now we do still

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:21.629
have Steam sale and quite a lot of money

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:23.699
so if we can get shops that kind of meet

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:26.790
us halfway we like with a reroll machine

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:33.629
for example I might be able to get a lot

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:37.410
of value out of them thank you so who is

00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:39.120
this this is this is Pam how does pin

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.399
relate to Larry in the lore of the game

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.470
these are questions I've never had but

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:46.110
I'm now feigning having because he's

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.809
like what's the relationship between pin

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.300
the hollow and Larry jr. does Larry jr.

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:52.499
eventually gain the ability to jump and

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.149
then he's the pin and then he gained

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:55.889
the ability to fly and then he's the the

00:15:54.149 --> 00:15:57.539
hollow even though those bosses don't

00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:59.549
necessarily take place later than one

00:15:57.539 --> 00:16:01.739
another and where does scolex factor in

00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:04.129
what about mr. Fred mr. Fred's just kind

00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:09.919
of like a hopped-up scolex isn't he

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:09.919
I'm wide hat I can't take it anymore

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:17.629
shop be good to me okay

00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:24.059
one day I'll figure out what's going on

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:26.279
with the something's wrong pill we can

00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:28.589
donate to our donation machine I totally

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:30.089
forgot so we took trinkets melter I need

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:32.969
your strongest trinkets I'm headed into

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:34.709
battle I'm headed into boss rush you

00:16:32.969 --> 00:16:36.899
can't handle my strongest trinkets

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:39.059
traveler my strongest trinkets would

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:43.469
kill a cobalt streak much less a

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:45.989
Northern Line kinda want to save like I

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:50.129
think ten cents is a fine amount to save

00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:52.289
so we'll just take this to 350 for 30

00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:57.419
minutes or until the skins crispy and

00:16:52.289 --> 00:16:59.369
then very setup for the future here

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:01.859
already been to our item room dude curse

00:16:59.369 --> 00:17:04.159
of the maze was like a blessing for us

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:04.159
here

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:12.850
I could still use more base damage I was

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:16.329
kind of leaning on that last deal with

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:19.980
the devil to work in that direction for

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.980
us and it definitely did not

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.000
but I'd settled for DPS like if we could

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.270
just get damaged that would be that'd be

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.060
worth a lot if we could get the ability

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.950
to summon spiders via infestation to its

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.450
rarer than getting a full guppy

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.280
transformation but I feel bad always

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.670
asking for the guppy transformation in

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:47.430
its entirety so you know trying to be

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:51.410
trying to mix things up a little bit at

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.410
least in appearance if not in actuality

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.350
alright so you're gonna go down pretty

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.910
easily this is the time this is the time

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.760
for us to beat the odds because we do

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:08.310
want to at least it's a tears upgrade

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.290
but we do want to actually 5 rate of

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.370
fire is really strong but we want to

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.260
make sure that we can actually get the

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.270
boss rush so we're kind of I wouldn't

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.790
say under the gun I wouldn't say under

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.490
my thumb my 18 favorite Rolling Stones

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.590
song you want to list them in order well

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:26.100
what's the best Rolling Stones Rolling

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.990
Stones song I know you only can't get no

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.770
satisfaction I'm blah blah blah blah I'm

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:33.480
not like I'm not insulting satisfactions

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.070
- great song or you can't always get

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.440
what you want you know sympathy for the

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.970
devil these are great tracks no question

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.080
on that as long as you're not saying

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:44.580
like oh you know dole step baby don't

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.980
stay I mean you're entitled like

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.530
whatever you like is the other aspect it

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.850
I haven't touched upon let's go do the

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.680
boss fight even though this floor is

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:55.080
rich we do want to knock this out I

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.430
don't know what we get sometimes I get

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.710
painted is the guy who rushes through

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:02.270
things like stop and smell the roses yo

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:08.130
but we get some cooler smelling roses if

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:10.500
we if we knock out this optional

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.630
achievement here but anyway I'm very

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.450
very partial I'm not a big Rolling

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.940
Stones guy but Exile on Main Street from

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.160
1972 one of the best albums ever made

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.600
bar none we can't even take advantage of

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.720
Judas a shadow but I'm happy to have it

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.130
just in case we can't wilfully take

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.720
advantage of it because we don't need

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.720
the Judas drops but

00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:36.299
you know tumbling dice love and cup

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.129
there's some all-time classics on the

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:40.739
album never get played on the radio

00:19:38.129 --> 00:19:44.909
despite its really is not a singles

00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:48.239
record that's like a that's an album

00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:50.279
album so we do not need the gods we have

00:19:48.239 --> 00:19:54.179
any curse right now that would even like

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:55.080
benefit us to use to Gus I don't think

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:56.909
so

00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.840
we have several year as an analogous

00:19:56.909 --> 00:20:04.649
let's keep the yeras as you might expect

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:07.080
I think that will probably end up using

00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:11.009
those on the chest for now good chance

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:14.729
of a deal with the devil we got it and a

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:19.559
fame is pretty good and then we got boss

00:20:14.729 --> 00:20:24.029
rush and boss rush has nothing I'm very

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:28.559
interested in so I think I'm actually

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:30.119
gonna go for friendzone takes us a

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:32.279
little closer to Beelzebub

00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:34.649
I mean I'm grasping at straws here but

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:36.690
I'm grasping at straws because none of

00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:38.879
them were that good d20 is probably best

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.639
but I didn't want to ruin our chances of

00:20:38.879 --> 00:20:44.749
getting you know some extra damage done

00:20:41.639 --> 00:20:44.749
due to cram business head here

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.380
so we have an extra like little bit of

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:59.540
damage as a result of this plus the

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:03.980
chance for Beelzebub plus we get to keep

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.910
Krampus is head which hopefully you know

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.809
won't let me down here

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:15.360
another great Rolling Stone song don't

00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:17.610
let me do let's see the joke is there

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.260
that songs by the Beatles not by see I

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.940
was gonna get them confused I made a

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.450
joke ages ago they're probably two years

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.890
ago how like you know you can't always

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.890
get what you want is the best Justin

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:31.679
Bieber song people play too right into

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.240
my hand dude I remember it I was like

00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:34.530
nobody's gonna fall for this nobody's

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.940
gonna think I actually think you can't

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:38.340
always get what you want is by Justin

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.630
Bieber some people thought I thought you

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:45.169
can't always get what you want is my

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:47.730
Justin Bieber just remember I am always

00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:49.770
0.01 steps ahead of very small

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:53.610
percentage of you I'm certainly not one

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:55.110
step ahead of all of you but I'm 0.01

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:57.980
steps ahead of some of you and I think

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.980
that's doubtless

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.560
why you know it's because of the onand

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.440
streak on the last episode where I was

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.970
like should be walking into enemies on

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.440
the regular we should not be walking

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.750
into enemies in the red that was an

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.910
accident we should be walking on the Sun

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:20.880
cuz it ain't no joke I'd like to buy the

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:24.410
world a coke and see the it's no joke

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:27.930
I'd like to buy the world a coke

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:29.730
doot-doot-doot I don't remember almost

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:35.010
anything of walking on the Sun by

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:38.910
smashmouth just let that units of

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:41.130
passion and the sku Buddha do I really

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.740
remember like none of that song I mean

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.330
it's probably been like at least eight

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.640
or nine years since I heard walking on

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.830
the Sun by Smash Mouth but definitely

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.830
like the chorus is locked away in the

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:55.680
memory banks so don't delay act now

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.970
supplies are running out but not if

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.150
you're still alive

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:03.360
six to eight years to but if you follow

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:05.910
there may be a tomorrow but if the

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:10.370
offense done you might as well be

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:13.470
walking on the square now down a map BAM

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:16.110
but the verses are lost forever despite

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:18.300
that being the lead single on the only

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:25.560
Smash Mouth album I actually own as a

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:27.090
child you know what it's a tragedy that

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.610
I'll have to wait for a later day for

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:33.090
now focus on boss rush cuz you're kind

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:35.190
of not in trouble yet at least but

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:38.250
you're in like you could get in trouble

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:41.160
soon it's like you know you wouldn't put

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.080
us on TLC and send us to jail as a 12

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.560
year old and be like hey scared my kid

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:49.770
into you know following the rule of law

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:52.440
but you might be like if you don't get

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:56.090
your stuff together soon I'm gonna we're

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.090
gonna approach that as a possibility

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:08.270
this will be done any lifetime now okay

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:10.740
I was walked right into the red pooop'

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:15.450
cut me some slack on this one my skills

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:20.280
are a little rusty like Chevy Chase's

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:24.120
firstborn son in the vacation films no

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:29.700
special bombs huh threw away a lot of HP

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:33.060
we had no reason to throw away here take

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:35.250
the inevitable end of basra sheer as as

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:39.000
an opportunity to you know smash that

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:40.980
reset button gate get yourself back up

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.720
to an eco equilibrium you feel confident

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:47.910
with blue baby's only friend I love that

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.170
item blue baby's only friend is like a

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.590
ten out of ten item

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:55.350
well people hate watching it but apart

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:57.000
from that I really like it now if we

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.310
play our cards right and that's I think

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.340
a big if in this situation but play our

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:08.580
cards right we could get better safe

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:11.400
than sorry man we could get a hush fight

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:16.440
here but we need some spirit arts to

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:19.950
come out of the woodwork first we all

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:22.680
it's like a little embarrassing but we

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:24.030
have no reason or excuse to die

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:28.650
we have holy mantle we have

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:30.540
invincibility on the regular rust or no

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.860
rust it's time to prove the game screwed

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.380
you on those challenges and you didn't

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.660
just you know screw yourself

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.520
tears down is bad but I mean going from

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.200
six to five it's not that bad

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.420
it's like going from like number one in

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:46.160
the world at number three on the Forbes

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.160
richest list you know

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.540
I remain unconcerned

00:25:58.929 --> 00:26:03.679
don't really want to fight all these

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.289
rooms but you know it's a good

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:08.269
opportunity to reforge ourselves in the

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:15.649
crucible of relative difficulty right

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:18.019
now it's better that the run was not

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:22.359
handed to us on a silver platter now it

00:26:18.019 --> 00:26:22.359
might be better even better than that

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:30.889
let's go if we were able to pick up like

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:32.570
a single damaged upgrade from the second

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:34.580
floor until now but but you know I'm

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.769
just happy to you walked into the red

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.840
pooop' I'm just happy to be here for now

00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:41.179
and I mean that sincerely I'm happy to

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:44.899
be on a normal run and that probably

00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:46.429
marks the ability or the the it marks

00:26:44.899 --> 00:26:48.049
the signpost I should say of us being

00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:51.799
more than halfway through the challenges

00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:53.330
because we've only got ten left for the

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:55.159
first time and then the ones that we

00:26:53.330 --> 00:27:00.559
lost the first time which can't be more

00:26:55.159 --> 00:27:01.129
than like another ten speed is gonna be

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:03.409
annoying

00:27:01.129 --> 00:27:07.029
I don't think own on streak is that bad

00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:07.029
it's like speed is the worst

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:13.970
if I could do it over again I'd break

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:15.960
them up a little bit more because you

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.570
know I really think that the Nestle

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.600
corporation had it on lock with the the

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:24.149
song give me a break give me a break

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:29.940
give me a break from the slightly broken

00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:34.950
challenges now won't be for me to say we

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:37.080
need it but I would love to see nine

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.989
lives even as blue baby

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.769
now beyond nine lives I'd really love to

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:49.409
see can you keep a secret really love to

00:27:43.769 --> 00:27:51.869
see the virus because the virus combined

00:27:49.409 --> 00:27:53.940
with invincibility lets us walk into

00:27:51.869 --> 00:27:55.320
enemies will generate spirit hearts

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.119
Bob's your uncle that's no fair

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.519
everybody's got an uncle Bob you got to

00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:01.940
be more specific than that Bob sack

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:01.940
amano

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:13.700
it is spirit hearts from the virus right

00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:16.700
like non demon hearts not demon arts I

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.700
believe

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:29.620
we got time I was gonna save the Empress

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.870
for the boss but High Priestess is also

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:34.660
fine it's only scarred womb one our

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:36.820
dream or perhaps nightmare of a hush

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.060
fight is not coming true here we've gone

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:42.870
through a lot of rooms on this floor too

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:45.760
like we should be knocking on the boss

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.230
door any second now you know what be a

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.070
nice way to pay me back just deal with

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:54.930
the devil of nine lives and the virus

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:57.730
well we're talking no that's

00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:04.450
implausible I don't even know you can't

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:07.620
even get the virus from from boss are

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:09.970
from deals with the devil I think I I

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.650
don't know at this point I've had chaos

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:16.050
so many times like my brain is no

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:16.050
concept of what item is in whatever pool

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:22.900
so unfortunately it's not really a great

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.870
room to use High Priest it's not I'm

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:28.120
gonna do it anyway because we want to

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.610
take the arrow with us but kind of open

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.340
for a boss we could one tab we did get a

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:35.380
tears upgrade it's only one but it's

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.150
still pretty good and then ceremonial

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.390
robes is basically like you'd have to

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:43.630
come up with a pretty convenient reason

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:46.030
not to take it it's HP a better kind of

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.380
HP and damage in the process but it's

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.000
not specifically what we were looking

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.890
for unfortunately think I'm gonna just

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.890
let the the dream die

00:29:55.230 --> 00:30:00.450
I don't think that it's prudent for us

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:04.620
to worry too much about making it to the

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:06.330
hush fight we have not done it so we we

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.490
still have to do that as blue baby but

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:13.530
for now it's not the right time

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:14.610
it's that would be a mistake but we

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:18.210
should be able to hold this one together

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:19.980
for a fairly easy chest victory the

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:26.360
obvious problem with this run right now

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:26.360
is that we're a little light on HP but

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:34.070
barring complete disaster holy mantle is

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:39.450
gonna buy us a lot of time presumably I

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:45.450
guess we should never use yeah we should

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:47.250
never use Book of Shadows until we've

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:51.570
lost our holy mantle charge for that

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:56.820
room bad start

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:58.049
I got hit twice in rapid succession well

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.640
it just goes to show you you know the

00:30:58.049 --> 00:31:04.370
best laid plans of mice and men and all

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:09.020
that you got a check it's worth a look

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:09.020
it's like extremely worth a look

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.830
it's a lot of stuff interview

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.269
try not to get too accustomed to seven

00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:29.129
damage it's a little unfair to expect

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:32.399
the game to meet you in the middle there

00:31:29.129 --> 00:31:34.409
well I don't know I say don't get used

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:35.759
to seven damage by today I'm running

00:31:34.409 --> 00:31:36.989
them through what I just said in my head

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:42.869
and I'm saying it's ridiculous

00:31:36.989 --> 00:31:45.149
I meant seventeen if I said seven seven

00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:46.889
damage we should expect I think we're at

00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:50.330
like six points something with no

00:31:46.889 --> 00:32:03.330
bonuses right now that's not that good

00:31:50.330 --> 00:32:11.729
seventeen is overkill but just be smart

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:13.289
here yet another dead ends I'm worried

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:15.149
about complaining though because I

00:32:13.289 --> 00:32:17.460
complained a lot on my guardian run

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:22.049
complain a lot on the onand streak run

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:25.259
at some point I really do I believe in

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:27.059
the statement that they think it at

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:29.159
least holds some truth people say if you

00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:30.779
meet a jerk every once in a while the

00:32:29.159 --> 00:32:34.289
person's a jerk if you meet a jerk every

00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:36.419
day maybe you're the jerk if you're

00:32:34.289 --> 00:32:38.279
complaining about every about the

00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:40.559
occasional run people take you seriously

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:42.570
you complain about every run you know

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:45.570
you're just the complainer gives you a

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:47.429
reputation I don't like to complain

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.259
about video games for the most part some

00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:52.469
night on the LSS you know we play it up

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:55.379
for humour some sometimes but I'm very

00:32:52.469 --> 00:32:58.999
much not like a you know the developers

00:32:55.379 --> 00:33:03.299
don't care and blah blah blah etc etc

00:32:58.999 --> 00:33:05.729
I'm not that dude so I like to think

00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:08.219
that when I complain comes from a place

00:33:05.729 --> 00:33:09.779
of a little it's taking I wasn't say

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:12.359
more seriously but it's taken more

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:14.940
honestly like I I'm not drumming up like

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:16.349
a fake complaint especially about Isaac

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.989
you know as community's gone through his

00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:23.210
ups and downs and I've kind of always

00:33:18.989 --> 00:33:25.580
been relatively positive

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:27.529
I do that because first off it's the

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.539
honest like truth about how I feel but

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:30.799
secondly it also means that when you

00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:32.330
have something to complain about if you

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:34.159
choose your battles more appropriately

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:36.500
people take it more seriously if you're

00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:38.240
always complaining about everything when

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.120
something serious comes around people

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.200
are like you know they tune you out cuz

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.549
they they're like because this is

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.169
actually something serious or is this

00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:53.240
just him going on you know another rant

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:57.500
or something like that that being said I

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:59.539
am the guy who always appears to run

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.590
into people breaking the social mores at

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:04.340
the grocery store

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:05.179
so by that analogy am I the jerk yeah I

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.799
think so

00:34:05.179 --> 00:34:08.089
these people are just buying deli meats

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:12.290
and I'm over here going you can't buy

00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:14.149
deli meats like that you can only buy

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:17.800
this many deli meats that's part of it

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:17.800
the joke to begin with

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:32.180
yeah we're not going that way not going

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:36.800
that way tell me when he ain't nothing

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:39.080
for us down there tell me why that final

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:43.070
boss fights not fair

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:54.020
tell me why I never wanna go to the

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:56.030
voices blue baby not going that way that

00:34:54.020 --> 00:35:04.280
was to the tune of the Backstreet Boys I

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:06.950
want it that way one of the great

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.660
mysteries it's like when they say I

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.280
never want to hear you say I want it

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.560
that way what does that mean it's like

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.420
when meatloaf says I would do anything

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.070
for love but I won't do that or you know

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:22.460
what does scarlet johansson say at the

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:24.680
end of lost in translation you know girl

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.600
that's I'm not gonna merge the good name

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.280
of the Jesus and Mary Chain psycho candy

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:33.680
almost as good as Exile on Main Street

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:35.450
not quite different sorta you know media

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:40.850
property there that's right I get down

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:43.640
with the shoegaze is that that's like

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:47.660
post it's not post rock what is it

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:53.590
post-punk Jesus and Mary Chain shoegaze

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:57.160
or post-punk Jesus and Mary Chain

00:35:53.590 --> 00:36:00.650
Scottish alternative rock band

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:02.660
alternative rock band oh here you go

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:05.360
genres alternative rock noise pop

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:08.450
post-punk shoegazing indie pop in Iraq

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.670
yeah that's when I think of the Jesus

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:14.300
and Mary Chain it's like it's them Belle

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:16.390
and Sebastian and lost campesinos rate

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:23.270
of the the pinnacle of indie pop them

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:26.720
just like honey just great dude why are

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:28.700
you watching this gold listen to psycho

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.110
candy by the Jesus and Mary Chain

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.110
it's an all-time classic

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:48.079
Isak you do not have my permission to

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:49.460
hit me it's actually like an easier

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:50.630
fight than most of the rooms which

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.730
doesn't normally happen

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:56.630
the reasoning is like emerging gameplay

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:58.339
we are fighting a nearly stationary

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.859
target and we have an item that gives us

00:36:58.339 --> 00:37:03.380
a huge damage bonus when we lay in

00:37:00.859 --> 00:37:05.329
successive shots so really like we've

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.339
almost got like a built-in devil card

00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:10.369
for this boss fight no I'm not going

00:37:07.339 --> 00:37:13.930
that way not going that way do you know

00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:13.930
remember the song we sang it earlier

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:31.220
sorry arrow room pops no yes yeah yeah

00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:33.020
yeah man yeah okay tough loves okay Book

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.790
of Revelations is a spirit heart

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.309
possibly more but I think I'd rather

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:39.950
stick with Book of Shadows just for fun

00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:41.720
we get Capricorn which is great although

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.390
we already have the damage multiplier so

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:47.510
not as great is not what I hoped I guess

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:49.880
PhD gave us a 48 hour energy pill pretty

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.660
good undefined largely irrelevant and

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.940
we'll just stick with Book of Shadows

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.309
over sprinkler cuz ours our tier

00:37:52.940 --> 00:38:02.210
synergies are like not anything to write

00:37:55.309 --> 00:38:04.010
home about okay

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:08.510
now we're cooking with gas cuz Holy

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:12.339
Light is amazing and we're firing very

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:14.510
quickly so we already had the benefit of

00:38:12.339 --> 00:38:16.280
you know getting more damage the more

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:18.319
shots you put in but now to like have

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.660
the chance to land a holy light shot not

00:38:18.319 --> 00:38:23.690
to mention our HP like we're in a a very

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.920
very very very very good spot I'm not

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.270
even gonna go back for the battery

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.579
charges cuz as of right now it's

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:30.319
meaningless we're just a straight-up

00:38:28.579 --> 00:38:32.359
we're not gonna get a hit six times on

00:38:30.319 --> 00:38:37.010
one room and if we can hit four times on

00:38:32.359 --> 00:38:38.930
one room we'll go back but getting it

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:41.599
six times on one room would represent me

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:43.339
dying at this chair so if that happens

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:45.049
you'll forgive me but I got bigger fish

00:38:43.339 --> 00:38:47.270
to fry like finding an insurance

00:38:45.049 --> 00:38:49.369
provider that'll hook me up with this

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:54.910
dope life insurance plan like four

00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:54.910
minutes before death probably unlikely

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:01.130
growl growl growl growl now

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:12.769
just keep it up here you're doing good

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:15.349
work and this is gonna be a win you just

00:39:12.769 --> 00:39:18.470
get a sense for it you know when you

00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:19.999
have 14 damage a fire rate that's above

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.470
the camp one of the best familiars in

00:39:19.999 --> 00:39:23.299
the game one of the best tear effects in

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.769
the game and a decent amount of HP plus

00:39:23.299 --> 00:39:26.359
the ability to respawn a deal double

00:39:24.769 --> 00:39:27.799
damage but we're gonna knock out some

00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:29.989
stuff it's blue baby this time which is

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:31.970
also valuable we already got blue baby's

00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:33.349
only friend which I love is an item and

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:37.730
even if you don't love it

00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:40.220
it saves some archetypes of runs like a

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:42.079
bad lost run can become a pretty good

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:46.670
lost run with blue baby's only friend a

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:49.549
bad keeper run same deal you know it

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.839
really like a bad any character run but

00:39:49.549 --> 00:39:55.509
the less HP you have the more it

00:39:50.839 --> 00:39:55.509
probably matters is what I'm getting at

00:39:58.239 --> 00:40:02.869
not really surprised at the lack of

00:40:00.319 --> 00:40:05.740
items here I mean we have zero Lux so it

00:40:02.869 --> 00:40:08.900
seems relatively sensible

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.900
[Music]

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:15.460
appropriate might be the word not often

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:15.460
used to describe by content but

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.560
stay of like back get back you don't

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.930
know me like that all we need to do is

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.850
Coast this one through a I feel like

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:30.410
we've been blessed or cursed with longer

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.730
than usual floors that was our chance at

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.320
the virus but you know what it's

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.510
important for our character development

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:39.050
that we didn't need the virus there even

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:42.800
though we all that was bad even though

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:46.960
we asked for it earlier it's important

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:48.980
for us as an arc that we no longer

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.570
founder the necessity

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.070
whereas previously it would have been a

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.630
saving grace I mean we were down to one

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:58.310
and a half spirit arts for a while there

00:40:53.630 --> 00:41:01.190
so we're much more well-equipped now as

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:03.770
a result and now due to the irony and of

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:05.330
course I have no consequences are saying

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:08.240
this I could just be lying to you fate

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:10.100
is also a great item but I would

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.630
probably have tried to go to the void if

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.700
they'd given us the portal there but for

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.660
now that's for another day thanks for

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.560
