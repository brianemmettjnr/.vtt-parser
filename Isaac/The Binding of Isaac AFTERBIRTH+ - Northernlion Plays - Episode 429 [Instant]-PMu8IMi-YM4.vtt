##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.360
everybody welcome at dinner the land

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.799
plays a binding of issac after birth

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.259
plus we're not doing that say file that

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.639
save files for the birds dude we were

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.559
doing this save file where we did

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.620
nothing on the last episode despite

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.260
having a really good run I'm like what

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.460
is that far right side I'm confused but

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.150
you know what we don't have it as

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.010
anybody

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.840
we beat delirium shouldn't that count

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
for something and the hush is like the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.810
the blue rocked out of the bottom right

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.410
anyway whatever um we we have done

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.440
apollyon

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.050
pretty recently we're kind of due for a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.420
greed mode run let's do a little Maggie

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
greed mode nobody gets out of bed for a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.680
Maggie greed Mud Run nobody goes old

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.940
fantastic it's Maggie greed mode but

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:54.770
it's got to be done and you know just

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:58.079
focus on the fact that holy crab my wife

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:03.149
scared the bejesus out of me

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.710
when she came in here oh yeah how about

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.100
this one nobody knocks on the door

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.159
before they come in there we go see that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.930
some now I'm okay with that yeah all

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.659
right now I appreciate it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.799
less of a heart attack more of a sign of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.310
support oh all right well our first item

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.780
was an old bandage nobody's excited

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.270
about old bandage works every time

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.890
all right hit me I wanted you to hit me

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.340
so I could drop a red heart you've

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.810
played right into my hand we're kind of

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.369
it stinks a little bit to have to buy a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.130
key on the first floor but you got to do

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.720
what you got to do it's greed and let's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.490
just take that as like the tax that we

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.470
have to pay for getting a guaranteed

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.820
deal with the devil see right now oh we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.560
got nothing to worry about

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.320
actually Maggie I don't know why I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.350
accidentally had like an accent from

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.290
Eastern Europe there actually Maggie in

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.820
greed mode is pretty okay because young

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.380
heart is actually just much better in

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.600
greed mode than it is in the other modes

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.179
get to use it a lot more frequently for

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.080
a lot less cost especially if you can

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.060
get to the point where you're crushing

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.440
enemies pretty quickly so I do tend to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.010
take damage in greed mode I play a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.390
little

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.890
a little bit of a sloppy or game a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.810
little bit fast and loose you know I

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.000
stopped being the 2016 New England

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.130
Patriots start being the 2004 Kansas

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.080
City Chiefs I run an offense focus game

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.340
it's a West Coast offense I don't know

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.470
what that means but I do live in

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.830
Vancouver so is you know befitting that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.870
one way or the other um we're going to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.030
get enough money so I'm gonna buy a torn

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.390
photo before I buy a key because I think

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.900
that a 30% increase in rate of fire is

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.640
is very prudent and you know what I'm

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.770
actually gonna take an extra step and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.310
I'm gonna step on that like a literal

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.250
extra step I'm gonna step on that that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.470
way we're gonna get please just pop up

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.030
for a second like if you pop up I can

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.850
tear you apart there we go this way

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.800
we're going to get our key we can get

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.680
our item room item before we fight the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.420
boss we already have 5 HP so it doesn't

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.750
really matter in my mind whether or not

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.120
we I mean it's kind of garbage huh yeah

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.050
doesn't really matter to me in my

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.580
opinion whether or not we're able to you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.440
know make sure that we don't lose a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.150
little bit more HP before our deal with

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.709
the devil probably not too important and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.330
I'm gonna take Necronomicon over yum

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.220
hard and that's a bit of a contentious

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.380
choice cuz yah Mart is I just said it's

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.690
pretty good but Necronomicon for

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.780
everything but bosses has the potential

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.370
to like pseudo steamroll these waves

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.110
like imagine you stack up like three

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.760
waves and then just use Necronomicon to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.080
clear them all or at least the debt

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.970
reduce that you were unable to clear in

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.670
advance I will say if we could

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.650
is there any item on the deal with the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.630
devil that would give us bombs right off

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.370
the bat because two bombs here could be

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.840
pretty precious we get a lot of money

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.330
for them and there's also a tinted rock

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.040
we could take advantage of i thought

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.790
maybe these would be Larry juniors and I

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.380
was excited to basically kill Larry jr.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.450
the one tap of the spacebar but you know

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.430
instead we'll save our Necronomicon I

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.400
actually don't think we have a terrible

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.049
build here and our runs not half bad

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.459
either no but I don't think we have a

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.470
terrible build here for fighting mega

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.720
fatty like obviously our damage is trash

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.950
but where our fire rate is such that

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.510
we'll take them out in a reasonable

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.990
amount of time I'm just kidding it's

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.169
kind of

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.250
an unreasonable amount of time but we

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.110
don't really have much choice in the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.759
matter and you know above all else it's

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.349
not like Necronomicon is gonna save us

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.590
in terms of our our overall time

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:45.569
investment here there have to be like

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.150
it's in one line of code okay if dps is

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.970
under a value that you set yourself as

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.889
constant that's for the developers then

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.930
mega fatty cannot show up on your first

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.610
floor of greed mode or champion Ragman

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.970
can't show up that's all I ask just

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.419
because it's it's bordering on tedium

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.069
here you know important bordering on

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.870
tedium sounds like a great title for a

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.729
movie but not a great thing to happen to

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.199
a video game especially early on here

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.000
like I'm trying to improve my watch time

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.919
on YouTube so I can get some more of

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.199
that fat YouTube read revenue and then

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.849
here we are you're giving me garbage and

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.380
telling me it's it's not garbage it's

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.759
recycling and I'm saying well then put

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.620
it in the proper container and you're

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.270
going a little which ones would I go out

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.330
you know what I can sympathize it's a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.009
little confusing these days that's why

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.229
we need Seinfeld to come back you ever

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.610
like get a drink from a coffee shop and

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.590
then they got three different recycling

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.289
bins one for compost one for trash one

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.690
for everything else and then you you go

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.490
I mean I don't know does every part of

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.919
this go in the recycling does what does

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.389
the top go in the garbage and some of it

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.710
goes in the compost I don't know they

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.370
should have like a lesson when you buy

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.139
the good in the first place you might

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.389
say Oh NL it's not that confusing I

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.740
think it is I think if you don't think

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.310
it's that confusing you're probably not

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.190
doing it right

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.259
you're not thinking hard enough anyway

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:06.199
we got a key this runs not amazing but

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:10.770
now it is so epic AK is borderline

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:13.139
game-winning all by its lonesome we're

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.680
now missing too much more to make this

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:20.219
run like a functional victory here is a

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.490
weird situation cuz like raw liver is a

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:26.219
great item but I don't really know if we

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.039
need it I might actually prefer to get

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:31.289
starter deck of all things but let's

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.569
let's just start here and you know keep

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:36.949
in mind I do have Necronomicon we would

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.949
all love you know I'm

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.540
the stereotype that men can never admit

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.100
their mistakes okay

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.080
I don't agree with this stereotype at

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.390
least not for me personally maybe maybe

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.760
back in the olden days you know like the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.410
the heralded days of the 1980s a man's

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.120
afraid to stop and ask for directions or

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.590
something on the side of the road now I

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.790
would be afraid to stop and ask for

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.170
directions at the side of the road

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.430
because I would expect the person that

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.200
I'm asking to be like why don't you just

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.730
play your phone and look at Google like

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.820
it says more about me than it does about

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:06.790
the other guy I think anyway I'm never

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.290
afraid or at least I like to think that

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.940
I'm rarely afraid to admit my own

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.740
mistakes to take responsibility

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.750
Necronomicon was a mistake there was

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.360
pretty much no reason to have it after

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.050
this point but we didn't know that epic

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.730
act was coming at least I didn't if you

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.290
did you could have told me but instead

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.790
you're holding the information to

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.570
yourself I don't know what do you think

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.770
that makes you better than me or

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.590
something like that well guess what

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.950
you're right love yourself okay we're

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:38.800
gonna try to find a secret room with

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:40.990
epic AK okay we got a trinket and it's

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.030
not a bad one I want enough money to get

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.490
raw liver but it's not necessarily like

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:51.130
of the most pivotal importance it might

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:53.110
actually be good it spin again still

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.980
like ten times easier than the mega

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:59.410
fatty fight but we might just want to

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.430
turn all or almost all of this money

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:06.490
into bombs and we can stand to gain as a

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.770
result of that I think is there an

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:13.510
actual boss here just three slot because

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:15.370
three sloth is like not that bad dude so

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.000
I watched Alien Resurrection last night

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:21.610
okay I am first off let's fight these

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.210
guys while we talk I'm a fan of the

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:28.540
Alien franchise alien of course classic

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:30.340
haunting movie that that strikes the

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.680
rare balance between like wow that's

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.300
like incredibly amazing like it fills

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.849
you with a sense of human wonder and

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.349
then also terrifies you it goes like hey

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:40.360
what if you know there was

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:43.000
extraterrestrial life and also what if

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.800
that extraterrestrial life impregnated

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.250
your diaphragm and then caused something

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.810
to shoot out of it you know aliens top

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.500
tier action movie one

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:55.930
the best action movies of all time alien

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.890
3 I have not seen I'm being 100% real

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.090
with you at least is the best of my

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.330
memory I have not seen it

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:03.160
I watched Alien Resurrection I think it

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.930
might straight-up be one of the worst

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.700
movie we're taking chaos over Rob liver

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.050
might straight-up be one of the worst

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.060
movies I've ever seen in my life

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.490
you're gonna maybe be like NL haven't

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:16.180
you you've seen Prometheus right I've

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:19.300
seen Prometheus Prometheus is 20 times

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.010
better than Alien Resurrection and I

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.839
hate Prometheus I know you'll the

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.060
scientist who's naive doesn't act like a

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:29.140
real scientist that is Alien

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:31.330
Resurrection but it's also shot ugly you

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.670
know in Alien Resurrection everything

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.170
looks like garbage in prometheus at

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.029
least it looks good and then it tricks

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.170
you into I'm not gonna rally against

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:39.940
Prometheus if you like the movie you

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.760
like the movie we've been over this many

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.560
times but I want to talk about one scene

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.390
in particular if you're not familiar

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.750
with the plot of the alien films don't

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:54.100
worry about it too much Ellen Ripley was

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:55.630
like an astronaut scientist of some sort

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.000
anyway she goes into space and they like

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.580
meet these aliens and they're like hey

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.450
aliens are you nice and aliens are not

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:06.220
nice they are mean aliens let me buy the

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.710
7 cent item first here because then we

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.780
get more 7 cent items alright alright

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.430
alright alright I can live with this we

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.650
certainly do not need Bob's rotten head

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.810
I almost took it cuz Necronomicon is not

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.600
worth much but Bob's rotten head we

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.130
literally have already rose long time no

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.970
see I almost forgot what that item did

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:26.170
um so then like in one of the movies

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.030
somewhere down the line she gives like

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.380
an alien inside of her I think it might

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.120
be in the first alien like she puts

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.560
herself in the cryopod and goes like

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.490
maybe you'll be able to fix this one day

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.640
and she just kind of floats through

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.320
space then it aliens Paul Reiser works

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.600
at this evil corporation called

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.060
weyland-yutani who's like hey we really

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.610
like you we want you to go like you know

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.810
not be subject to the aliens anymore

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.279
then they put her on a ship and they

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.480
subject her to aliens and they're trying

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:51.040
to do all these experiments to build

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.130
like a genetic weapon and so anyway you

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.550
get the idea in Alien for Ellen Ripley

00:10:54.130 --> 00:11:00.370
is she's been dead for like a long time

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:03.070
I guess she dies in alien 3 but she's

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.310
been like cloned by the military because

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.990
they

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.090
want to consider despite all the

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:10.450
warnings you know mankind just never

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.710
learns so they want to make the aliens

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.240
in a like a superweapon and they're

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.790
doing all sorts of weird experiments so

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.310
at one point a clone of Ellen Ripley who

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:21.279
is our protagonist is walking around she

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:23.500
finds like these pods and all these pods

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:26.370
have like weird botched clones of like

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:30.880
like genetic mashups of her in the alien

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:32.230
the xenomorph if you will and she's

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.850
she's going through them and you could

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.470
tell us going through her head cuz it's

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.940
obvious she's like first thought this is

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.860
gross secondly like does your

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.500
weyland-yutani does your greed know it

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.980
know no bounds and then she meets a sub

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.960
half Sigourney Weaver half alien clone

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.490
that's still alive but it's like gasping

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.130
for air it's a pathetic sight you know

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:55.839
it's going and then it Ripley comes over

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:57.130
to her and she goes kill me and you're

00:11:55.839 --> 00:12:00.520
like wow that's like a pretty tragic

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:03.190
moment does our protagonist put her out

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.260
of her misery yes but not before

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.339
inflicting some misery on her own I want

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.220
to point out that at this point in the

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:11.800
movie Ellen Ripley is she's rolling with

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:16.420
a team of mercenaries they got pistols

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:20.110
shotguns grenades laser rifles every

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:22.690
every piece of weaponry that exists and

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:25.780
also near future technology as imagined

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.670
in the year 1997 so what did she do

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.490
popper one in the head take her out of

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:33.100
her misery nah Ellen Ripley enterprising

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.110
hero bastion of empathy oh but she

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.060
wasn't actually empathetic at that point

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.620
she was you know still under the

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.390
influence of the Xena more blah blah

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:44.860
blah don't talk to me don't add me okay

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:48.100
um she pulls out a flamethrower and just

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.610
torches her lights are on fire burns her

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.339
to death

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.050
someone on Twitter responded in in a way

00:12:51.339 --> 00:12:55.450
that I thought was like the most

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.280
applicable explanation of what was

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.410
happening there and it's like if I ever

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.630
ask you to mercy kill me please make

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.220
sure you do it with the most

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:06.040
excruciating method of execution ever

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:08.320
invented by mankind the moment just

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.700
struck me as like you know the I was

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.640
gonna say the developers you know the

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.120
movie makers they were like this is

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.250
gonna be cool

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.020
there's also I don't even want to talk

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.810
about there's some weird stuff that goes

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:24.020
on and in movie like there's a proto

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:25.910
alien that gets born and it like it's

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.390
murdering people because it's just

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:31.040
filled with hatred which is I mean the

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.570
alien murders people I'm not gonna

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.720
suggest that that's never happened in an

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:38.090
alien movie before but when it sees

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:42.890
Ellen Ripley the clone from the Year

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:44.240
8,000 goes uh you know is hey Ellen

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.980
Ripley I'm not gonna murder you cuz

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.930
you're my mother and I can sense that

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.170
somehow and you're like okay it's a

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:54.230
little weird but I'll allow it

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:56.210
come on I know I haven't talked about

00:13:54.230 --> 00:14:00.260
Isaac in a while here but there's like a

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:02.030
weird scene where it like it almost and

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.690
I'm not even making this up I'm not

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:08.360
embellishing at all it seems for a

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:10.670
minute in Alien Resurrection like Ellen

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:14.480
Ripley is gonna make out with the proto

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:17.810
alien and I'm not even that weirded out

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.250
by the fact that it looks like they're

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.770
gonna make out and she's gonna make out

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.360
with an alien cuz like I mean it's weird

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:27.160
it wouldn't be the weirdest thing in

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.840
that movie but it's pretty weird the

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.450
actual weirdest thing about it is that

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.720
the alien is technically her son so it's

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:38.930
like some weird kind of like mother's

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:42.230
son but also your son is an alien sort

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.730
of like it wasn't really a love interest

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.290
that wouldn't suggest that that's what

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.480
they were shooting for but the way that

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:49.670
they frame the shot sort of calls that

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.050
into question you can find the shot for

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.610
yourself I would also encourage you to

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.420
find the shot from the climax of the

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:58.100
film where Wynonna rider and Sigourney

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.300
Weaver are fighting the proto alien

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.350
because it's just madness anyway

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.300
basically what I'm trying to get it is

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.640
I'm glad school is back in session for

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:10.100
me so I have an excuse to you know once

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.860
a week when I'm doing my labs and

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.390
assignments I can put on the movie now

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.040
or can watch something that's horrible

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.740
that I've never seen before I am

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.000
definitely not upset that I spent two

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.350
and a half hours because there are ads

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.590
it wasn't on showcase

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:28.120
I'm not upset that I spent two and a

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.060
half hours watching an Alien

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:34.690
Resurrection cuz dude I honestly think

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:37.390
it helped me appreciate Prometheus more

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.670
and I'm not joking with you in the least

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:42.250
at least Prometheus has some interesting

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.470
questions and is shot beautifully and I

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:47.280
won't give that movie more praise than

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:50.080
it deserves but it is shot beautifully

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.360
in Alien Resurrection there is a scene

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.100
you're like there's some really stupid

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.570
stuff and Prometheus and I don't know if

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.910
I can get behind what you're saying here

00:15:55.570 --> 00:16:00.520
yeah well in Prometheus is there a scene

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:04.300
where a man who has two guns attached to

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:07.090
his hands shoots a bullet deliberately

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.520
to ricochet it off of two light fixtures

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:12.040
and hit his captor in the face because

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.020
that happens in Alien Resurrection not

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.040
really in keeping with the sci-fi horror

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:19.630
theme of the original in my perspective

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.790
let's let's continue to go for some fire

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:26.380
rate up here we got a little bit of time

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:28.570
left before we have to before we have to

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.040
worry about donating we're probably

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.690
gonna win this room pretty easily

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.180
I would like to crank up our speed a

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.760
little bit more just so we can get away

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:39.340
from our own shots oh my good crown of

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.280
light is quite good and that bit helps

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:51.970
with our speed issue anyway so that's

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:54.880
that's my my live blogging for Alien

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:57.610
Resurrection I enjoyed it

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.370
but I I hated the movie I enjoyed the

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.020
experience of watching it well that is

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.260
about Taylor billing for Noah wasn't

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:07.030
John Paul's you know don't don't lie to

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.830
me you can lie to the investors but you

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:12.160
can't lie to me

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:13.990
devil tower son chaos you take chaos and

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.340
ten out of ten now we can use the gods

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.930
because as long as we have chaos for the

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:21.540
greed fight we have actually just won

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.540
the run this is an easy one dude I

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:26.230
really and this is not rare by the way

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.020
this is extremely common but I really

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:31.180
really like watching bad movies like so

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.920
bad it's good is my ideal kind of movie

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.270
of course you know if you're like hey do

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.809
you want to go see a movie that's good

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.719
yeah I'm

00:17:35.809 --> 00:17:41.690
you want to go see you want to go see

00:17:38.719 --> 00:17:44.690
inglourious brewster i'm in i don't want

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:46.700
to get demonetized you see you want to

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.989
go see trying to think of like some

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.149
stuff in the past few years that's been

00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:51.830
amazing I know a lot of people sort of

00:17:50.149 --> 00:17:53.960
like look down on it is like faux

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.429
intellectual at this point but you want

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.899
to go see inception dude

00:17:55.429 --> 00:18:01.969
sign me up I think it's a very

00:17:56.899 --> 00:18:03.859
imaginative blockbuster no question you

00:18:01.969 --> 00:18:05.659
want to go see Darren Aronofsky's film

00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:07.399
the fountain I think it's a little bit

00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:10.729
up its own butt but you know what it has

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:12.109
some interesting stuff going on I was in

00:18:10.729 --> 00:18:14.570
the theaters for opening night of

00:18:12.109 --> 00:18:16.369
Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche New York

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.799
starring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman

00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:21.889
so I can get down with the with the arts

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:23.330
but if you were like hey dude I got some

00:18:21.889 --> 00:18:26.210
Doritos you want to come over and watch

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:28.549
the Bulls Dungeon Siege in the name of

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:30.739
the king starring Ray Liotta Matthew

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:33.409
Lillard and Ron Perlman and also Jason

00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:34.940
Statham I would be like I am there

00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:40.399
yesterday

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:43.700
sign me up so yes I know what you're

00:18:40.399 --> 00:18:46.609
gonna ask I am a height for the disaster

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.379
artist I got the book when it first came

00:18:46.609 --> 00:18:51.109
out and I had a thought it was an

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:52.700
enjoyable read it brought some insight

00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:54.889
into the making of the room the world's

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.710
most notoriously so bad it's good movie

00:18:54.889 --> 00:18:59.539
and with good reason

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:02.869
and I'm excited to see the movie

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:04.879
adaptation it's also pretty rare to get

00:19:02.869 --> 00:19:07.099
a movie about making movies especially

00:19:04.879 --> 00:19:09.919
about making a bad movie it's like I'm

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:10.940
try the bow finger was in there I'm

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:12.649
trying to think of if there's anything

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:16.089
else that even qualifies I don't know if

00:19:12.649 --> 00:19:19.879
there is but so yes I'm I'm invested

00:19:16.089 --> 00:19:21.130
well I'm not invested but I'm all watch

00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:22.930
it

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.270
six weeks after it comes out on an

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.010
airplane uh let's move along and this is

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.820
I'm just gonna warn you in advance here

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.670
it's gonna be a little bit on the

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.930
shorter side as far as efforts go today

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.540
not because I'm in a rush but because I

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.940
can't not be in a rush with this epic

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:39.720
act damage we're on the final floor

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:42.970
before the the actual boss fight I think

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:48.520
we're one away from becoming Guppies so

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:50.760
I'm like real tempted I'm not gonna do

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.050
it just yet

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.740
unlimited bombs doesn't matter too much

00:19:53.050 --> 00:20:00.610
we should be able to very easily be

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:05.350
careful here two more cents should be

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:06.820
able to very easily finish off all these

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:10.390
waves before we actually fight the

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:14.260
bosses and we might as well use like our

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:16.480
strength card for example because we

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:19.780
really are just gonna use the chaos card

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.900
immediately and and destroy the final

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:25.620
boss so we pretty much can't be killed

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:29.020
we got they were doing 78 damages shot

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.820
it's up there not quite the highest

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.290
damage you know that's ever existed that

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.120
was I didn't mean to step on that but at

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.260
least we were invincible and we did not

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.570
quite the highest damage that has ever

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.160
existed but it's it's up there for you

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.570
know having created it on the fly

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.990
without using like cheat engine is

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:45.250
something I don't mean the do the people

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.780
doing the investigative work with

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.940
cheatengine are actually cheating I just

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.920
mean to say you know it if you give

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.870
yourself all the the damage upgrades and

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.640
multipliers you conceivably can it could

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:58.410
ever get then that's one thing but to

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.410
find this stuff in the wild is like

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:08.419
impressive just on a on a sheer like

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:12.859
variance level two lives

00:21:08.419 --> 00:21:15.289
two are still living could use a range

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:17.299
upgrade as lame as that sounds had to

00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:17.889
say with like 78 damage working in your

00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:20.690
favor

00:21:17.889 --> 00:21:22.789
pretty sweet spawns if I was bottom-left

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.200
monstro I'd be real cheese that the

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:28.009
developers made me spawn in the middle

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:32.450
of a fire but you know what do I know to

00:21:28.009 --> 00:21:35.809
scolex know I forget the name of these

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:38.409
jerks but I know the sound they make

00:21:35.809 --> 00:21:38.409
when they die

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:51.380
we don't actually need HP sure it would

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.770
have been better to have not blown

00:21:51.380 --> 00:22:01.400
myself up about 12 times but we don't

00:21:54.770 --> 00:22:02.600
need the HP is the thing the chaos card

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:07.000
should handle it for us even if it

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:09.320
doesn't we should be totally okay but

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.960
you know desperate times call for

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.150
desperate measures it I'm gonna be the

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.120
world's lamest boy cuz I just don't see

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.920
a good reason to become Guffey if we're

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.960
just gonna kill the next boss in one hit

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:26.150
anyway and we'll donate all this money

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.070
instead that way we have to do less

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.360
greed modes would you you know you might

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:35.510
be saying well you don't like greed mode

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:36.950
I'm okay with greed mode but I'm I'd

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.640
rather if we're gonna do like

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:42.260
recreational greed mode just do greedy

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.630
or instead dude so the faster we get

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.880
through greed mode the better our lives

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:52.130
are so we get sensor it's not a terrible

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:54.350
item maybe not ten out of ten but more

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.550
angel items I'm not gonna say it's

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:59.840
always a good thing because I guess in

00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:01.460
theory it could be actually bad if it

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.860
dilutes the pool and makes things more

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:08.390
garbage but all right so we're gonna

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:10.040
donate seven cents or five we're gonna

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.070
donate five cents then we'll grab all

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.040
this could get almost all the way to 600

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:18.140
plus we unlock the sensor which is

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.240
another angel pool item not an

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.680
unproductive run as Maggie here today

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.940
and we've got a pretty good track record

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.540
in green mode I think we also just moved

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.440
up to a five streak which is a start

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.430
considering where we're deliberately

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:36.580
making things hard on ourselves

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:36.580
sometimes it's a start I again

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:42.490
just give me a button that is like

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:44.080
donate all money in what situation here

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.530
would you ever be like don't donate all

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.530
money

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:49.840
oh but NL they have to calculate the

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.580
odds of it actually like messing up on a

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.480
shot-by-shot basis you know you could do

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:58.920
this your computer has like 640 million

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:01.750
megabytes of RAM or something like that

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.400
they can calculate whether and like the

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.050
chances of you actually being able to

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.030
donate and how much you would be able to

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:12.040
donate if the if you've got a bad role

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:14.470
in like 180th of a second why do I have

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.929
to spend my precious life force holding

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:21.190
down the S key to go cut um cut tongue

00:24:16.929 --> 00:24:22.750
cut tongue maybe saying an L what do you

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.080
want to do walk into a casino give them

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:27.640
a hundred bucks and say how did I do

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.340
maybe maybe maybe you're right maybe

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.020
that's maybe that's the kind of guy I am

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:35.230
that was very strange there but either

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.910
way dude pretty productive we've got to

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.890
be close to unlocking something new from

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.809
this as well but for now thanks for

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.920
