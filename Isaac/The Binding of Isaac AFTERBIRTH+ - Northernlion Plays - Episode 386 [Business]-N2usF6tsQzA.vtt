##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.000
hey everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.290
please Binding of Isaac after birth plus

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.559
what's the plus the pluses for me

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.099
because I hey it's it's plus the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.540
indomitable spirit of northernlion as he

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.640
tries to knock out something with

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.180
apollyon and really on this run we can

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.949
do just about freaking anything for kpy

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.500
3 trusts 3 truck you know what they say

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.630
three trade charm you know what my dream

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.890
novel is I think and then I literally

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.899
just came up with this right now so it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
might actually be a really stupid idea

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.500
like you ever meet somebody who's they

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.300
come up with an idea right on the top of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.370
their head and then they become so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.750
protective of it despite having no

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.570
rigorous analysis because they think

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
it's genius I think the answer to that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.820
question should be yes like I'm gonna be

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.800
honest with you you know sometimes

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.239
someone on the NL SS will bring up a an

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.699
idea they'll be like oh we should make a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.619
game that's like this and I put on my

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.869
you know extremely like oh I know how to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.450
write hello world face and ideas are

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.180
worthless but I got an app idea in my

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
head that I think is like a 10 out of 10

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.450
or no I'm not going to tell you what it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.130
is because I'm a hypocrite and because I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
think I do possess the skills to make it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.189
I just need to get off my butt and I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.750
told some people about it and they were

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.659
like that's stupid it can't be done and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.330
I was like you'll all see you all lack

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.000
vision but wait until you see this but

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.850
now my dream book let's be honest my

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
dream audio book because I I like

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.310
reading I don't do it as much as I

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.560
should but I've been taking a lot of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.780
walks recently I like the concept of an

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.030
audiobook I love the concept of Jacob's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.909
Ladder as well here not the book Jacob's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.729
Ladder which as I understand it is a

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.680
psychological horror deep dive into the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.860
darkest parts of man's psyche but either

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.439
way what about a book that analyzes

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.549
idioms like third time's a charm and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.659
then provides actual data or at least

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.670
interviews with academic professionals

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.840
to determine and analyze whether or not

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.780
that idiom is true because it was

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.660
thinking you know there might be like a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.150
mental

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.830
andhe never reason for why third time's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.060
the charm a I mean it might be

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.500
completely you know myth-busting right

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.660
but it might actually make sense maybe

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.100
you know the first time the human brain

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.210
you know it can handle it goes all I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.100
don't understand there's too much

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.470
novelty here I think there's only one

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.360
possible a a few possible locations for

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.770
the secret room but not many but let's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.910
go to our shop instead actually you

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.620
might be able to get something in there

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.120
the first time you're like I don't know

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.380
all the factors I mean the second time

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.090
you build on what you learned on the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.470
third the first time and then the third

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.150
time you got enough information to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.520
potentially succeed you know I wouldn't

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.550
be surprised if third time's a charm it

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.210
turns out to actually be fairly I'm not

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.800
going to say always correct but if it

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.360
turns out to have some value behind it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.370
same thing with beginner's luck you know

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.780
I think that despite them seeming at

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.790
odds with one another I do think that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.970
beginner's luck might have like a mild

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.050
wait isn't it is like a super tinted

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.440
rock there you see the X on that right I

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.970
see the X on it at least and if I'm

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.920
seeing things that nobody else is seeing

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.440
I'm either in trouble or you're all in a

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.810
great deal of trouble so I haven't been

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.520
known as the most observant player in

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.220
this game I think was beginner's luck

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.100
like you ever get like just good enough

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.570
at a fighting game to be mad but not

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.760
good enough to actually beat other good

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.140
players that's like my perfect example

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.650
of beginner's luck because you play like

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.330
you know 30 hours of Street Fighter and

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.950
then your friend comes over and you're

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.630
like hey let's play this it'll be fun

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.190
really I just want to excuse to stop you

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.450
though and then be self righteous like

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.610
you'll bro you should have practice

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.620
before you dude would you want to just

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.780
be handed a victory do you want to have

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.700
fun without any suffering sorry that's

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.300
not allowed anyway and then you just

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.100
beats you by like basically mashing

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.840
buttons and just spamming low kick over

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.520
and over or something like that that's

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.120
my perfect example of beginner's luck

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.799
they don't know what to focus on and as

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.120
a result they can sometimes focus on oh

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.590
Jesus that actually could have killed me

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.430
that was the perfect storm if I was

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.340
standing like just slightly below it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.280
luckily I wasn't but still

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.290
anyway I digress here that's that's my

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.270
dream audio book I'm not saying you

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.010
should write it you know I guess you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.120
write an audio book and then it becomes

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.910
a book and then if it sells well

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.200
probably your email inbox fills up with

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.020
people that will just read the audio

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.030
book for you and then like submit it to

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.480
audible and only take like 95 percent of

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.930
your sales I'm not suggesting you should

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.220
do it first off you got to be qualified

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.110
I'm not suggesting that you're an

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.150
unqualified lot watching these that was

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.650
a really good voice actually we got to

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.780
basically be equivalent in two tiers

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.280
upgrade but you know I just you can't

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.950
just be like I've got a good idea for a

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.120
for a book that's nonfiction I'm gonna

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.860
write it you know you got to do the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.540
research first secondly I don't know

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.810
about the the whole book industry these

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.090
days if you wrote like ready player to

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.570
you might be okay but I don't know about

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.700
this this is incredibly precious book

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.380
that's like algorithms to live by which

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.360
I mentioned reading a couple of times

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.210
recently but but for like the English

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.400
language I don't know an analysis of

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.229
idioms you got to come up with a good

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.890
title for it if the first thing would be

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.930
like you know don't throw the baby out

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.690
with the bathwater under analysis of

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.919
idioms in the English language for you

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.870
got to throw something at the end there

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.820
like for cool kids so hey I I don't

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.610
understand book titles to some extent

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.600
like I'm looking to learn JavaScript

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.830
okay I will accept no dissent on this

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.270
people I know people are going to have

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.080
opinions it doesn't matter okay I'm

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.940
looking to learn JavaScript so at Google

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.560
that was like best JavaScript book for

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.850
people who know how to program at least

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.300
a little bit but don't know any

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.570
JavaScript and then one of the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.930
suggestions that came up was this book

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.240
called

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.950
JavaScript the good parts and then I

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.200
went to the Kindle Store please don't

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.370
have enemies in here thank you I went to

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.140
the Kindle Store on Amazon and they

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.770
didn't have JavaScript the good parts

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:34.960
but what they had is no spirit hearts

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.510
huh-uh here upon oh he's done it genuine

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.190
excitement what they had was JavaScript

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.410
the good parts :

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.890
good parts as like am I really gonna pay

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.690
you $28 for this book the answer 28

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.430
Canadian dollars admittedly which you

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.470
know the dollars coming back up it used

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.740
to be Oh what is that look for American

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.380
dollars yeah it used to be like pretty

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.790
the exchange rate for like at least the

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.200
past two years have been pretty bad but

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:04.030
it's coming back we're not quite at par

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.920
yet but honestly the I like it when the

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.360
Canadian dollars well when it calls me

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.160
Big Poppa for one but I like it when the

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.610
Canadian dollar is bad because it makes

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.380
me essentially like get a huge raise for

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.240
no reason despite working the exact same

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.240
amount and probably if anything growing

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.610
more talentless by the day hey making my

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.370
skills worse so the answer is yes I did

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.900
buy JavaScript the good parts : the good

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.070
parts I I think it might just be an

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.490
error in the way that that book is

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.050
titled

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.400
and then I read like a hundred pages of

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.190
it and I was like oh wait you've got a

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.750
it's not particularly good there you got

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:40.480
to know HTML and CSS to learn JavaScript

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.830
now it's like I started on that not that

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.830
this is like northern liens you know

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.169
daily vlog of how free code camp is

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.169
going but the answer is swimmingly

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:54.700
because the first leg part of that is

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:59.100
extremely easy but anyway let's move on

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:02.260
here dude I got to level with you we

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.650
have such an Isaac backlog right now

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:09.190
because for years I've been I built up

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:11.169
the habit of recording enough Isaac to

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:14.460
build a backlog while sustaining to

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:16.419
three or four videos per day of Isaac

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.540
exclusively now that we're down to one

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:22.900
Isaac video a day I can put in like a

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:26.010
half a workday once a week and that's

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.750
enough Isaac for that week and it's I'm

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.669
accidentally working way too much

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.640
specifically with respect to Isaac and

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:36.190
now I'm realizing you know if I'd

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.960
reprioritize that time let's look as can

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.700
come back you know more random streams

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.210
can come back it's taken me a while to

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.480
adjust to this and it hasn't been like

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:48.760
you know two years of one a day Isaac to

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.389
learn this wow you are so lucky with

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.569
your

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:54.759
with your placements there but still

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:57.339
it's been an adjustment period all you

00:08:54.759 --> 00:09:01.299
got it and then you just suck that up

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:08.709
and it seemed pretty good I do really

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:13.329
really want to get I hate this really

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:18.910
really want to get a zigga zagga ah that

00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:20.290
is our second secret room but you know I

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.339
really want to get into that second

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.670
secret room is what I was going to say

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:27.189
and then the other thing that I was

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.720
suggesting oh it was totally worth it

00:09:27.189 --> 00:09:31.420
despite being very scary let's get the

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.929
heck out of here um is that it's nice

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.720
you know

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:35.920
I've built up again these habits that

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.389
I've lived my life by it's like I got

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.249
used to eating a Big Mac every single

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:42.089
day and now I'm over here like having

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:44.290
you know garbanzo bean salads for lunch

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:46.600
takes me a while to figure out you know

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.019
to adjust to get homeostatic with that

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.220
if that makes sense but I'm hopeful that

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:52.420
you know what we're doing one Isaac

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.919
video a day I think it's going to

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.720
accomplish especially with the new save

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:58.749
files can accomplish a couple of things

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.279
ideally for me one is allows me to you

00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:01.509
know reintroduce more variety to the

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.829
channel which i think is important

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:04.480
something the channels in a bad state

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:07.239
but people are like you know it'd be

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.459
nice to have more variety I am an idiot

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:12.850
there and and I don't disagree with you

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:14.889
hey it ended up being it may be a wash

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:18.369
but that's fine

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:19.959
and the other thing is that it kind of

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:22.179
like concentrates the Isaac you know

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:25.059
it's let's use a Kerbal space program

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:27.100
analogy there might be like a little bit

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:28.869
of evergreen fuel for The Binding of

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.339
Isaac like people who will always either

00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:31.660
like watching the game because they love

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.860
the game or like watching the game

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.929
because they like what it does to my

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.419
commentary goes off in a non sequiturs

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:40.319
you know it's kind of like a vlog

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:43.660
without the B part you know what I mean

00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:44.889
and that's cool I like that but you know

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.529
I don't want to I don't want to burn it

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:48.730
all up I think I got a lot of tweets in

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:50.879
particular from people that are like I

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:53.829
stopped watching Isaac completely but

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:55.540
you know now that there's a new save

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:57.879
file and only one episode a day it seems

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:01.280
easier to kind of stick with it and make

00:10:57.879 --> 00:11:05.520
it part of the routine I understand that

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.900
you know if you go away of a bee you

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.190
pride yourself you're the kind of person

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.010
who like needs to see every single

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.000
episode of something in order to feel

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.820
like you're up on it

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.530
well you know if you go away for a

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.940
vacation for like four days and there

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.070
are four Isaac videos a day that's like

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.450
16 hours of I have to catch up on I

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.880
think we should take this in this case

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:27.690
that's that's tough doesn't does not an

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:30.240
easy job I mean from an employment

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.500
standpoint is kind of an easy job just

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.200
have it on in the background while you

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.940
you know do other stuff but it's it's a

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.230
gargantuan task is what I should be

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.020
saying this is a little bit more on that

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:46.310
the same side which i think is important

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:49.500
but regardless I'm moving along here I

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:53.280
have a unique phenomenon in my life and

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:57.140
I'm not suggesting that I'm you know

00:11:53.280 --> 00:12:01.140
some kind of special person here but I

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.880
am constantly paranoid of the well you

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.520
got speeding shot feet and tears so it's

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.900
pretty good about the weirdest stuff and

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.280
I'm going to give you a specific example

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.710
so you don't think that I've completely

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.720
lost my mind

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:15.240
we whenever we talk about this year's

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.250
PAX East on the N LSS one of the

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.810
recurring themes is and I'm sorry if

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.970
you're from Boston for multiple reasons

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:23.160
so I gotta say I'm a Canucks fan so like

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:27.180
you got the last laugh but let me have a

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:30.810
couple of low blows here right is the

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.760
quality of service in Boston was a

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:36.600
little bit lacking from our perspective

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:38.280
and some people have told us yeah I've

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.930
been to Boston the servers were jerks

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.760
and some people have told us hey you

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.970
guys are picky and I'm like oh we found

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.720
the person from Boston but because we've

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:51.660
railed on that so much I now find myself

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.430
being extraordinarily polite at

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:57.570
restaurants and this came to a head last

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:58.770
night because I worry that the person

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.210
serving me it's probably a

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.430
low-percentage chance but that they

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.590
might be familiar with my work and just

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.180
not letting on you know because of

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.450
professional decorum or whatever and

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:14.270
they're going to be like a hyper alert

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:16.070
of the idea that you know I

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:19.040
they might think that I'm rude the

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:22.460
service staff so I am like on my best

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.920
behavior like we had a server last night

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:27.560
and I'm just going to be honest he

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.860
looked like my people you know I I have

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:33.820
a demographic I can see that data

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.230
there's a very cosmopolitan

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:40.280
cross-section of people who watch me but

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:44.330
you know they are largely between the

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:46.790
ages of eighteen and thirty and to some

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.260
extent you know like thirty to forty on

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:52.130
top of that but largely eighteen to

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:54.880
thirty or lying about their age and in

00:13:52.130 --> 00:14:00.980
the YouTube accounts two things I guess

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:04.100
they're largely male like ninety-one

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.620
percent male or something like that and

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.570
I think you know I'm making inferences

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.420
but you got to be a certain kind of

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:13.820
person to watch this sort of content

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.910
that I make like I'm definitely not the

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:19.580
kind of guy who's like you know top five

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:21.260
sweet low rides uh we don't want to suck

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.370
this up unfortunately I'm going to stick

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:26.080
with this even though it celebrities

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:28.510
lovely I make content that is meandering

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.320
and I mean that is a negative

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:36.110
verbose a little bit esoteric abstract I

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.910
mean those as positives irreverent and I

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.080
think oftentimes they manifest when

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.330
someone's physical appearance although

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.710
not always you know you look like I'm

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.780
just being straight out here you look

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:48.020
like a college student and I'd you know

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.790
that's my people I think we can pick

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.560
this up and get one tiers upgrade out of

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.870
it at least

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.890
sweet and we're kind of rushing here so

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.780
let's slow down and go to our cursed

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.340
room I think we can afford it now not to

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.880
mention you know donate on our shop

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:05.420
maybe a little bit and he was like hi my

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:08.330
name is um Drax I obviously named move

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.800
for his privacy and I'll be your server

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.190
like the first person who came to take

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.740
your orders like going off for the night

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:18.320
so we'll the let's get it sorted and he

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.150
was kind of like he was making confident

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.840
eye contact with me and that's not weird

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:26.899
that's not unusual and I think you know

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.180
a prouder man might think that you know

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:31.160
he was trying to come on to me that is

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:36.740
not the expectation that I had in the

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:38.930
least because I'm aware of myself

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.689
what are we nothing oh we got the pill

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.129
right yeah this was like super not worth

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:44.300
it but let's donate some money I don't

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:47.600
really care about an arcade at this

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.009
point and I was like oh my litter Li the

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.509
first thought that came to my head I

00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:51.889
mean just so happen to be the best song

00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:53.269
in the world it was the best song in the

00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:55.610
world but it also happened to be this

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:59.660
guy watches the NL SS and he's going to

00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:01.490
be looking for a reason to judge me so

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.639
every time he come back and be like you

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.379
know

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:06.529
hey how's everything going and I'd be

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:10.040
like it's fantastic tracks I'm probably

00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:13.189
laying it on a little thick how's the

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.259
food so far it's amazing it was all

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:17.209
right you know what can I get you

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:19.670
anything no just your wonderful

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:21.170
hospitality has been it's meant the

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:26.600
world to us Drax now he probably thought

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:31.429
I was coming on to him I don't want the

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.600
two of hearts uh save half a spear at

00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:33.620
our we don't need the emperor card we

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.920
can find another teleport card

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:40.189
potentially on the next floor but I live

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.709
my constant life or my life constantly I

00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:45.160
should say in fear of being just famous

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:48.230
enough to be ruined I suppose is the

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:51.110
distillation of that the idea that

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:54.470
nobody knows who I am on mass like I

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:56.089
walk around very anonymously because I'm

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:59.449
essentially a nobody

00:16:56.089 --> 00:17:01.009
in downtown Vancouver but if I was

00:16:59.449 --> 00:17:02.629
really mean to somebody at a coffee shop

00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:06.289
that's we could still blow up it

00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:08.510
entitled YouTube star doesn't say thank

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:12.110
you enough times when he gets his donut

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.459
from the hard-working class all yell I

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.179
always Lou they were entitled but this

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:17.569
is ridiculous

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:19.610
like I'm constantly I wouldn't say

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.620
paranoid and it depends who I'm

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.120
interacting with and it may be this is

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.640
not fair and a little judgmental of me

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.649
but if I'm interacting with like you

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:31.970
know someone that's in their 60s I'm

00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:34.090
like there's a very very low percentage

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:38.409
chance that

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:39.940
you have any idea of who I am and that

00:17:38.409 --> 00:17:43.600
means we can interact on the level and I

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:45.640
can be my true self it hey old man give

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.669
me a honey cruller you piece of cover

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:54.610
fish salad that's how I talk to people

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:56.679
on a regular basis mostly because I'm

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:59.980
just so you know low blood sugar I need

00:17:56.679 --> 00:18:04.890
that honey cruller ASAP you losing me my

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:06.820
jury if I'm interacting with somebody I

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.130
don't know you just kind of see

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:13.059
something in their eyes sometimes I'm

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:16.049
like this guy or this girl knows so much

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:18.880
more about me than I know about them

00:18:16.049 --> 00:18:22.659
like the playing field is not level like

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:26.860
you've you've heard my darkest fears and

00:18:22.659 --> 00:18:29.620
admissions and embarrassing stories and

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.690
then I meet you and you know I just see

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:36.640
it in your eyes that you're more aware

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:39.130
of the of me than I am of you and it I'm

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.190
like I got to be particularly nice here

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.090
or this could all go wrong sure I'll

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.950
take dark matter

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:49.390
we've got 12 damaged things are looking

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:50.830
great I don't love many of these items

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.370
right off the bat I think we should just

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:58.750
suck them all up that was a surprisingly

00:18:54.370 --> 00:19:03.640
like not that valuable suck there we got

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:07.559
like a little damage shot speed

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.559
essentially like completely irrelevant

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:15.309
okay I'm asking this question from an

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:18.490
honest standpoint okay how do you walk

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:20.799
what are the rules of the sidewalk the

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:24.850
same as the rules of the road because

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:27.880
I've I've been going through this you

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.980
know for years I'm a fast Walker I'm not

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.419
the fastest Walker I have walked with

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:35.590
people who walk faster than me and I

00:19:31.419 --> 00:19:36.909
find it unpleasant wow it didn't even

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.620
raise our tier rate

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:42.410
I have watched with people who walk

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:45.270
faster than me a fire walked with people

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.860
and I you know but you're like I kind of

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.020
get it because your natural walking

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.590
speed is that fast and actually I still

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.510
think

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.730
barring any sort of like physical

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.440
ailment that precludes you from walking

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.470
it quickly it's actually like more work

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:05.250
to slow down than it is to speed up to

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:08.670
match their place but nothing I get

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:11.430
rattled dude when I walk on the sidewalk

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.990
and in North America or in I won't speak

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.950
for all North America because I've never

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:18.500
been to like Barbados but in in Canada

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.420
you drive on the right side of the road

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:24.150
so I always walk on the right side of

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.470
the road I walk on the right side of the

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.000
sidewalk I should say in if there's

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.920
people coming in the opposite direction

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.300
I always expect them to be walking on

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.620
the right side of the road and in that

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.000
way we'll never collide because we're

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.820
walking on different sizes we're facing

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.710
different directions but I'm not sure if

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.020
it's happening more regularly or if I'm

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.940
just you know hyper focused and in tune

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.570
to observe things that I can talk about

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.160
on the NL SS many many times recently

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.190
I'm walking on the right side of the

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.330
road person coming at me walking on the

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.210
left side of the road we're on a

00:20:54.330 --> 00:21:00.150
collision course I maybe I'm petty here

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:02.910
I don't move I'm on the right side of

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:06.480
the road near collisions and I'm these

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:08.460
are people because I mean if I wanted to

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.320
be extremely like Millennials are

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.970
killing the walking industry boys see I

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.460
be like oh they're always looking at

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:17.010
their cell phone playing Digimon goalie

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:22.290
whatever no but these are people that

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:25.170
are like just walking now looking at

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:27.030
their cell phone I don't understand like

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.500
maybe it says something about me my

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.170
first reaction is like are you from

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.570
England are you from England you just

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:36.720
haven't adjusted that's what's weird

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:39.900
about being in Japan is that like they

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.730
would they walk in in Tokyo they walk on

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.990
I can't remember which which ones which

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.650
now but I'm pretty sure in Tokyo they

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:48.000
walk on the left side of the street and

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:50.200
then they you know stand on the right

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.029
side this is for like escalators

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.470
and then in Osaka they're just like now

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:53.889
we do it the opposite way here for no

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.190
reason

00:21:53.889 --> 00:21:59.049
that's like 20% of me being in Japan is

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.179
adjusting to what side of the street to

00:21:59.049 --> 00:22:02.679
walk on so I don't feel like I'm being a

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:06.820
stick-in-the-mud for the people who live

00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:08.109
there and I'm in my city people are

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.440
walking on the wrong side the road but

00:22:08.109 --> 00:22:12.369
am I wrong to not get out of the way

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.809
someone's got to get out of the way or

00:22:12.369 --> 00:22:16.929
we're going to collide if it comes down

00:22:13.809 --> 00:22:17.859
to like the final second I'll get out of

00:22:16.929 --> 00:22:19.359
the way because I'm not going to bump

00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:21.039
into a stranger on the street to prove a

00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:23.559
point you know I have better things to

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:25.299
do with my time not not many better

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:26.950
things to do with my time I mean again

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:29.739
the Isaac backlog is getting pretty long

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:33.159
here I got better things to do with my

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:36.279
time so I don't know if it's like

00:22:33.159 --> 00:22:37.509
they're trying to like convert I think

00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:39.070
we should just take it that we should

00:22:37.509 --> 00:22:43.029
give us a it didn't give us a tears

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:45.519
upgrade but we broke the cap we needed

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:46.869
the HP regardless I thought that we

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:48.070
needed the HP in advance of the deal

00:22:46.869 --> 00:22:49.330
with the devil anyway we'll get a deal

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.679
with the devil next floor to get back to

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.539
permanent polaroid invincibility

00:22:50.679 --> 00:22:55.029
either way we probably want to do the

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:57.129
hush fight really because we can knock

00:22:55.029 --> 00:23:01.059
it out on this run are they trying to

00:22:57.129 --> 00:23:03.220
like make us a left walking country is

00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:04.529
all that's I stepped on the button I'm

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:09.549
just saying

00:23:04.529 --> 00:23:11.289
or is it is it like an ego thing because

00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:12.429
I'm just going to be honest with you

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:15.100
I've made a lot of sweeping

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:16.570
generalizations about you know age and

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.809
gender over the course of this video why

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:22.539
stop now if I'm walking on the sidewalk

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:24.639
and coming the other way is like young

00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:26.590
20s dude with an affliction shirt and he

00:23:24.639 --> 00:23:28.720
refuses to get out of the way I'll take

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.330
it I I do think that that's kind of like

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:36.730
a you know that guy's like check it out

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:39.039
dude I just totally like turn that guy

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.480
into a beta like I'm fine with that

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:42.269
whatever you think you'd turn me into a

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.409
beta I'm a married man

00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:46.629
what do you doing getting your Honda

00:23:44.409 --> 00:23:48.820
Civic that's got a freaking you know the

00:23:46.629 --> 00:23:50.919
Shocker symbol on the back two in the

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.179
pink one of the sink bro by the way does

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:54.129
anyone know what the pink looks like

00:23:52.179 --> 00:23:55.480
because I've never seen it either way I

00:23:54.129 --> 00:23:58.989
don't know why that has to be a surfer

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:02.240
bro that says something about my my

00:23:58.989 --> 00:24:03.650
innate biases I suppose

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.220
and that's that's fine you know that's

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:09.740
life life is that you there will always

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.179
be dudes try to you know give you like a

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.350
super strong handshake because they

00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:14.809
think that it makes them like a bigger

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:17.240
man it might seem like I'm basing that

00:24:14.809 --> 00:24:22.040
off of recent politics but I not known

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:24.080
many people like that in my day you know

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.840
firm and shake is one thing a handshake

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.760
that becomes a dominant game is some

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.070
like door to door vacuum cleaner

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:36.500
salesman madness in my opinion either

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:40.460
way some uncle Rico garbage okay I may

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:45.340
die here just from walking on nonsense

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.340
so how about we just don't instead I

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:57.200
gotta focus this isn't how I go okay

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:01.880
yeah yeah war you're doing a great job

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:03.440
buddy that was the most important dodge

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.730
of our lives so I'm going to go ahead

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.380
and say we're not going to go to the

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:13.460
hospital right run for it dude we could

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.720
accidentally end up not accomplishing

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.980
anything on this run I actually just

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.570
realized we totally should have done

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:21.950
boss rush because we haven't as apollyon

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.690
so we kind of I think we whipped on a

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:29.740
run that could have been a little bit

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:32.900
more special here too pheromones huh

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:34.730
should be looking for secret rooms what

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:39.170
was they even talking about but if it's

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:40.940
like you know a thirty year old lady

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.820
just walking in the other direction I

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.800
don't think she's trying to like exert a

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.750
level of dominance over me maybe that's

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.550
maybe that's naive of me I honestly

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.260
don't know I don't understand the whole

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.640
walk it maybe they're just you know lost

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.280
in their head you know people have other

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.240
things to worry about rather than you

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.980
know whether they're following the

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.720
correct walking etiquette on the street

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.730
and it says something about how shelter

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.280
to life I've led that as I walk down the

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:06.080
street my number one concern is uh you

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.790
know am i fulfilling the rules of

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.310
society correctly you know other people

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.680
have got you know

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.660
various other things to worry about I

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.730
suppose I don't know what we want the

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:18.520
money for maybe we can get lucky penny

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:21.250
out of it I don't think there's a reason

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.320
to do or not to do another floor the

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.390
real question is do we want to do more

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.220
rooms or do we want to do less rooms and

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.350
I think the less rooms until the chest

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:34.150
is probably the safest bet for us right

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:36.010
now well you know how it is dude you

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.170
make everybody makes assumptions based

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:42.670
on people correct or incorrect about

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:45.820
various factors like if I could I told

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:47.440
that story recently about the time that

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.270
you know Kate was driving just after we

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.920
got our car and she meant to make us or

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:55.770
she went to make a safe lane change and

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.770
then that like douchebag middle-aged guy

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.160
cut her off and did like the finger wag

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.130
you make assumptions about that guy

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.390
based on his age you know you would

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:08.380
assume that anybody who did that would

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:09.970
be an asshole but because it was like a

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.540
50 year old your first assumption is

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:15.340
like wow that dude does tiny schlong and

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.900
it's not getting the attention that he

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.970
feels it deserves because he's taking it

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:23.770
out on other people in his life for

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:28.300
better or worse if we've got lots of

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:29.710
stuff here if I looked over and it was a

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.870
20 year old doing that I would be like

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:35.380
this guy just got done watching the UFC

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:37.390
I'm not trying to suggest that watching

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:40.420
the UFC makes you a meathead not at all

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:42.160
I think there's a lot of you know this

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.840
is not even me being facetious even

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.030
though it's going to sound like it

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.060
there's a lot of like intelligence and

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:50.800
strategy that goes on in that sport but

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:53.200
you get all hopped up on that you know

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.200
Brock Lesnar action just want to choke

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.300
somebody out in the highway I think I've

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.760
been there we me and my friends uh watch

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.160
jackass three and theaters we left the

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.420
theater one of my friends you know

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.490
thought he was johnny Knoxville he

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.860
jumped on my back in the middle of the

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.980
the street I just crumbled like I was

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:16.150
made out of like you know hot aluminum

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:20.760
cans what a strange metaphor to use so

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:20.760
simile a metaphor doesn't use like or as

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:27.020
you know what I mean right

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:29.270
messed up my I came to remember would

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.559
have messed up but it my back didn't

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:34.460
feel right they're like three weeks but

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:35.840
then I bounced back because I was 20 we

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.530
still could die

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:41.540
I think we've played pretty well but we

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:45.620
are guilty of doing what I always do on

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:47.900
these runs and that's going way too deep

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:53.080
and trying to keep all the blood in my

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:55.040
head instead of the win on their game I

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.870
know I'm getting a little bit older

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.080
because the songs I liked when I was 13

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:01.700
are now on the radio and like the radio

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:07.010
station in Vancouver that we listened to

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:09.309
as a compromise is well you're like if

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:11.630
I'm in the car by myself Bluetooth on

00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:14.870
contraband the best of men at work you

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:17.540
know doesn't get to sleep but for both

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:20.120
in the car business radio station they

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:22.910
do like a two-two nude one old sort of

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.800
set up can't do it anyway so we're done

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.820
