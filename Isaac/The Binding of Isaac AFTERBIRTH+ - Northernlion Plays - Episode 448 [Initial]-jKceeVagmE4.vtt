cents please get a key get into that

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.669
item room item room contains HP between

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.059
you know toothpicks HP book a Belial

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.010
nothing could stop us there's got to be

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.390
a penny I refuse to believe there's no

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.960
pennies available in seven poops ade

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.700
poops no pennies that's insulting they

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.829
would treat your fanbase like that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.210
okay I've got eight point seven one

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.360
damage we're not gonna step on the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.309
button yes we could be one-hit ko

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.899
but actually like with a great rate of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.619
fire and eight point seven one damage we

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.180
won't be we're incredibly overpowered

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.770
for the first floor except for HP which

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.320
admittedly is like a real sore spot I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.340
mean you know Donen always seem to go

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.990
you don't know what you got til it's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.979
gone right but I think we may actually

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.960
try to be a little cheeky er than usual

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.220
here we got a great situation but the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.810
way that we can leverage it for

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.540
ourselves is to not go into the the shop

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.860
until we're absolutely done with

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.400
everything cuz then we only use one

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.710
charge of book of Belial instead of

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.450
instead of more than that you know

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.860
impossibly compromising our ability to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.020
use the charge right away on the next

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.700
floor so I mean I'm gonna go out on a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.890
limb and say that I think I'm confident

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.820
that we can beat pretty much all these

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.689
waves in a timely fashion without really

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.130
compromising ourselves too much so let's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.570
just keep keep it going here we should

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.939
get a spirit heart after this we got 12

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.950
seconds as I see it maybe like 15 cuz

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.540
you know boss is oftentimes they spawn

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.270
in and they do a little posturing before

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.740
they even shoot it's kill Larry jr. get

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.909
a spear at heart we didn't get a spear

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.899
at heart instead we got another Larry

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.330
juniors it's like my personal nightmare

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.080
we could choose to forego a deal with

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.810
the devil

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.430
and just you know bank our resources

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.990
from this floor that's a coward's way

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.290
out I don't want to go down in the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.890
history books as a guy big B with a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.780
little P you know what I mean so instead

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.390
we're gonna fight two bosses

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.860
simultaneously that both could murder us

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.190
if they touch us once not my dream job

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.810
right now

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.010
as long as we can keep tabs on both of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.360
them whoa laws we can keep tabs on both

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.820
of them we can put them down pretty

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:55.980
quick let's go no Krampus please okay

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.130
now that's just offensive I would really

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.500
prefer to not use book of Belial here

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.410
it's such a head start for the next

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.450
floor what a waste

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.560
all right well I mean we handled that

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.250
floor very easily you want stigmata I

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.190
mean you you need stigmata here keep

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.959
this ace of clubs not bad not bad

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.880
get Necronomicon it's progress towards

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.670
bookworm but otherwise basically garbage

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.310
ace of clubs turns things into bombs and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.640
jackie treehorn treats objects like

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.840
women man so our game plan go down on

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.500
the next floor hope for HP sorry tinted

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.550
rock hope for HP from one of these

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
starting rooms we can always buy a key

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.000
to start especially if it's three cents

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.709
that'd be very nice but HP is still

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.709
pretty low there's HP fantastic

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.160
we'll probably try to do like more of

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.830
the same honestly hey we're not gonna

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.530
build a winning run out of just Boca

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.330
Belial but it is going well so far we

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.200
certainly I mean we've we've had good

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.010
times with oh there's something there's

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.120
something to this

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:15.970
I see where we're going I see the the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.519
symphony here what we do yeah yeah okay

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.700
this is fine save ourselves a half heart

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.280
ace of clubs two bombs leave we got

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.710
these bombs use these bombs to generate

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.430
10 cents or more or five cents that's

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.510
all so it's just different variation

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.160
we've used sprinkler and sprinklers been

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.960
fun it's not what we want here there we

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.790
go mr. mega is quite nice as well

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.900
pop bookable I'll get ready to go we're

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.190
gonna do the same thing we did last time

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.350
except this time we actually have the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.850
ability to take damage so it's like a

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.980
whole new world we're just gonna save

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.730
money cuz this floor sucks to put it

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.340
quite succinctly you know speedball plus

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.260
the sprinkler sprinkler is a good item I

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.650
don't think it's any book of belial

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.320
though we're gonna hope for maybe a deal

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.910
with the angel I guess like well that

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.040
was I actually physically flinched in

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.320
real life and some of you out there in

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.380
TV land might have as well I don't blame

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.880
you it's a scary situation I'm sorry to

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.410
have put us in a situation where that

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.410
had the chance to perspire

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.960
excuse me

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.979
so outside of the deal with the devil

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.499
this this floor is trash city aka what

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.449
city am I gonna make fun of today

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.799
Edmonton Alberta look I know many of you

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.919
out there might be from but you can take

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:41.789
it you got McDavid Leon draisaitl Cuyler

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.379
Yamamoto

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:48.239
Darnell nurse you know you need to be

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.799
punched up a little bit I see you

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:52.559
punching a Calgary as well for their

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:54.479
arena woes look I'll make fun of Calgary

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.069
all day long it's good-natured fun but

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.649
still I'm glad somebody's holding out

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.719
for uh you know equitable arena

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:03.829
transactionally this is Canadian hockey

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:07.439
politics you wouldn't understand

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:09.239
America slash all of the rest of the

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.489
world more or less because you're not as

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:13.079
privy to the issue specifically not

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:21.019
because of any lack of intellectual

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:21.019
capacity Potts going down easy here

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.050
got one more fight before the deal with

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.210
the devil this run's looking like it

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.270
could be fast the only thing is like we

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.950
need more things to buy cuz what's the

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.750
point having you know a lot of money

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.100
there's nothing to spend it on doesn't

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.750
really provide us with security if we

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.580
can't use it to buy basically at this

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.880
point things that really up our DPS is

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.000
that is the most important deal with the

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.150
angel holy water but you know what we're

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.170
still gonna fight and the reason is

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.150
because it's gonna give us more

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.370
opportunities in the future to get deals

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.630
with the angel and I want to we got so

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.730
many deal with the angel items to

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.540
potentially knock off the bucket list

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:10.460
here like anything that ups our

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.050
advantage there I think is fine do we

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.990
have three cent keys are they five cent

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.540
keys they're five cent keys so we're out

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.920
the good news is great head start for

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.630
the next floor full book a Belial charge

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.700
that by itself is worth something then

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.230
on top of that you can definitely buy a

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.640
key in an item we might be able to buy

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:32.300
two items if we get some money right off

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.390
the bat but that floor a little stinky

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.520
might as well take it it's more HP we

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.210
could if we get a sun card this becomes

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.210
even more valuable

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:48.190
probably just repeat of the last floor

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.280
here try this 10 cents or more please I

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:56.630
will say the secret rooms over time

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.490
probably pay for themselves now do we

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.590
want the luck upgrade or do we want just

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.050
the key I really think we will hunt just

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.640
the key we don't really like the 9-volt

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:09.980
either like where's my reroll machines

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:15.400
dude it's bookworm at least that's a

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:18.590
minor improvement I'm gonna go check the

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:21.440
special room the cursed room it's where

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.270
we found our second secret room got

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.110
three keys so I'm really glad we didn't

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.970
pay 15 cents now think to be honest too

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.620
I might just go one more floor buying

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.510
nothing and you're gonna like NL I'm

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.020
falling asleep it's the most boring run

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.750
of all time

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.370
look it's things that make fiscal sense

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.170
sometimes are boring but we'll be

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.219
falling out and drinking mojitos on the

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.560
coast of Key Largo

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:44.329
soon okay because I know one day we're

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.310
gonna find a floor and the floor is

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:47.810
gonna have amazing items that we want to

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.970
purchase or it's gonna have the means to

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.009
find amazing items by way of a reroll

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.269
machine as of right now they're giving

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:55.930
us nickels they're giving us dimes

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:58.279
they're giving us nothing to spend it on

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.779
what am I saying in a bind nine-volt we

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:01.550
don't need it we just don't need it

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:03.230
we're only using one book of belial

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:07.910
charge per floor right now they're

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:09.709
giving us you know latchkey pay five

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.660
cents for a key five cents for a spear

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:12.709
at heart of five cents for what a lock

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.300
upgrade who cares

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:15.620
we don't have gimpy we can always go

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.620
back and get it if we get something like

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:23.600
that here but our from that we're just

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:27.529
kind of riding it out so I think we just

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.779
spend another floor what it comes down

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:31.220
to is that I mean the reroll is quite

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:33.860
good as well but when it comes down to

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.689
is I refuse to spend our money on

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.519
garbage because I believe that there are

00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:39.439
dreams coming around the corner that's

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:42.350
the spectrum the items run from garbage

00:09:39.439 --> 00:09:47.870
to dreams and we're full on garbage City

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:50.240
right now my apologies to add me too you

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.610
can gain solace in the fact you're gonna

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.439
style on us with Connor McDavid like

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:59.300
seven times a year for the next 20 years

00:09:54.439 --> 00:10:02.139
probably let me let me get in my cheap

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.139
shots now

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.360
I don't like fighting two enemies at

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.290
once Aereo

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.940
problem solved okay so we just again

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.019
deal with the angel would be nice we got

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.250
a better chance of a deal with the angel

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:21.600
or do we have a hundred percent chance

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.949
because it right now this is sixty two

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.730
point five you know what I bet it says a

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:30.980
hundred or rather 37.5 sixty two point

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.980
five once we actually press the button

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.040
that gives us the the deal with the

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.449
devil wave dude don't let this trick you

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.399
like our stats are great I don't know

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:48.110
why monstro - now is 20 times more HP

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:49.860
than they used to he ain't so bad ok

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.449
finally deal with the devil we got a

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.490
hundred and sixty two point five percent

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:57.060
so this makes me feel bad because on a

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.079
recent run I added up the deal with the

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.490
devil and the deal with the angel

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.899
percentage and said why do we have a

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.670
hundred and forty percent chance of

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:05.699
getting a deal and I realized now that

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.199
the top number just represents our odds

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:08.759
of getting a deal in general and the

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:10.470
bottom number represents our odds of it

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:12.089
being the angel deal specifically so now

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.269
I feel like an idiot especially because

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:20.100
I made that mistake you know five days

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:22.560
ago only now got the chance to notice

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.540
not my not my finest moment but a you

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.589
know it's better to know that you made a

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:30.000
mistake don't send me steam msgs Daniel

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:31.230
that one just said copper I don't know

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.480
what that means he's probably referring

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.649
to smash hit any game cup head but who

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.649
knows in today's modern era

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:45.060
so why am i doing this not actually

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.260
gonna take the second key piece I think

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.970
this is a good opportunity to use

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.070
perthro we're not fighting mega satan in

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:58.980
greed mode anyway dude I'm mad tempted

00:11:52.070 --> 00:12:00.480
to use book of Belial I'm not gonna but

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.250
there is a case for it because we could

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.320
fight an enemy in the room on which we

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:07.290
leave this floor and then we only got to

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.270
do like one full wave before we can

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.010
actually start or not even one full wave

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.959
just wait for the second wave to spawn

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.760
after pushing the button and all of a

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:16.800
sudden we got hook of Belial back and

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.839
probably like have the amount of time we

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.660
spend here but I'm gonna use per throw

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:24.810
here and we are we're geniuses cuz that

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.920
just is amazing so yeah that's like

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.570
without book of Belial now we have

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.450
thirteen point six seven damage it also

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:32.510
healed us fully so it turns out that low

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:36.360
percentage play worked out real nice

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:40.410
leave for us so head downwards please

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:46.970
through the gaping stoma do the gaping

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:50.010
stoma grandma momo did shears an actual

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.779
amazing item capable of making me forget

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.660
about the fact that we have book of

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:58.440
Belial which has been great shears is

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.640
just especially the BFF we have to there

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.610
was a time where we might not have had

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.610
to but we have to that's too good that's

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:07.890
very good as well I don't think we need

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:11.010
to reroll our stats yet you know we've

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:17.130
been saving up for floors poki go is

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:18.779
garbage here in green mode everything

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.730
else is unnecessary so I think we just

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:23.940
go check this out first see what we get

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.680
in black heart and bookable i'll you've

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.410
been lovely

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:30.329
sincerely instead though the shears are

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.730
so good and now it would have been good

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:35.130
to have had nine volt but so be it

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.300
the shears are so good because with BFF

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.890
they do an incredible amount of damage

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.490
we can also stack up multiple charges

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.930
less relevant for something like the

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:45.230
ultra greed fight but more relevant for

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.230
the waves

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.740
we actually gain something out of the

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:53.070
extra charges were earning now remember

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.180
we don't actually have a lot more

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.910
donations to make to our donation

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:04.720
machine so you feel free to spend to the

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:08.500
limit basically even if we can donate 5

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:13.420
cents every little thing is gonna be

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:14.740
alright I think we don't use the third

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.420
charge it would be nice to get car

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.089
battery just to emphasize this cuz like

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.620
dude car battery would be insanely good

00:14:19.089 --> 00:14:22.120
for helping us beat ultra greed as well

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.279
because we're we're gonna keep it super

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.890
armored activated it like all times but

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:34.240
I still think it's worth it

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:35.830
we're like battery baby it's charged

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.460
penny in this game or is it an anti

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:43.660
birth I can't remember made quite a lot

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:49.260
of money on this floor mr. Fred survived

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:51.990
for about a quarter of a second and

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.010
actually blood of the martyr is fine

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.720
alright so let's try to create some good

00:14:54.010 --> 00:15:00.870
stuff pay to play is not worth it we

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:03.850
don't need range what am I an actor

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.900
blood clot we don't need it is the thing

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.980
we'll probably spending way too much

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:13.330
money on these rerolls but okay I mean

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.920
that wins then we should just go spend

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.120
way too much money on rerolls but we got

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.550
a full health out of it which is

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.459
essentially like idiot proofing the the

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.900
final boss fights here so I'm pretty

00:15:20.459 --> 00:15:25.150
confident that we are gonna just

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.980
absolutely survive I was gonna say

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.709
Poupon in hindsight I don't think that's

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.480
necessarily guaranteed triple shot is

00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:35.020
debatable I will take it as I like it

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.940
but I'm taking it like cognizant with

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.760
the knowledge that it's probably not a

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.860
great selection for us but I'm gonna do

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.440
it anyway because I am an idiot

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.980
basically so do we have a bomb for sale

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.980
we do nots

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:54.819
how ironic I think that it take the

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:56.410
tears upgrade seems disproportionately

00:15:54.819 --> 00:15:58.059
useful right now battery baby

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.249
specifically what we asked for

00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:03.009
and taro cloth okay I mean taro cloth is

00:16:00.249 --> 00:16:06.490
not good with the Sun necessarily but

00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:07.329
you got a you got to give credit where

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.889
credit is due

00:16:07.329 --> 00:16:10.509
are we gonna hold two cards that's right

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:14.619
okay so we should have taken the lovers

00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:16.300
with us right so basically we're just

00:16:14.619 --> 00:16:20.290
looking for random batteries or even

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:26.889
random battery charges full batteries

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:28.480
are better but and the big problem with

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:30.339
triple-shot is the tears down so the

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.689
fact that we were able to compensate for

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:35.679
it real quickly is is a big thing for us

00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:38.129
plus all of the good items were

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:38.129
half-price

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:50.950
his shots are like they're too on point

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:54.110
man it's like he knows what we're doing

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.279
all right so this wave is done I think

00:16:54.110 --> 00:17:01.550
we should probably start to think about

00:16:55.279 --> 00:17:07.189
saving soon any money we can donate is

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:10.130
worth it it's a bit of a weird play but

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:12.980
we could always make like a third cheers

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:15.740
as soon as we press this button and then

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:20.089
pick this up it's not like we're gonna

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:27.319
fight Krampus again so consider this

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:28.880
that bad it's fine I can't even blow

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.590
that up let's save for now I mean I'm

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.059
not trying to rush through the run make

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:36.350
it like it so it finishes too quickly

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:38.540
but just nothing that interesting right

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.309
here where's our secret room didn't we

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.960
have x-ray goggles or am I losing it I

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:48.070
might be losing it oh no we got him we

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:51.020
got him look at you look at you good

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:54.710
also decent so we got like one more

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.720
floor and then the greed fight we might

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.650
want to slow our roll just make sure

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.260
that we're coming through in the clutch

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.470
here we got a secret room not very good

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.470
right now

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:07.610
dude they don't make guppy items anymore

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.270
apparently really wanted to hit that

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:15.400
tinted rock got a little unlucky um the

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.400
thing is like rotten baby is so nice

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:25.300
genius Ron babies like such a good item

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:28.890
for us gives us especially with 18

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.890
damage the Flies would be outrageous

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.149
if you're wondering if this is gonna be

00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:39.100
a short episode it seems like the answer

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:41.320
is probably gonna be on the side of yes

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.960
songs on the side of yes by Stevie

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:47.880
Wonder unfortunately that's the way the

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.880
cookie crumbles on this one however

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:54.090
don't forget it's the last Judas

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:56.529
greedier mode run ever get like a huge

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:59.860
leap up on the competition thanks to

00:18:56.529 --> 00:19:01.750
that book of Belial mind you have you

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.309
ever get hit once you die so I'm still

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.750
like I was really bad

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:11.230
still pretty proud of the way this is

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:14.500
going but certainly it wasn't guaranteed

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:18.100
the whole time I'm a little worried

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.230
about the ultra greed fight mostly like

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.450
what happens Skol exes

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:25.149
yeah pseudo stole axes mostly what

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:30.130
happens if we can't see our HP like

00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:34.299
right now but like I'm taking a few hits

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:36.130
here if I died right now I would

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:38.230
probably stop playing Isaac for the rest

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:41.070
of my natural life in my artificial life

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.070
who knows what happens

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:48.799
I just don't know what our HP looks low

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:51.500
this little dicey there okay okay okay

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:56.000
do we really would want nothing else I

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:58.009
think we can afford a seven cent mr.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.389
right there take a little extra HP as

00:19:58.009 --> 00:20:03.200
well just so we you know we've got a

00:19:59.389 --> 00:20:05.059
head start on using the Sun usually you

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.860
get a little extra for fighting you know

00:20:05.059 --> 00:20:12.049
greed to begin with we're if nearly full

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:13.669
HP so not too bad and but not too bad I

00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:15.919
mean like as close as possible to live

00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:18.529
to full we might be able to reach peak

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:19.909
donation here so what's like the 10 out

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:22.610
of 10 strategy for winning this round

00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:24.289
right now it's very simple get more

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:27.379
batteries that's exactly if the more

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:29.120
batteries we can get the faster this

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:32.450
fight will go as of right now we're

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.250
still kind of subject to the whim of you

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.809
know the super armor it's doing some

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:39.500
damage I wouldn't say it's doing a ton

00:20:35.809 --> 00:20:42.049
but it's not disrespectful you know

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.450
they're trying but if we really I think

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:46.159
we'll still reap the benefits of like an

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:52.039
economy of scale if we can get more and

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:53.779
more batteries there so I'd say you know

00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:58.850
probably call it as like roughly a

00:20:53.779 --> 00:21:00.139
quarter way done here we have taken some

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:04.190
hits but you know that's what the Sun

00:21:00.139 --> 00:21:06.799
card is there for to them Becky said

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:10.100
mash uncon you know that's not really a

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:11.840
good Bruce Springsteen baby little bone

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.840
that's a little bit better

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.490
sorry brute good in the day we sweat it

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:21.420
out on the streets of the

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:25.070
and dream I don't my every classic rock

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:27.630
impression is just mumbling

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:30.059
Springsteen's not a mumbler dude he's

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:35.600
got a he's got a message and he's

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:37.679
getting it out there most of the time

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:44.160
you know he's all about hiding on the

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:46.679
back streets there was a period it's

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.030
like a six month period where any time

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:49.620
anyone would mentioned Bruce Springsteen

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.240
had like yo but I know he's easy to

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.270
caricature but you gotta listen to

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.920
1975's classic album Born to Run it's

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.530
not just Thunder Road and born - what

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.270
runs got some all-time bangers tend to

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.070
have a new freeze that's pretty good on

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.630
the back streets it's just called back

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.370
streets it's amazing jungle land is like

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:08.250
one of the best classic rock songs in

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:13.860
all time referenced in that infamous

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:19.800
louis c.k bid on Conan seven tracks of

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:21.900
magic dude okay you can't just stand

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.309
still when he shoots two shots at you

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:30.750
anymore that's that's a young man's

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:35.220
luxury please we're gonna win but it's

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:37.110
going to be a little more touchy than it

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.470
probably should be the dude if you want

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:44.420
to give me like lights out basically on

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:47.400

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.490
good at this fight if we can always just

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:52.170
have you know a taro cloth son card

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.690
although I guess the taro cloth son card

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:57.840
is not really too too valuable here you

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.760

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.930

I was looking a little scary there for a

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:09.330

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:11.070
