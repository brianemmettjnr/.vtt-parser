##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.570
everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.720
please the binding - again forth plus

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.480
it's challenge time slow roll if I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.820
remember correctly Ludo Dorito tears and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.860
we're like if the shot speed is very

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.379
slow oh it's not even Ludo maybe we got

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.900
Ludo on our on our first attempt or

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:26.029
maybe I'm just mr. member age 83 7 ly pl

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.869
it's uh yet another mom only mom's only

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.640
don't think we have too much to worry

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.759
about here I mean our damage is a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.180
hundred our rate of fire is justifiably

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.250
like extremely terrible but everything

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.540
else on this run is extraordinarily good

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.920
this doesn't strike me as one of the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.780
ones that could have been difficult it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.920
writes me as if I'm being straight up

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.989
with y'all it strikes me as a one of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.940
those challenges that ends up making up

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
the first half of the video and then the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.820
second half of the video is something

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.710
else altogether

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.539
well another challenge it's not like I'm

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.640
going to do half Isaac and then by the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
way you know here's how I feel about

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.019
climate change that stuff takes place

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.420
within the Isaac episode and as a result

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.710
it doesn't need its own platform because

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.270
we've already got it covered

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.460
I am going to be a little aggressive

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.799
here kind of weird but I'm going to it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.830
actually worked to at least get

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.600
something but I'm gonna play that to get

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.130
above five cents predominantly so that I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.439
have the ability to get an arcade on the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.360
next floor hold up I get it could be an

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.720
important message in this tab not an

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.369
important message says thank you for

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.890
your Steam purchase the email just came

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.450
light it's true I occasionally purchase

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.079
things on the online marketplace known

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.509
as steam might strike you as collusion I

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.659
mean after all we do both work in the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.070
same industry Gabe and I I don't call

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.930
them gaben i call them Gabe because I'm

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.810
on a first-name basis not a first name

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.729
and first initial the last name sort of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.290
basis which i think is less familiar but

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.540
I've actually never met him in my life

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.119
which that part probably does not

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.979
surprise you um I'll tell you what we

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.000
got to luck let's start gambling on this

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.000
bad boy right here

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.410
range up is fine I don't care about our

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.780
money because we don't have keys right

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.220
now we need keys to get into the shop to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.570
spend our money on anything productive

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.890
in the first place so I don't really

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.450
care about picking up that other money

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.600
over there until we have keys I was kind

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.530
of hoping to get blood bag just in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.710
general it tends to be a smart idea to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.180
play oh my god it tends to be a smart

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.620
idea to play your blood banks

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.930
it's like eating your vegetables as a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.220
kid so I'm hopeful that we can get

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.350
something to happen there but honestly

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.420
if we don't we're still pretty much one

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.900
tapping like every enemy that exists in

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.760
the game what was everyone's vegetable

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.340
experience as a kid like I'm being

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.290
straight up with you I did not eat

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.990
enough of my vegetable to get all owned

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.720
up to it I think in many ways you know

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.700
some people and I'll kill myself amongst

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.830
this group when you get older you kind

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.140
of like rebel against your past self I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.730
used to be an extremely picky eater now

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.320
I'll eat basically anything I'll have

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.110
opinions on it as you can tell from

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.810
watching the NL SS but all that was so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.360
dumb but I will eat essentially anything

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.730
I didn't used to like soup to watery

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.180
rice it's just too many of the foods to

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.620
consume at once

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.920
wonder if we can no there's no secret

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.269
room there obviously or there maybe

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.920
we'll just look for a second secret room

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:37.410
instead and as a kid I really only liked

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.519
like five vegetables maximum potatoes I

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.750
know people are going to say potatoes

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.640
don't count potatoes count it's it's not

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.350
a starch it's literally a vegetable if I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.239
have to deal with people going oh well

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.700
you know the tomatoes technically a

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.170
vegetable than are technically a fruit I

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.970
should say that I'm going to you know

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.100
take credit where credit is due for at

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.100
least eating potatoes plus potatoes are

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.480
bad for you however historically they

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.760
were great for you I mean in today's

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.530
modern world we have no shortage of

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.150
opportunities to you know places to get

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.250
carbohydrates and vitamins from right

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.709
but back in the day at least this is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.330
what my biology professor told me one of

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.840
my biology professors in college said

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.340
that basically like a half tablespoon of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.680
butter and something like six or seven

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.850
potatoes a day in the medieval era gave

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.830
you all the nutrition

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.780
all twenty essential amino acids you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.610
could survive on that for a long time as

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.440
long as you ate the skin you can fact

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.940
check that I didn't fact check it live I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.710
just went wow this guy's got a job in

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.610
the industry and I don't so I believed

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.300
him but anyway long story short potatoes

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.430
of course they count corn carrots

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.020
cucumbers that actually might be it I

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.560
know you're going to say NL you forgot

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.550
lettuce no no lettuce not even on a

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.610
sandwich or an M burger I would go to

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.950
Subway I'd get like a turkey sandwich no

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.640
cheese I like cheese but I opted out of

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.040
the cheese on the sandwich no

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.570
ingredients except note like no toppings

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.280
except a little bit of mustard on top

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:11.940
that was like when I was 16 that was my

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:13.470
order there's no real reason to use here

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.120
right here we might again there's like

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.310
there's no real reason to stand around

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.650
either we got nothing to gain now I'll

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.440
leave basically anything but I gotta

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.210
admit is I wonder sometimes I'm not

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.550
ashamed of it on the internet everybody

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.630
six-foot-two right I I'm five foot ten

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.910
sometimes you know I can stretch it out

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.830
a little bit I'm not like five foot

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.660
eight and then I just say I'm five foot

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.600
tended to clutch numbers I'm five foot

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.950
ten probably around the average for my

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.390
age group maybe a little younger because

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.790
all these kids are you know drinking

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.560
Soylent as they grow up now I wonder you

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.670
think I could have hit like six foot I

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.580
think I could have been a professional

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.350
athlete if I ate more why why am I not

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.240
using IV bag here it could have been a

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.860
professional athlete perhaps if I had

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.150
consumed more vegetables as a kid you

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.000
got to wonder to what extent that

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.330
matters I'm pretty sure if you look at

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.070
like my caloric intake by the way I

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.910
don't blame my parents for this and I

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.380
don't mean to make this whole episode

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.990
about nutrition I'm trying to make it

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:16.380
funny I ate so many snacks and drank so

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.060
much fruit juice as a kid I think my

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.310
parents are from the era where their

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.840
parents they would wake up and be like I

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.920
don't like coffee is bad for you so I'll

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.410
just have like a coke

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.060
in the morning so they're like this is

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.410
where we're coming from here so I think

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.550
we've come a long way in three

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:35.740
generations is all I'm saying but

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:40.120
um careful um get in there that doesn't

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.830
bother me but yet long story short my

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.780
kids are going to eat vegetables I

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.690
eventually got all eat any vegetable now

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.760
there's a few I don't like I continue to

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.220
try to like mushrooms I just don't like

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.890
them one day perhaps I will there are

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.980
some days and some kinds of mushrooms

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.720
that I would never order them myself but

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.610
if they show up in the dish I'm like all

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.980
these mushrooms are not just palatable

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.810
they're good but for the most part not a

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.970
mushroom boy I got to admit maybe one

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:11.680
day but you know lettuce kale give me

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.850
some raw kale does not bother me you

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.430
know they say that nutrition is an

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.280
important part of child's upbringing I

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.490
grew up unlike concentrated mango juice

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.260
and tortilla chips so honestly I think I

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.110
turned out relatively well all things

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.570
considered but what my who knows maybe

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.580
it's a good thing you know the rock that

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.970
rock no the rock posted that video from

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.800
Vancouver and he said you know he played

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.200
a preseason game with the Calgary

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.580
Stampeders against the BC Lions he was

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.890
so excited to begin the first step of

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.830
his career and then two days later he

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:47.050
got cut with a terrible story right then

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.110
he said it was the best thing that never

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:52.060
happened to him and is like maybe having

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.150
a poor diet as a child is the best thing

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.260
that ever happened to me

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.000
because as a result of that I find

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.160
myself doing YouTube videos instead of

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.860
you know being like a third-string

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.720
starter in the National Lacrosse League

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.890
now look it's clear I don't understand

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.300
anything about lacrosse if you're

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.220
watching this in your professional or

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.050
semi-professional or aspiring lacrosse

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.460
player I'm not insulting you I'm just

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.440
saying I'm okay with where I'm at in

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:18.940
life and who knows that maybe McCain's

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.680
line of not quite sugar free unnatural

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.930
fruit juices where the were the reason

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.310
for that you know we'll never know

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.960
unless we get some kind of Ashton

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.490
Kutcher butterfly effect machine going

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.770
out but my kids are even broccoli I

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.180
don't think you have to desensitize or

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.690
wait the opposite I don't think I have

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.100
to sensitize your kids to eaten like you

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.010
know vegetables to get them to like it

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:42.130
because the first time I gave broccoli a

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.870
fair shake as an adult I was probably 19

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.440
and I ate it and I was like what do

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.839
people talk

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.699
well a Calise got a media problem

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:50.110
everyone's like you know I did George

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:52.899
Bush Senior

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:55.209
I will not Eve I he by the way man's got

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:58.600
a right he's an adult he can choose not

00:08:55.209 --> 00:09:01.660
to eat his broccoli if he wants at the

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.980
same time what's this dog talking about

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.990
broccoli it's delicious

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.800
laws was not just boiled to smithereens

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:10.600
it's a wonderful poo I'm not even

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.439
talking about you know beef broccoli or

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.939
something like that either way some

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:18.519
vegetables get a bad rap

00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:21.449
I still think kale gets a bad rap kales

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:23.589
just like firm lettuce in my mind

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:25.660
admittedly I'm from the west coast so

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:27.939
you know I'm opening myself up to all

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.250
sorts of like ooh can I get it can I get

00:09:27.939 --> 00:09:32.230
a kale salad and a 1.8 million dollar

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.149
two hundred square foot apartment please

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.639
I'm from the west coast sure okay you

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:38.860
got me guy I wish I was the true

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:41.680
Canadian who lived somewhere not on the

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.240
west coast so I can make smug jokes

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.089
about everybody else and the

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.410
something-something Tim Hortons back

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:50.949
woods I don't know we're getting

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:54.100
uncomfortable here and the point is kale

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:57.699
gets an unfair rap in the same way that

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.889
like you know soy milk and veganism

00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:02.709
stuff like that gets an unfair rap

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:04.540
people you might not like extol the

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:06.339
virtues of kale you find yourself not

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.040
liking it by association

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.480
that's petty you're becoming that what

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:15.160
you hate in that situation I encourage

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.300
you to try some that being said I am a

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.279
hypocrite still don't really like

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.689
cauliflower I've learned how to

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:22.959
pronounce it after many years on the

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:25.839
internet but I'm stant shake the specter

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:29.529
of cauliflower just being white broccoli

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:30.880
and like it did something about it I'm

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:32.860
just like just give me the unbleached

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.269
broccoli I know it's not what it is

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:40.720
they're both in the Brassica family but

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:43.809
it's just not for me it's broccoli but

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.459
worse which maybe that's exactly how you

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:48.759
feel about Kayla's lettuce foot worse

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:53.130
but come on dude get some vitamin K

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:57.149
they're rich leafy green a point is

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.149
vegetables I don't know dude

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.740
probably something better left to a

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.779
nutritionist to talk about I think

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:07.139
that's a fair assessment I'm not a

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:08.610
nutritionist I'm a nutrition nut the JV

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:12.779
lirik does not work there

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:16.139
I tried but not bad just nonsense of

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:19.680
nonsensical so this is our tenth

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:20.670
challenge and I'm really just pulling a

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.320
number out of my butt

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.240
but I think it's around there I would

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.740
put us about half ways and we haven't

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.660
completed them all some that we failed

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.160
on three of them I think that would put

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.050
us about halfway through the rebirth

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.079
challenges which is nice you know we

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.610
might at some point take a break from

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:37.050
the challenges to do some more normal

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.180
runs that keep in mind we got to do 31

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.860
Daly's at some point as well we could

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.690
just load those up in the background and

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.279
like turn them off as soon as we start

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.779
them not really something I'm interested

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:47.870
in doing I'd rather do them all on

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:52.380
camera if I'm gonna you know cheese it

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:54.149
again it's I'm taking a very Dormammu

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.010
ish approach to this like I'm not

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:57.889
concerned about the amount of time it

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.959
takes us to get to a million percent

00:11:57.889 --> 00:12:04.260
nearly no one even if it takes us two

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:07.140
years it takes us two years you know

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.880
these Isaac episodes or the Isaac

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.800
episodes at this point have become like

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.810
a I don't know what else to record let's

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.800
record a bunch of Isaac you know take a

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:18.660
day revisit an old friend there's

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.790
certainly the games that allow me to go

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.350
most on the tangents for which I think

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.300
you know my commentary is most well

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.910
suited to a lot of people still enjoy

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.640
watching so you enjoy watching them I

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:33.600
enjoy making them dude kind of my slice

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.370
of life I also think like Isaac provides

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.230
a very important outlook for me or

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.470
outlet I should say for me in my life

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.449
right now and and that outlet is

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:45.060
appearing to be good at a video game I'm

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:47.190
not even being sarcastic but and and

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.019
allowing an opportunity to be myself or

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.449
at least a slightly less exaggerated

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:53.699
version of myself cuz on the N LSS I'm

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:55.860
always like you know oh hey Nick would

00:12:53.699 --> 00:12:57.540
you put the cheese on the top of the

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.320
sandwich and then the bread or do you

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.760
put it below the meat and then

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.650
you know the meat on top of the cheese

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.780
and then the old dad's crazy what are

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.160
you will moron or something so yeah I

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.410
recognized you know I'm playing a little

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.820
bit of a character there uh and I mean

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.200
I'm just going to pop algae's Versailles

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.710
Emperor to be honest because we're about

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.140
to win it's not exhausting that's like

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.990
my favorite content to make I love the

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.340
collaborative stuff and the tangents we

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.170
can get into but the personality's

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.210
playing off of one another on the NL SS

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.650
but it's also nice to just be laid back

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.120
and you know consider multiple

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:31.180
viewpoints without the pressure of

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.800
having to you know fit that mold I

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.630
suppose and Isaac does a good job of

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.580
that plus as compared to Kerbal space

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:41.020
program I like actually know what I'm

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:42.580
doing so it's a nice opportunity for me

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:47.410
to actually feel like I'm good at video

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:48.880
games root we don't need to do boss rush

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.030
that's apparent at some point you might

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.650
choose to do boss rush for fun but those

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.040
are not the that's not the right

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:59.740
opportunity to do that need some oh oh

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.750
my tomo buddy you're like Pavlovian

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.000
condition here and it's annoying but

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.680
also very sweet when you move some mugs

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.470
out of the way so you can come on up

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.260
this cat used to come in here sleep in

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.780
his box he loved life now he comes in

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:16.330
here and just meows and meows and meows

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.730
until I pet him and he never gets over

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.890
it that was 15 actually computer-savvy

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.780
is also extremely easy I believe I don't

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:26.620
know why I said Savi so weird this is

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:29.980
like the all technology run Plus homing

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:33.910
tiers so we're like extraordinarily

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.650
strong and this one also only goes to

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.860
Mom's foot so we're like sitting

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:40.570
unbelievably pretty right now spirit

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.500
hearts yeah let's mix it up you know

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:46.660
take curse of the tower why not now of

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.720
course I made fun of my Tomo buddy my

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:52.390
pride and joy and then we just hanging

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.800
out he's just sleeping in his box first

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.130
off don't ever make me look like an

00:14:53.800 --> 00:15:00.460
idiot again okay Tomo it's on undeserved

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:03.910
and uncalled for secondly who's a good

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:07.040
Tomo buddy he's looking at me he knows

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:12.949
he's the good Tomo buddy

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:14.600
I bring up the the height thing not

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:15.800
because I'm like paranoid about it but

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.709
height is like a weird thing on the

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:22.310
internet I think I just missed it I

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:24.410
always see people on Twitter calling

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.839
other people like manly and I oh you

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.940
know you're oh look at this guy he's

00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:31.670
like a 5 foot 11 man lid and I'm like

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.350
what is everybody online like Leif

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:37.339
Eriksson or something like that they're

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:39.259
all like seven foot four like but from

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:41.839
an evolution standpoint one of the very

00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:43.819
few things I'm even marginally qualified

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:46.339
to talk about it's really that and then

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:48.230
like overloading operators in C++ that

00:15:46.339 --> 00:15:52.459
is the only stuff in my wheelhouse but

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:54.829
anyway evolutionarily we haven't evolved

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:56.779
in the past like you know 300 years to

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:59.360
get that much taller just doesn't work

00:15:56.779 --> 00:16:01.670
on that speed due to the fact that human

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.319
beings largely are reproducing like once

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.959
every 20 minutes like bacteria but

00:16:03.319 --> 00:16:10.490
anyway some of us you know some of us

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:12.290
are some of the sign empress world world

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.519
cards worth it and we'll take empress

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.380
with us as well

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:17.569
we should have just used bombs to get

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.449
into the secret room but again this

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:22.760
one's super easy so it must be like in

00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:27.529
them again not a scientist but it must

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:29.389
be diet based you know your grandma you

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:31.760
know she's 4 foot 11 or something like

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:33.500
that right you grow to be six foot four

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.490
you think you you ain't got your

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.980
grandma's genes and they're

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:41.360
statistically you're like 12.5% grandma

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:43.370
not too weird you out maybe 25% grandma

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.449
it's been a while since I did the Gregor

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:50.329
Mendel you know punnett squares anyway

00:16:46.449 --> 00:16:53.029
the point is you've been eatin some good

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:54.560
stuff lately man you got imagine like

00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:56.000
some days I don't know if you guys get

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.829
this some days if I've been eating like

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.779
maybe a little bit too much fast food

00:16:57.829 --> 00:17:03.290
when this happens a lot of that packs I

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:05.600
I get the feeling of being like not just

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.250
hungry but like malnourished I know

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.740
you're gonna say NL is a hangover

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.069
no no I'm aware of been through college

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.959
I know what a hangover is this is like

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:17.540
four days of not treating your body too

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:19.580
well you just get this weird like subtle

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:22.340
craving for vitamins like

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:25.130
like I'll have three glasses of water

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:27.110
and can you bring out like a salad and a

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.490
can of beans and then that's like all I

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:32.720
want right now and like two

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:34.210
multivitamins anyway so that happens as

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.450
like no consequence

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:40.250
long-term imagine being sold

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.570
not even malnourished necessarily that's

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.630
probably a loaded term but imagine

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.800
having like the kind of nutrition that

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.450
was actually like all your genes were

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.550
like you could get to like six feet but

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.940
because you know you grew up in the Dust

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:55.730
Bowl you're eating like you know I had a

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.620
lettuce a handful of salt in a pot of

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.820
soup yeah that's called like lettuce

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.610
bisque or something like that

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.680
it cuts like eight inches off your

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:07.340
height that's we've got to remember dude

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.780
like we live in interesting times I

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.550
don't think there's like any question

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.590
about that and as men it's like a little

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.270
bit of a I'm not going to say a

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:17.210
backhanded compliment because it's

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:20.360
really meant as an insult but anyway we

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.490
live in interesting times but on an

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.850
individual level most of us have still

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:28.880
got it pretty good I guess

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:30.530
they didn't even know either in fact

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.170
they're like oh thank God I got to you

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.760
know eat six potatoes and a pad of

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.310
butter today I get all 20 essential

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.920
amino acids 50 years later you're like

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.570
oh that explains why I'm you know five

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.370
foot tall soaking wet that's not how you

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.380
use that expression for anyone it's

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.910
interesting is all I'm all I'm saying

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:50.170
how environmental factors play into

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.170
physiology like that

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:59.530
brings me out to because I'm like I'm

00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:01.900
old enough to not be part of the young

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:06.220
generation Daniels a semi a message on

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.690
Steam said Stadium status he's right but

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.429
I'm old enough to not be part of the

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.780
younger generation the up and comers I

00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:13.900
wouldn't doubt that for a second I'm not

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:16.809
trying to say like you know at 28 I'm a

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.670
young man and you might say well my

00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:20.740
grandma calls me young man and I'm 16

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.120
she's making funny oh you're such a

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.070
handsome young man she's being

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.809
patronizing you're still a child not in

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.130
like an offensive way I'm just enjoy

00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:31.960
your youth wild lass

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:37.390
I am a man who was young very subtle

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:41.080
difference but the younger generation

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:43.420
sometimes I go outside it's like the

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.670
average 13 year old child is like my

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.250
height or taller it's very disconcerting

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.690
I feel like I'm being I feel like that

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.700
like it jerks

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.770
senator from the x-men movie who's like

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.090
you know he sees one mutant shoot

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.290
lightning bolts out of his hands and

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.640
then he goes oh we can't have that I

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.920
can't shoot lightning bolts out of my

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.780
hands and then magneto puts them in the

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.179
weird machine and he gets turned into a

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:09.760
melt man you know we've all been there

00:20:04.179 --> 00:20:12.760
too who would really the Guster thank

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.500
you well this is like an extremely easy

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:20.470
run then I should not have popped that

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:23.920
right there but all right but you know

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:27.160
what more power to you because I went to

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.020
college still under the illusion that

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.240
there were jobs waiting for me and my

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:34.030
cohorts when we left if you're going to

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.260
college now at the age of 17 like you

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.550
just got the knowledge that it's all

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.500
sort of messed up and you're fighting

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.970
for yourself right we add the guinnesses

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.550
I'm saying this was a positive of our

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:45.640
generation we had the we had the

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:49.720
illusion we still had the like oh well

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.970
you know hey nice major leo tolstoy I

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.800
enjoy working at Starbucks but now I

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.630
think it's kind of shifted and they're

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.220
like whoa dude you got a job at

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.620
Starbucks work there until you die

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.270
because we don't know what's what's up

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.660
right now

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:06.580
plus they give you benefits so like ride

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:10.690
that train as long as you can

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:12.040
we're in this together right every

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.670
generations got their own thing as

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.590
opposed mostly I don't know maybe maybe

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.350
my generation hasn't even had its thing

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.730
yet that's the thing what was the thing

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.530
for my parents generation I don't know

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.020
you're probably going to say the 1960s

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.309
you know psychedelic era screw you I'm

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.590
not that old leaving my parents were

00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:31.929
born in like 1940s they were hippies in

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:36.640
the summer love my son they're

00:21:31.929 --> 00:21:39.160
relatively spry early 50s represent my

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.780
past him one day especially I didn't

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.360
think about the implications of that I

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:48.130
didn't think about the implications

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:50.440
moved a bit into deep loop as you

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.320
believe you look it's a me it's just

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.059
overkill by men at work saying we don't

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.320
know dude I hope I'm not here talking

00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:57.700
about like only a you know the

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.470
employment crisis is the biggest thing

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.200
to face my generation and then like in

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:04.150
eight years from now you know Elon Musk

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:08.049
is leaving humanity in a cyber war

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:09.190
against you know sentient machines or

00:22:08.049 --> 00:22:11.140
something like that I'm going to look

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:14.260
back on these comments and be like whoa

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:16.600
that was silly can't believe we were

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.820
worried about you know stagnating wages

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.470
when you know twenty years later we're

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.720
living in the sewers like mole rats

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:27.700
trying to fight back against t1000 who

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.549
knows Oh

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:33.429
I mean we're crushing it right now it's

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:35.049
not like we look I'm not even going to

00:22:33.429 --> 00:22:37.179
go pick up three cents on this challenge

00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:41.799
look at this this run is like beyond

00:22:37.179 --> 00:22:43.750
sick now you can accuse me of rushing it

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:45.610
a little bit here but we're about to

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.140
have finished two challenges over the

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.770
course of 22 minutes so I'll probably

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:52.179
like 24 by the time we finish so I don't

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.280
think we've really rushed too much we've

00:22:52.179 --> 00:22:57.130
just gotten probably the easiest

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.900
challenge in the game then like an

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.940
unbelievably strong version of

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.169
computer-savvy which is already really

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.169
strong in its own right so

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:13.500
yeah who knows dude basically that's my

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:17.100
my philosophy on things as who knows are

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:19.020
things that bad I don't know maybe I'm

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.150
kind of in a position where I can't tell

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.720
because for me I'm like how bad could it

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.299
be

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.460
there's Netflix is unlimited

00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:28.559
entertainment for $12 and then people on

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.770
Twitter are like we're dying out here

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:33.330
and I'm like okay but like the answers

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.059
complain about it so much I'm not

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.159
actually saying that but it fits the

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:43.250
joke archetype so I'm going to say it

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:48.210
anyway so yeah like maybe I don't know

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:50.460
it's possible anything's possible and

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:56.330
then beyond that impossible is nothing

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:59.880
that's the adidas slogan can I ask you a

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:03.000
question from one millennial to another

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:06.210
series of Millennials is it adidas or a

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.929
DDoS because I have said adidas my whole

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:12.330
life we said it on the show once and

00:24:09.929 --> 00:24:15.900
everyone laughed at me in Brazil perhaps

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.940
it's pronounced a DDoS I don't know feel

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.720
free to illuminate this for me I would

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:23.480
be eager to find out in the interim

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.980
period though because there's like a

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:29.539
backlog on Isaac episodes is actually

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.590
like shameful it makes me want to die

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:34.320
we're going to pick this up we've

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:36.450
already killed mom I some of this stuff

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.429
is good but there's like no reason

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:41.880
whatsoever to go for it

00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:46.020
all right I'll do it we'll lean is to

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.900
Kings we really lead is to Kings but I

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.130
mean I want you to know I'm doing this

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.500
this is me punching the clock

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:55.679
basically because like this run is

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:59.070
beyond out of control good and we also

00:24:55.679 --> 00:25:02.850
just won so we really the only thing we

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:05.970
can do by going on this run any longer

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.590
than we already have is ruin it that

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.330
being said it's going to be an easy

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.919
finish either way and did we only get to

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.610
do these challenges once we should enjoy

00:25:10.919 --> 00:25:14.250
the

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:24.420
you know the novelty of it well it lasts

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:27.090
I think you could just like somehow

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.250
provide for me a better series of items

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.110
that would be lovely I don't know how

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:34.040
you would ever do that at this stage of

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.040
the game but that's okay

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.850
you know the most uncertain thing about

00:25:38.049 --> 00:25:43.630
today's world man is like what's going

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:45.850
to be the next hot roguelite I guess

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.529
it's dead cells now you're gonna say

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.880
like whoa your backlog is long now I

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:51.519
haven't played dead cells in like two

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:55.480
months but then it did take the world by

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:58.330
storm for a while to do them I gotta

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.950
admit you know I'm happy for I've said

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.640
this so many times and its really

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.440
genuine

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.570
I'm happy for Eddie's working on other

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.600
stuff but there is also like a certain

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:10.029
lingering I wouldn't say emptiness but

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.700
like I'm kind of like when's the next

00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:16.120
week is the roguelite boon over because

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:18.909
I still love the genre the reason I love

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:21.039
the genre is because it's so accessible

00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:23.769
and I think it's really the easiest way

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:26.049
to describe it I love that you can play

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:27.429
a roguelike for nine hours and get a lot

00:26:26.049 --> 00:26:29.289
of emergent if it's good at least you

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:29.830
get a lot of emergent gameplay stories

00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:31.389
out of it

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.279
versus playing one game that is the

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:35.440
story programmed in for it in nine hours

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:37.539
you know if you're playing like a medium

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.549
length in the RPG or something like that

00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:40.870
they both have their place you know

00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:43.059
there's been so many great games this

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.710
year that I've I've enjoyed playing that

00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:48.490
are more narrative focused like West of

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:51.630
loathing and pyre etc etc I'm kind of

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:54.760
open the rogue lights are here to say

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:56.950
you know we the reality of the situation

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.350
though is that the genre or the the

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:02.679
industry does go through valleys and

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:05.320
peaks you know crafting games were

00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:07.929
enormous for a while still have an

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.460
impact of course for a while every

00:27:07.929 --> 00:27:13.149
triple-a game was a first-person shooter

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:15.519
it at least it felt like from like 2008

00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:17.350
to 2013 every triple-a game was a

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:19.090
first-person shooter or it was

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:22.389
assassin's creed those were the only

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.830
options that we had and then for

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:25.809
definitely for a couple years in the

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.610
indie game it definitely seemed like it

00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:28.539
was just road lights non-stop to the

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.159
point that people were starting to make

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:34.149
fun of them and I understand why but

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:36.639
hopefully it still has enough influence

00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:39.190
to stick around it's a mechanic I like

00:27:36.639 --> 00:27:41.200
doesn't fit every game oftentimes you

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.330
know you can use rogue light as a bit of

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.220
a shorthand for lazy design but when it

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:50.100
works it works that you can't deny it

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:52.470
and thank God Isaac was built like that

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.720
so we get robo-baby 2.0 allows like not

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.650
worth our time but it's done so thanks

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.580
for watching hope you guys enjoy the

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.940
episode if you didn't click the like

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.260
button

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.130
how's that a great deal and of course

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.080
subscribe you won't see more in the

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.540
future but for now thanks for watching

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.920
and I'll see you next time with probably

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.010
two more challenges statistically

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.010
speaking
