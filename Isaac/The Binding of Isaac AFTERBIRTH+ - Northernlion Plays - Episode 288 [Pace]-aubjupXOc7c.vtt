00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.110
everybody welcome Andrew the lion plays

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.520
a binding of issac a trick Plus onl

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.779
why's your streak at zero I thought you

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.460
had a good streak god I want to talk

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.460
about it I don't want to talk about the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.690
fact that maybe I had a run that seemed

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.070
like it started good except I have one

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.170
spirit hard and then a champion enemy

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.789
ran into me 45 milliseconds into him

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.869
nine angrily hit the stop recording

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.289
button on my computer because I'm a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.400
little baby zzzzz seven are get three

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.349
hopefully this run has been blessed by

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.240
Johnny gap of course he plays Captain

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.690
Jack Raven in the Pirates of the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.930
Caribbean franchise stance on this one

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.030
anyway like yeah I lost but I'm not

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
going to sweat it too much I don't want

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100
to derail my own narrative of actually

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.760
playing decently in Isaac lately but

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.710
steps on this one are modestly ok like

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.870
it says like a six and a half out of ten

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.469
we got acceptable speed which is really

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.539
speed is mostly like is it good or not

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.460
it's not like damage you know there's a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320
gradient who will our damage is okay but

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.300
we can use the tear effect immuno modify

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.180
in this direction it's more like can I

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.610
dodge enemies consistently 1.13 speed

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.500
probably puts us at that level space bar

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.930
items good HP is terrible but at least

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.369
you know for having only spirit arts at

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.310
least we have enough to weather the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.259
storm slightly here and damage is okay

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.360
although admittedly that's really nice

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.409
our rate of fire is pretty bad but the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.850
space bar item is pretty good

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:35.369
contributes to bookworm and leaves us in

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.380
a position in which I can hopefully I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.340
mean it already gave us a black card so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.329
I don't know what I'm complaining about

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.590
but hopefully pick up some good stuff

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.810
for now though it's all about getting

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.180
that first deal with the devil I it's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.259
been a little while actually that's not

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.670
true I was gonna say it's been a little

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.520
while since I had a super powerful run

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.560
it's actually been like maybe two runs

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.869
since I had whatever run gave us mega

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.259
that was like you know certainly less

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.750
than a week ago so it's not act like

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.250
it's absurd or anything at all give me a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.649
champion rag man

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.470
that okay I think it's a rag man who

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.500
does not summon spiders so there's like

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.500
some mercy on the game's end there

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.210
unless I mean presumably that will

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.120
become a spy oh but it becomes like a

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.100
lame spider this is a good champion rag

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.990
man dude we shoot the head to deal

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.850
damage but I actually want the spider to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.500
spawn or at least don't really care if

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.480
the spider spawns because each of the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.140
spiders takes two hits to kill oh what a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.610
shot

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.470
okay well I'll take the speed I'm not

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.350
super thrilled but 1.43 speed is

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.820
something I don't know HP upgrade from

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.720
our item room then give me a fight

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.890
against famine so we can pick up a Cuba

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.300
meat and I think we're off to the races

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.010
here good pail mom's a key actually like

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.560
a pretty terrible pill but I'll change

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.120
my tune pretty quickly if we're able to

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.459
pick up a tinted rock as a result of

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.459
this you got to go you got a go dude

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.200
okay one key now we're set all right so

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.670
just don't throw it away the sheep out

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.810
there watching these videos still think

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.790
you're good at Isaac wait is my

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.530
microphone on they think you're on an

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.330
upswing so all we got to do is hold it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.150
together just a little while longer

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.570
we'll be good here I really thought this

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.670
was a secret room access but shouldn't

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.040
be sadly we'll use a bomb to get a bomb

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.100
and also be able to shoot like six poops

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.750
here if you had just given me six poops

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.510
I never would have shot them but because

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.790
of the fact that these ones were hidden

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.040
I'm like in my head implicitly they're

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:01.100
worth more so one bomb for a pill and

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:04.310
and but and though is the thing one

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.020
sense okay not really worth the cost of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:13.160
doing business they're damaged up HP up

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:17.540
bread and butter God's flesh is good but

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.730
dangerous and I'm not talking about

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.620
foodborne illness Listeria Salmonella

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.420
etc etc is not a bacteria it's a

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.630
linguistical term that means and so on

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:36.200
but you know what I mean I'm talking

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.090
about running into enemies that are

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.640
champions and then hurt us or that do

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.590
contact damage and hurt us but do they

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.490
do contact damage if they're small I

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.900
can't recall we I mean we got enough

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:55.550
bombs we can look for a secret room and

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:58.400
this is great although also sort of

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.850
scary start to mil amount you all as

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.850
your bed

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.419
come on spiders come on spiders come on

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.419
spiders

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:24.309
let's go dude for real though thank you

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:27.009
the gods on Zeus you might as well I'm

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:31.240
just too on Sue's flank route to Gaza

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.249
hoggle eyes and then a year of room okay

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.919
well the next thing you do is use a bomb

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:38.229
here hope for money or directly spirit

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.939
arts would also okay sweet alright so

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.740
then we go into our shop inside our shop

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:45.849
there's no spirit heart for sale are you

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:49.089
kidding me okay so then you save your

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.509
bomb to get you out of a jam here

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:54.870
against your against your boss as much

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:57.490
as I wish that that weren't the case

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.819
seems like the best course of action

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:05.229
sadly and we try to keep the spider

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:11.580
honestly out of our business worked out

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:14.439
surprisingly well pin is actually like

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.659
my son so don't talk to me he's the

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:19.080
cutest boss and he's also look at that

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.830
face look at that little grumpy face ohh

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.469
somebody grew up because they're getting

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.509
murdered on the second floor as pin man

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.919
he's got a nice little Tomo face so it's

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.300
also a boss we shouldn't use a bomb

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.919
against because he could push it into us

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.580
and cause us some real problems

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:36.370
don't take this not yet anyway are you

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.319
kidding me first off that could have

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.459
murdered us never do that again

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:45.039
absolutely become to our Judas

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:47.800
absolutely do not pick up Guppies tail

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.509
but yeah become dark Judas which for

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.699
some reason manifests as a speed

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:58.110
downgrade but dude look at the damage is

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.110
the thing okay yeah

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.879
we're certainly far from out of the

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:08.289
woods but honestly second to maybe nine

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:09.879
lives or Avedon Jew dark judas was

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.349
probably like the best we could have

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.860
done in that deal with the devil so we

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:16.629
should be extremely stoked you know

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.729
we're a 10 damage on the third floor

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:20.889
that's awesome now the cost is that we

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:24.610
are also add to demon hearts and that's

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:26.169
it so you know there are some enemies of

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.580
my some enemies I mean literally one

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:29.740
enemy in the game that could kill us in

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.719
one hit so hopefully this whole floor is

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.580
not made of that guy because he's a real

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:35.139
jerk as far as I'm concerned I would

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.120
even call him a jerk ass and I don't

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.139
like to swear because sometimes that

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.940
means that Pepsi doesn't want to

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:41.349
advertise in my videos anymore but I'm

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.840
going to say it he's a jerk ass he

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:45.819
warrants a swear word of that magnitude

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.069
how do jump is a good defensive item but

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.659
I don't think I have the cerebral

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:52.900
capabilities to use it or at least have

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:54.520
not smart move dedicated myself to the

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.439
to the art of using it and as a result

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.719
I'm going to choose not to

00:07:56.439 --> 00:08:00.490
I feel pretty dumb about taking damage

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:03.900
against an enemy we never should have

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:11.379
taken damage against so I'm going to

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:13.150
endeavor to make up for it by not taking

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:15.659
any more damage on this floor or we'll

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.919
be dead so let's stay away from that

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:19.449
just do one little small room here

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:21.729
hopefully with enemies that do not do

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:31.930
one full heart of damage or spit bombs

00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:35.620
at us leave crack this crack this ace of

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:41.260
hearts tears up I mean it's good don't

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:42.729
get me wrong and we should be able to

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:48.490
keep these guys at bay pretty easily I

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:50.230
mean we're actually in a great spot the

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.470
stats on this run are out of control

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.959
right now the damage is so high relative

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:59.170
to what we'd normally be at I'm just

00:08:54.959 --> 00:09:01.899
very surprised and offended and honestly

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.500
I feel like a little persecuted that I

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:06.940
don't have a spirit hard right now

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.779
where's the nanny state when I need it

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.430
come on I stopped buying avocado toasts

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:15.750
where

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:17.550
my house and buy a house I mean spirit

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.890
heart okay this guy should I mean we're

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:23.839
getting so lucky that we're fighting the

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:26.279
world's easiest bosses over and over and

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:28.110
this is a great option for us we don't

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:29.880
need stats so thank you for the spirit

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.920
hearts and we'll just move along we

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.110
should be in a great spot now but let's

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.250
just try not to hemorrhage HP to enemies

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:40.290
anymore you know we learned a valuable

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:42.209
lesson that I often times take damage on

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.270
that room I'm going to choose to forgive

00:09:42.209 --> 00:09:50.250
myself for that but we're going to move

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:53.399
along here and be better I love and I

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.920
know that this is I'm going to preface

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:58.440
this by saying I know that I am a

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.010
millennial when I make fun of Milani

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.360
it's actually making fun of the making

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.010
fun of Millennials because we're getting

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.500
dunked on by print mania which is

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:10.649
hilarious for other reasons but anyway

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.720
you know there was big article I guess

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:16.230
we just take this right away a big

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.700
article like a week ago I don't know if

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.890
it's a big article or just made the

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.310
round so it's not you know gussy it up

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.060
too much but the Australian billionaire

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.520
multi-millionaire at least he said like

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.860
if Millennials want to start buying a

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.980
home they should stop buying avocados

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.630
host and he's like well you see back in

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.680
my day when I was looking to buy my

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:39.750
first home I didn't buy avocado toast I

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:45.270
just ate cereal it saved me like $2 a

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:46.860
day and then you know if Millennials

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.930
these days want to buy a house stop

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.610
complaining and just start you know pull

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.750
yourself up by your bootstraps and then

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.470
of course it turned out later that he

00:10:51.750 --> 00:11:00.300
had received a $34,000 loan from his oh

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:01.950
hello a $34,000 loan from his family to

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.570
start his own business not that it's a

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.850
lot of money but at the same time

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.770
indicates she was given a leg up himself

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.870
has nothing to do with avocado toast to

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.700
me what Millennials spent $34,000 on

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:16.130
avocado toast in his life except for mr.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:21.500
Alec Todd Oh would you have a you have a

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:25.310
dossier Kate what's what's up mmm

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:30.050
not in the least really truly madly

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:31.190
deeply you should sort out food for

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:35.120
yourself and I'll be fine

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:36.380
I will eat dinner but I'm not hungry at

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.510
the present moment I'm recording a

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:45.640
binding of issac afterbirth video that

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.640
is going to take like another 35 minutes

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.310
go for it you know what give me a give

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:58.700
me one of whatever you think I would

00:11:52.310 --> 00:12:00.140
like look at that see the correlation

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:05.060
between not owning a home and eating

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:07.970
avocado grows one stronger let me get

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.550
some proof booth uncompromised here

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:15.230
again but what is the whole reason for

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:17.330
this story is I could watch people get

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.210
dunked on all day is anybody else in

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:22.640
this boat that I'd love watching people

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.310
get bad on solicited advice and then

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.350
later it comes out that you know they're

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.990
a victim of their own hubris and

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.700
thinking that they're a genius it's the

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:34.160
great it's the sweetest feeling in the

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:37.520
world it's better than a nitrile cold

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:41.839
brew it's better than a than a dirty

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.540
West Coast IPA I saw another one that

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:49.190
was like you know Millennials want to

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:51.800
buy a home they should stop stop going

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.830
out to the club and then the dude listed

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.950
like the expenses of going out to the

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.450
club I'm fairly anti Club I'm not anti

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.959
their existence but I don't like going

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.089
to him

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:05.690
this dude listed like the average cost

00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:07.100
of going to a club was like $300 a night

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.980
means like if you just don't go to a

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.740
club twice a week for a year that's a 5%

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.950
down payment on a $500,000 home are you

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:20.570
actually an idiot who's going down

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:23.540
spending 300 bucks twice a week or even

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:26.950
like once a lifetime at the club that's

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:30.800
madness it's like $20 parking $20 cover

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:33.559
$150 on drinks $15 the pregame you're

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.539
out of your mind old man that's absurd

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:39.629
you get the $2 bottle of wine at the

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:41.399
7-eleven you slam two of those before

00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:42.809
you go to the club you buy one drink so

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:46.829
it doesn't look suspicious and then

00:13:42.809 --> 00:13:48.119
parking please old man Millennials don't

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:51.209
drink and drive that's probably a

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:52.439
harmful attitude but I'm just saying you

00:13:51.209 --> 00:13:53.819
know he's inviting that kind of

00:13:52.439 --> 00:13:56.279
comparison as a result of his own

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:58.649
ignorance jumper cables

00:13:56.279 --> 00:14:01.399
bloody recharge kill enemies get charges

00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:06.299
that seems useful for me right here

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:08.009
maybe and I say this with love because

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:11.459
to some extent members of my own family

00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:15.419
fall into this camp maybe it'd be easier

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:17.669
to buy a home if 40 to 70 year olds

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:19.319
around the planet stopped buying homes

00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:20.519
as investments and then flipping them

00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:23.069
five years later because they got

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:25.469
nothing better to do the watch HGTV look

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:27.839
I know the property brothers their

00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:29.279
enhanced some charming boys I don't know

00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:30.899
the property for others but I'm familiar

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:34.639
with them and I know they're Canadian so

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:37.529
I support them explicitly regardless of

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:41.369
you know what they're doing and I do

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:43.409
mean explicitly however it's like stop

00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:45.359
telling our generation what to do you

00:14:43.409 --> 00:14:47.959
can't have it both ways you know we have

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:50.689
the same o Millennials stop buying

00:14:47.959 --> 00:14:52.949
brunch if you want to ever own a house

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:55.309
by the way could you come over here and

00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:57.929
please help me fix my computer the

00:14:55.309 --> 00:15:00.059
Croatian hacker says that you're going

00:14:57.929 --> 00:15:02.579
to delete my old photos if I don't send

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:04.859
them $300 in brick coin whatever that is

00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:10.649
you know we got to learn to work

00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:11.729
together here I admit is art for all the

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:13.139
things that you know I think our

00:15:11.729 --> 00:15:16.589
generation is great and are we a little

00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:20.369
image exposed I think so and I thing is

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:23.609
you know we're not a uniformed people

00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:25.949
you know there are there's Instagram

00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:27.959
celebrities who and this is the pot

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:31.229
calling the kettle black are a little

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:34.379
vapid and image obsessed and I think you

00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:36.389
know people coming up in this day and

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:40.499
age might think it's the norm to take

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:42.749
like you know $20,000 trips three times

00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:45.029
a year go down to Ibiza and clubs and

00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:46.559
spend you know $1500 just because you

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:47.330
can there's also a lot of people you

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:49.620
know

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:53.100
grinding it out with like master's

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:56.940
degrees working at Mexican restaurants

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:58.860
you know scraping together every cent

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.320
that they can possibly muster I'm taking

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:04.200
Guppies paw here by the way to be able

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.959
to eventually maybe own a home that's

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.910
worth or that's at least charging like

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:11.430
four times would it charge fifteen years

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.200
ago just because you know it's been

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.459
bought and sold ten times people put in

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.050
new carpets and then list it for a

00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:17.640
hundred and fifty thousand dollars over

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.760
what it was when they bought it we're

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.649
getting it's it's absurd man the

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.510
vilification has got to stop and we're

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:26.940
guilty of it too this is such like a

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:29.579
soapbox the episode I just wanted to

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.680
talk about toast and now I'm here I'm

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:33.180
bringing the generations together in the

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.540
binding of issac and the cats are going

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:39.269
please stop yelling but you know we're

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.740
guilty of it too we look down on the

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:42.329
older generation to some extent

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.910
technologically illiterate

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:47.490
you know environmentally destructive

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.709
that's all in the past man we've got to

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.750
work together mostly to borrow money

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:54.320
from the generation behind us so that we

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:57.839
can put a down payment on a home anyway

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.850
so I'm going to be reckless here I'm

00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:01.800
going to avocados oast it up like crazy

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:04.290
here we're going to see if you can't get

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:08.400
likes in robes or yeah I mean I'll take

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:10.620
experimental treatment that's a damage

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.740
and tears upgrade which is really

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:22.819
valuable we're not quite in a beautiful

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:22.819
spot yet but we're doing pretty well

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.270
and that goes for our generation is no I

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.550
don't know what I'm talking about

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:38.020
effectively I don't know I feel like

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.020
Internet's become like a angrier place

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:44.660
catalyzed by you know political

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.310
differences especially but I think back

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.100
and this is nostalgia speaking I think

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.840
back to like the Internet of 2012 and

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.480
I'm like oh everything was so nice back

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.780
then I got to play a video game Wow cool

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.730
I also like video games me too you know

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.190
and now it's like I had to play a video

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.320
game don't play that video game the

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.360
artist made a tweet one time that said

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.190
that McDonald's is better than Burger

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.500
King and you're like oh man

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.510
I don't know I just thought I would it's

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:15.010
got pretty good scores yeah the media is

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:18.200
bought and paid for though I don't like

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:20.030
is social media like the worst thing

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.780
that's happened to the world in our

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.700
history

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.860
I don't know cuz on the one hand yeah

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.920
definitely but like on the other hand I

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.870
got to post a screenshot of me winning

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.590
so low match your players on known

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.020
battleground

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.140
so I'd say like that's pretty much a

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:38.360
wash like I'm not trying to say that I

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:41.990
fully negated all the annoying parts of

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.550
social media via my actions but I mean

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.900
unless you're disagreeing with me I'm

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.790
just going to kind of float that one

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:50.840
over on plate and you can smack it on

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:52.130
yourself Tom well I got to be honest

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.380
with you you're really abusing the

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.360
in-and-out privileges of this parking

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.030
lot

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.280
you got a-you know choose your spot you

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:05.540
sleep 16 hours a day do you really need

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:12.230
to move every two hours between rooms

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:14.090
just to try to make it happen if you

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:16.340
okay you're pawing the door that's

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.650
pathetic and cute there you go have some

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.630
have some access to the outside world

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.070
Ruka you're going to stay with me you're

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.540
going to stay and watch me not squander

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.630
this run thanks buddy

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:31.450
let's go okay did we go to our item room

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:34.970
on this floor I actually can't recall

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.950
mom's pearls is like theis and I would

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:40.100
like another spear at art

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.330
I got like so off-track I'm just going

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.780
to go down to the next floor this floor

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:51.860
was fine but I got so off track here I

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:53.660
got off on a cross-generational wormhole

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:59.660
and I don't even understand the freaking

00:19:53.660 --> 00:20:01.040
half of man I don't know though cuz I

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.230
don't really know what generation I'm a

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.640
part of I know I'm a millennial I drink

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:08.660
cold brew coffee so that's pretty much

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:11.750
indisputable and I like weird beers

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.370
instead of you know whatever half of the

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.220
days when a beer was just a beer now

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:18.820
it's not have an imperial Radler hold

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:26.150
the grapefruit peel please am i right

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:28.040
but at the same time I also buy a fabric

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.780
softener and I have shopped in a

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.280
department store before which I think

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.320
makes me almost like a millennial

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.360
unicorn or some things I hear that our

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.360
generation is kill in those industries

00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:48.019
which is I don't know I'm trying to

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.360
think about how I feel about that I

00:20:48.019 --> 00:20:53.029
don't understand the purpose of fabric

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:55.669
softener I buy it I'll tell you the

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:57.799
reason the purpose of me buying it my

00:20:55.669 --> 00:21:01.519
wife tells me to buy a fabric softener

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:03.200
so I go to the store and when I don't go

00:21:01.519 --> 00:21:05.749
to the store to buy fabric softener come

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.519
on I mean I'm my own man here but if I'm

00:21:05.749 --> 00:21:09.019
at the store and we're out of fabric

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:10.489
softener I'll pick some up I'm not going

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:13.429
to make a special trip because I mean

00:21:10.489 --> 00:21:15.350
I'm an autonomous man who I wear the

00:21:13.429 --> 00:21:20.119
pants in this really fun at the store I

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:21.980
will pick up fabric softener if we need

00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:24.830
it and only if we need it because I'm a

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.019
man who makes my own decisions but you

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.850
might be saying do you guys stand up for

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:31.039
yourself you don't understand why you're

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:35.179
using fabric softener you got to stand

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:39.109
up for yourself maybe you're right but

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:42.049
honestly what a fabric softener is like

00:21:39.109 --> 00:21:45.019
the reason I love laundered clothes and

00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:46.580
I just don't know it like maybe we're

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:48.409
getting down a slippery slope at first

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.080
I'm like oh I don't need fabric softener

00:21:48.409 --> 00:21:52.759
anymore then I'm gonna start the

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.179
question everything maybe we don't need

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:57.950
dryer sheets maybe we don't even need

00:21:56.179 --> 00:21:59.960
detergent just throw in all your clothes

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.249
and a bar of frickin zest or something

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.749
like that we might be able to make boss

00:22:01.249 --> 00:22:04.669
rush we might as well give it a shot

00:22:02.749 --> 00:22:08.509
grab it go go go go go let's do it let's

00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:12.769
do it we got 19 damage let's go I can't

00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:15.169
believe we made it actually and I don't

00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:17.269
really want to do it not for that anyway

00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:18.889
did we go to our item room there am I

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:21.649
just I don't know I feel like I'm

00:22:18.889 --> 00:22:23.899
completely off the rails here we didn't

00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:25.149
go to our item room there we probably

00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:27.739
skip to item rooms on this floor

00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:31.460
commenters I throw myself on the mercy

00:22:27.739 --> 00:22:33.259
of the court okay I saw my shot and I

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.210
took it I took a three-pointer when we

00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:37.249
were down by one it was a bad decision

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.230
and you know what coach is going to yell

00:22:37.249 --> 00:22:42.259
at me on the bench it's up to us to keep

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:45.350
you know our play strong and snag the W

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:47.239
here so you know that we're not we don't

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.360
want to let the sports metaphors who's

00:22:47.239 --> 00:22:51.049
the thing

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.850
turn us down here secret room thank you

00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:55.860
I've focused too much on the commentary

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:58.320
here not enough on the gameplay

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.820
well all I'm trying to say is first that

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.960
came for the fabric softener and I

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.419
didn't say anything cuz I don't buy

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.559
downy and then they came from the dryer

00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:07.380
sheets that I didn't say anything

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:09.120
because I'm not working at bounce these

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.779
are probably all subsidiaries of Procter

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:18.169
&amp; Gamble aren't they and then when they

00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:21.230
came for the detergent who was less

00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:24.690
nobody pretty soon we're all gonna be

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:26.190
washing our clothes on the freakin you

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.440
know the things they use if you got a

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:31.610
band with spoons and like a jug in it I

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.610
think it's just called a washboard

00:23:32.419 --> 00:23:38.820
probably one of the most underrated

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:40.649
instruments you go down to the grad club

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.260
Thursday nights the washboard and

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:46.620
theremin open mic it's a classic dude

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:51.360
I'll be there on the spoons Kate's on

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:54.659
the jug it sounded like almost lewd but

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.490
wasn't so I'll accept that this run is

00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:58.169
like the antithesis of some of the runs

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.809
we've had over the course of today a

00:23:58.169 --> 00:24:02.610
little bit earlier like today was the

00:24:00.809 --> 00:24:05.450
day I recorded that one it probably went

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:09.000
up yesterday where we had like no speed

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:10.590
but got crazy strong and then like the

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.510
final three floors were beat in like two

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:18.090
minutes this one is like a little less

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:23.610
certain that we're going to be okay doo

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:25.830
doo doo doo Just Dance but it's a very

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.149
strong in its own right it's a couple of

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.159
more spirit arts I feel like we've been

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:32.870
like spirit hearts starved over the

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:34.830
course of this entire run quite a lot

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:36.750
you know I'm thinking there's got to be

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:40.590
a 10 - Drock hidden somewhere probably

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:42.480
under the fabric softener and guppies

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.549
head is doing an incredible work for us

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.590
but it's just not doing it enough

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:48.870
because we're only given three flies per

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:51.049
room we needed this wire coat hanger and

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.049
then

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.300
we have Dudley's head I think we take it

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:04.910
traving one HP for a 50% chance to come

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:08.420
back from the dead and the guppy chance

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:10.130
seems like a smart call to me I think I

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:14.630
might just use the emperor card but it

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:16.370
depends it's a lot better to use the

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:19.100
emperor card to escape the clutches of

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:25.010
the Cathedral because it's a little bit

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:32.240
more difficult for one a lot of battery

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:33.470
charges if in theory I forgot me a

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.570
jumper cable that's why we're getting

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:38.630
the the extra Guppies head charges on

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.890
occasion good item not sure if Guppies

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.150
head is really the best way to take

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.230
advantage of it because we get charges

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:47.450
for it so frequently anyway but

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:51.040
certainly I'm not Turner to my nose at

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.040
getting three extra flies on occasion

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.980
got a check you know even though we've

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.690
only got two bombs I would love to see

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:03.260
if this is like that you're upon it is

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:08.570
the hero font let's all go for a walk

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:12.170
outside man sama Center continues to be

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:13.820
easy money oh dude my CI think I'm a

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.640
pretty disciplined person for the most

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.460
part you know especially discipline with

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.650
my diet what did I have for lunch I had

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.600
a double cheeseburger in an order of

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.030
animal style fries at a place in

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.470
Vancouver that is called Cali burger but

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.940
it's basically just in and out but they

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.470
definitely like do not have permission

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.550
to use the trademark so instead it's

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.770
called Cali burger

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.620
it was delicious my left arm started to

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:40.670
hurt a little bit during the meal I just

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:43.790
lean back a little bit 20 or 30 seconds

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.650
later good to go so as you can tell I'm

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:49.060
quite a disc that was a joke maybe a

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.060
tasteless joke for the joke nonetheless

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:53.480
that's one of those things you say and

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:55.220
then you're like man I hope I don't die

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.450
of a heart attack the day this video

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.370
goes up because those are going to be

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.450
that's going to be irony I don't want my

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.940
death to be ironic

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:10.880
I just wanted could be you know a

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:12.409
national holiday let's go so as you can

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.350
tell I lead a disciplined life but I

00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:17.539
never wanted to use the emperor card

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.280
more than when I find a dead end even

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:21.950
though we've already explored like 70%

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.120
of the floor we should be good here I

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.130
don't think we took damage at all on

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:31.309
that floor so that's great news what we

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:32.840
will do is impaired or and clearly the

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:35.090
odds of us becoming guffy are

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.880
effectively zero now by the way did you

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.020
notice big chubby block shops probably

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.520
like the tenth time I've had that

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:44.080
revelation over the course of these

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:48.559
videos but that makes it like a weird

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:50.929
sort of interesting analog to the

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:53.659
shielded tears which are actually pretty

00:27:50.929 --> 00:27:55.580
viable for us against a boss that's more

00:27:53.659 --> 00:27:59.210
of a bullet Helly sort of experience

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:01.850
here I'm kind of into it now the chest

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:03.950
is I think setting itself up to be a

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:08.350
genuine challenge for us right now don't

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:08.350
even tell me with his void nonsense I

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:13.429
don't want to do it not not yet anyway

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.289
maybe if we get stacked on this floor we

00:28:13.429 --> 00:28:17.510
don't have great luck so I wouldn't

00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:19.309
necessarily expect the 8-inch nails it's

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:23.840
like a five damage up it's pretty good

00:28:19.309 --> 00:28:26.870
stem cells is nice ball of tar is what

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.169
it is and robo-baby 2.0 is damage that I

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:31.130
will probably like rarely notice but

00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:32.510
certainly I'm not going to say no to it

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.120
especially since we already picked it up

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:37.990
like you know almost a full minute ago

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.990
at this point probably

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:46.590
this run is turned out quite nicely

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.000
actually an instant it means there are a

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.620
couple of times we could have thrown it

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.080
but let's be honest on the difficulty

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.750
scale this is like a three it's not an

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:59.309
automatic win it's not like three HP and

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:59.610
Omega to start but dude look at me right

00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:01.669
now

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:04.620
we look like demonic Renly Baratheon

00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:08.669
from season two a game of Thrones we got

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:11.309
the stag crown that's about it but you

00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:14.490
got to admit maybe I've been a little

00:29:11.309 --> 00:29:17.190
too into that show play see I'm seeing

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.450
Renly Baratheon everywhere man he's my

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.879
favorite character I hope done that that

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.649
happens to him that's not a spoiler it's

00:29:20.879 --> 00:29:26.429
Game of Thrones something bad happens to

00:29:22.649 --> 00:29:29.669
everybody there's nobody on that show

00:29:26.429 --> 00:29:33.539
for whom you know the last six years of

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:36.090
episodes has done you know positives

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:37.559
with no possible losses to them we

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:42.509
should have killed that enemy last but

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:45.029
you know he was behind or he was in

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:45.480
front of the other enemy so made it kind

00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:48.570
of tricky

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:50.009
dude infamy thank you for saving me for

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.620
myself you couldn't have done it twice

00:29:50.009 --> 00:29:54.809
in a row I you know I accept that but

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:58.139
thank you for at least reminding me that

00:29:54.809 --> 00:30:02.399
you're a sweet item I appreciate you and

00:29:58.139 --> 00:30:04.379
I wish more people did doing the Lord's

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:08.580
work out here in for me keeping my runs

00:30:04.379 --> 00:30:14.159
alive when they may or may not deserve

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:15.210
to now you might say as been a while

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:17.879
since I watched season 2 have Game of

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:21.419
Thrones don't remember Renly Baratheon

00:30:17.879 --> 00:30:25.350
having a fetus attached to the side of

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:28.529
his head dude this your first time ever

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:31.309
watching HBO season you got to watch the

00:30:28.529 --> 00:30:36.149
deleted scenes there's a scene in which

00:30:31.309 --> 00:30:38.450
Natalie Dormer uses a scalpel to excise

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:41.460
the fetus from the side of his head is

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.750
pretty pivotal it was a big moment in

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.779
the books but they couldn't put it into

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:49.549
the show because of that FCC you know

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:49.549
it's all politics in this day and

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:58.390
let's go now that was probably like the

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.980
most time invested to get the least

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:03.220
valuable item at this point of the game

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.290
but not too worried about it

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:08.740
I'm just happy again we're getting some

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.660
momentum even if the canonical street is

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.610
not continuing because of a you know

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.700
hypothetical stupid loss that came

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:19.900
recently we're putting good episodes on

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:22.360
video and I'm thankful for it this was a

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.400
quick one too you know at 28 minutes to

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:29.170
be blue baby like that is that's a

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.460
no-joke pseudo like speedrun might be a

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.560
little bit of a stretch but you get the

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.390
idea

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.040
nothing to sneeze at and then the one

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.460
time I wanted void they don't give me

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.200
void

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.910
maybe if I say I wanted void I'll get

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.960
the credit for it without actually going

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.400
there but for now thanks for watching

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.510
hope you enjoyed the episode if you did
