00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.270
hey everybody welcome back to northern

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.330
land please abiding by suppose we define

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.910
on the last episode we got stuff done as

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.509
Cain we unlocked Abel

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.740
aka what a snooze we could do greedier

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.910
but we kind of got to make up the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.859
difference here you know what Eden

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.529
negative with the side of hush if

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.590
possible start with the coupon great

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:32.009
rate of fire my face is broken it's just

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.140
a mustache jsv 9 c 9 f 3 and paralysis

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.160
so how you do and there we go we get to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.579
move again this is tough right off the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.320
bed I love our stats by the way speed

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.120
even damage but especially rate of fire

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
are all up there as far as like

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.120
above-average stats go but the real

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.379
problem right now was the fact that I

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.270
had to give up a guppy item

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.829
I love Guppies head but the coupon as

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.420
much as I think that the coupon is a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.129
much worse item the Guppies head it's uh

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.809
arguably and I guess well you know the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.750
the facts will come to bear that here

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.700
hopefully arguably much better if you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890
get it a lot earlier so we got it super

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200
early we will take anti grab mostly just

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.650
to get this ridiculous dr. Manhattan

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.090
cosplay going well yeah you know if we

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.400
use coupon properly you could

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.810
conceivably give us a bunch of free

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.759
items it also works on deals with the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.320
devil it's a little bit more exciting

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.100
than guppy said Guppies head is like the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.869
item you settle for it's the item you go

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.960
well you know this runs approaching the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.790
end of its existence we're gonna need a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.020
little extra damage if not now than when

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.640
we get a bomb to start with I don't

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.560
think we want to reroll any of this yet

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.909
oh my god there was nothing a value

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
there that's annoying we might not get

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.409
another charge here but we got a you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.229
know keep an eye out regardless um if we

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.790
can get a couple of good let me put it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.829
this way you know this is like journey's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.689
don't stop believin our run has started

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.000
we're a small town girl living in a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.469
lonely world we want to take that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.299
midnight train anywhere we don't want to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.340
take the you know 9:00 a.m. into the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.440
city workin for the man every

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
they like a mix and metaphors here but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.500
the point is we're gonna bet on

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.060
potential instead of betting on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.349
certainty cuz certainty right now is

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.060
kind of boring potential could be

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.780
anything it could even be certainty

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.280
oh I dodge right into that that being

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.019
said the run is strong already

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.790
it doesn't need Guppies head to be

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.670
strong plus we got rod and baby which is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.220
kind of like a passive Guppies head sort

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.319
of torn photo probably wait a minute

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.989
never mind torn photo did do something

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.930
for us we have a ridiculously high rate

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.450
of fire like much higher than you would

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.069
ever expect for a first floor especially

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.110
with the amount of damage we got which

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.810
is you know above average in and of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.400
itself for floor one unlikely we're

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.069
gonna get another charge but I think we

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.209
have an obligation to ourselves to at

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.329
least take a look maybe we can get an

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.720
arcade as well only takes a second to

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.819
break all these poops so I had one of

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.319
those mornings like I woke up I pulled

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.610
something in my neck like right off the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.250
bat I don't know what it is about the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.440
human body but you know a neck strain is

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.209
like the worst pain at least the most

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.280
annoying pain cuz it's like a 1 out of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.380
10 but it's a 1 to 10 permanently like I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.019
I'm sitting all weird in my chair here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.480
my posture is all affected but I know

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.920
it's gonna be fine in like a day but I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.380
still can't help myself I'm trying to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.840
like grab my neck with the reverse nice

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.660
in the reverse steven seagal here and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.920
then you know twisted in the hopes that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.989
I don't know by wrenching my neck

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.900
violently in one direction it'll somehow

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.900
alleviate the pain seems unlikely

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:51.930
why yeah that's why I like it but if I

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.459
was designing humans step 1 no neck that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.560
sounds like a shot at my co-host it's

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.190
not intended to be I don't mean no

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.120
Nicolas I mean no neck the neck is just

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.739
it's just there to annoy you you might

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.690
say oh you know it allows you to turn

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.130
your head now we'll just put it on like

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.660
we'll just put your head in the center

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.419
of your chest then you can turn your

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.980
hips if you want to I ask bad damage we

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.090
need this deal with the devil thank God

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.590
we got the spirit art back there to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.070
begin with but we need this deal with

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.910
the devil

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.000
a lot of things I would change or I

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.740
would change I should say no tube in the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.380
human body would have two purposes every

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.820
tube would have one purpose it's the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.710
difference between an old-school

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.180
fountain drink and a coca-cola freestyle

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:39.630
machine well should it not use my bomb

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.850
but it's not like we didn't get a reward

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.810
out of it anyway I don't want more than

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.220
one fluid coming out of the same nozzle

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.540
if I was remaking the human body we'd

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.280
have different nozzles for different

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.460
fluids and for different purposes of all

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.960
variety you know when you drink the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.610
liquid goes down a different tube then

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.870
the food goes down which is the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.320
different tube than the air goes down

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.730
and you know you get the idea the

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.510
general gist of it at the very least

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:10.280
okay let's open this up we don't really

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.280
want any of this to be honest with you

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.340
we just don't

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.050
in fact we obviously in case it's not

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.170
abundantly clear we also do not want the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.550
item room item which is just Giga fart

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.910
or is that it no it's kidney bean though

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.950
the love tooths

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:32.880
we still need no no no no careful hole

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:36.470
we still need to get our deal with the

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.470
devil here we don't have to no

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.400
teleporting enemies I'm sorry I played

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.950
so bad but it's my neck owl it just it's

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.660
not doing very well right now I can't

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.010
even pretend to use that excuse

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:56.370
unfortunately I've been lucky I've never

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.520
had a bad back occasionally you know you

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.140
wake up a little weird tweak something

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.730
in my back and for like an hour it's you

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.600
what's out it not out of commission but

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.000
like not in a great spot but neck I

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.280
always I was like in my early teenage

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.080
years some days you just wake up wrong

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.620
and all of a sudden you got 24 hours of

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.620
looking like Quasimodo

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:23.070
well let's try this no secret room but

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.580
we did get the nickel we'll take these

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.259
we don't need compost like it might not

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.419
necessarily be bad

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.340
with rotten baby but coupon is cooler

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:39.560
now we could still get extraordinarily

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:42.889
lucky and get a deal with the devil we

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.139
didn't I I still don't think there's a

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.240
purpose to using coupon it would be

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.889
better if we could reroll our are the

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.939
contents of our shop but that's ok hello

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:57.909
Ruka please don't jump up my lap it'll

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:57.909
tweak my vestigial appendage here I

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.789
don't understand the purpose of a neck

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.090
there's just some parts of the human

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:06.409
body that I think like maybe it's just

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.000
cuz I've been watching too much Game of

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:10.400
Thrones but it feels like the neck is

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.870
just there to be cut off why don't we

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.610
just put the head somewhere that's a

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.069
little safer like your brain should be

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:19.550
like inside the earth you know your

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.629
chest cavity or something like that just

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.169
make it a little harder for the

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:26.629
executioner to get you same thing I

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.610
always will the neck in particular not

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:30.560
just for the you know attaching the head

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.719
to the body sort of deal but you know

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.610
you got a jugular vein right there as

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:36.080
well you could trip and fall catch it on

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:41.389
a rusty fence post or something like

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:44.330
that you're out of commission we gotta

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:46.370
we gotta embed that stuff you telling me

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.990
the appendix is you know sealed within

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:52.610
my thoracic cavity more or less my

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.659
jugular veins just hanging out my

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.279
femoral artery

00:07:53.659 --> 00:08:02.990
just waiting to get hit by a renegade

00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:05.029
skateboarder please big Warren dying

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.520
relatively quickly here is a pretty good

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:09.110
sign that our damage is amazing which to

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.449
be fair we already knew but still all

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.729
right sure we'll take a free mom's knife

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.469
does it ruin our Tears synergy yeah to

00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:16.669
some extent but I will always take the

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:18.740
opportunity to take mom's knife

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:21.020
especially you know early on in the game

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.800
here in the save I should say because

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.599
we've never actually or I shouldn't say

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.759
we've never seen it but we've seen it so

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:31.789
little that I certainly don't feel bad

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:34.599
about it mind you it does hamper the

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:37.399
synergy somewhat actually it's kind of

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:40.250
it's kind of bad our rate of fire has

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:41.430
extended our range so much early on that

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.020
it's actually kind of hard to hit

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.660
enemies but you know I think we'll find

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.470
a way to live with it as my guess you

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.930
know it would be like the perfect

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:52.740
amalgamation right now is like a quad

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:56.730
shot or a triple shot make it so we can

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.589
have like a faster ability to shoot

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.060
directly in front of us instead of way

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:03.120
off in the distance no no no we don't

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.529
really want that and also potentially

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.029
triple or quadruple the amount of damage

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:08.250
done so we don't really need that we

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:09.660
will still check this and I think infamy

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:15.480
in a dime that's top of the line is

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:18.779
probably worth it what we're really

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.390
looking for is like coupon restock or

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:22.910
something like that which sounds like

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.410
the name of a wide receiver in the NFL

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.870
you know now suiting up for the Kansas

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:31.440
City Chiefs coupon restock I could see

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.790
it you might think that sounds

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.140
ridiculous or even borderline offensive

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.140
I want you to remember there's a New

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.630
York Giants receiver weight pittsburgh

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:44.450
steelers receiver called ha ha Clinton

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:49.440
Dix so think before you speak

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:50.820
lest yak you acquiesce yourself sorry

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.940
for the bad joke it's just you know my

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.440
neck hurts so much I can't be I can't

00:09:52.940 --> 00:10:00.990
make head turning comedy when I can't

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:05.070
even turn my own head I have completely

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:06.630
forgotten what the backpack does extra

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.580
active item room that's right then with

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:14.670
control we can switch between them so

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:17.670
actually this is awesome because we can

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:22.830
use honorable mega MA sorry mama mega

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:24.270
can only be used on one floor does it

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.070
open I'm trying to think it definitely

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.810
opens the hush floor but we're gonna

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:31.100
make the hush fight already probably I

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.100
think you just use it right off the bed

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:36.500
finding the secret rooms pretty much

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.500
clear out the whole floor by itself

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:44.980
start generating charges can't get in

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.570
there yet thought I was gonna get hurt

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.980
there actually I'm gonna stick with the

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:52.780
monkey's paw I'm just a little bit

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:56.890
concerned about our potential HP

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:58.240
situation here but otherwise I think

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.740
we're in a good spot it would be nice to

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.970
be able to use megamom more frequently

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:09.460
but you know it is what it is

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:13.660
this is double paralysis GB bug I always

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:18.010
think that it's missing though and then

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:19.120
I'm disappointed when it's not sadly not

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.880
much we can do about that right now

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:26.830
three pills though bad trip that stinks

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:29.590
I can see forever tears up we definitely

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.480
do not need to tears up but it could be

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:37.750
worse I would like some red hearts

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:43.870
please I would like some blue hearts

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:45.610
please I would like that to not be a

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.960
joke pill please we can't actually get

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.530
over to any of these either because they

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:53.530
blew up from like the inside out which

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:55.000
is a strange expression to say it sounds

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.940
a lot more violent than it actually is

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.590
but I mean this is a violent video game

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.690
better not bring your kids this is rated

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.880
M for Mature maybe even a Oh for adults

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.650
only should be IO

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:10.060
intellectuals only like Rick and Morty

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:11.950
right I know inspected I'm not trying to

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:16.720
just piggyback on that you know da e

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:18.610
Rick and Morty mean I feel bad about the

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.560
Szechuan sauce stuff not because I was

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.170
part and parcel to it but you know I

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.360
sort of made fun of Rick and Morty like

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.700
you know a year ago before it was cool

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.410
because the community was really I

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.450
wouldn't say aggressive but they

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.580
evangelized the the media property that

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.770
they enjoyed a great deal and I you know

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.260
I kind of take pleasure in ribbing that

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.120
because I'm a jerk I suppose but I feel

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.920
bad for Rick and Morty fans who are not

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.820
out of their minds which again is

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:49.850
probably like 99.999% of them you're

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:52.350
getting you know slandered

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.449
because a small subset of your community

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.610
are being jerks to McDonald's employees

00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:59.249
or were recently jerks to McDonald's

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.600
employees at the very least that annoys

00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:02.699
me but I didn't want to just leave the

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.819
floor I wanted to see what we could get

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:07.860
but baby I feel you in particular

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:10.050
because you know I'm a Vancouver Canucks

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.730
fan what a most like what is the average

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.429
hockey fan know about the Vancouver

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:18.689
Canucks that annoys me a great deal as

00:13:14.429 --> 00:13:20.999
well well you know the city rioted when

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:22.439
they lost in game seven back in 2011

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:24.410
thanks mama mega I really appreciate

00:13:22.439 --> 00:13:27.720
this thanks so much for your help

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:33.809
so yeah nice loss are you gonna riot

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:35.519
dude you know a few hundred jerks ruin

00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:37.290
it for everybody else I never ride it in

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:38.790
the city I wait patiently in line like

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.350
everybody else for my coffee in the

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.660
morning I don't I've just started

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:46.920
looting at the drop of a hat haven't you

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:49.619
heard the expression I'm not looting any

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:52.199
community can do it man it it happens so

00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:54.179
I feel for you I mean that sincerely not

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:55.559
to mention I watched some Rick and Morty

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:59.040
like two nights ago I was doing an

00:13:55.559 --> 00:14:01.529
assignment I had the television on I

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.949
said what am I gonna watch the 2008

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:06.959
cyber thriller untraceable has just

00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:10.639
finished it was about 72 minutes long

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:10.639
which is always a bad sign for a movie

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:17.579
watched a few episodes of Rick and Morty

00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:22.019
Richard and Mortimer and you know what I

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:23.519
was like this is a funny show do you

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:25.079
have to be an intellectual to understand

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:26.910
it no of course not that's ridiculous

00:14:25.079 --> 00:14:30.870
and the rest of you you know the ones

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.529
but yo posted on forums being all like

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.480
you got it

00:14:31.529 --> 00:14:36.720
who's your Rick we're sorry who's your

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.850
Morty I've taken it on me to bring a

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.449
Morty under my wing cool it you guys are

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:45.629
being weird it's a very strange Rick is

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:47.970
not the protagonist of Rick and Morty

00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:50.519
just cuz he's smart doesn't mean he's

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:53.360
like a good person being a good person

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:55.559
is more important than being smart I

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.399
know a lot of smart people who are

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:58.259
complete jerks

00:14:56.399 --> 00:15:00.350
I might even classify myself amongst

00:14:58.259 --> 00:15:04.190
them

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:06.630
which is how you know I'm a nice guy

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.190
anybody that classifies themselves as a

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:14.040
jerk it's got to be a stand-up

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:16.350
individual right it's much better to be

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.880
a Morty than a Rick except for the whole

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.230
sex robot thing I don't know I was

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.630
getting a little weird I'm not trying to

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:25.830
kink shame but get have a child with a

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:27.540
robot regardless you do have to be an

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.130
intellectual to watch the NL SS though

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:34.290
that's just the darn truth that we make

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:35.940
a lot of data is references in fact my

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:39.620
my parents said that my first word was

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.620
data not that I'm trying to brag

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:52.100
I do I mean we haven't gotten much value

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.930
out of the coop pool out of the coupon I

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.100
gotta be honest here we just should not

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.260
have taken mom's knife

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.580
mom's knife was actually not just a

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.770
regrettable choice for taking some

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.360
tension out of the run but our rate of

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.279
fire is so high it's making it very

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.920
difficult to hit enemies like the knife

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:09.589
speed is too fast

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.270
I can't reliably get the knife to stand

00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:14.420
on top of an enemy for long enough to

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:22.700
kill them in one tick a one one salvo if

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:25.250
you will so we can use a tears downgrade

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.290
I might even be of the opinion and it is

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.540
a rare situation but I might even be of

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.339
the opinion that tears downgrade with no

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:34.790
benefit is actually a good thing right

00:16:31.339 --> 00:16:37.790
now just to make the knife a little bit

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.920
more shootable well actually a little

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.930
bit more shrew double-o of the Dwight

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.220
variety we shouldn't moon card out and

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.200
take an item from boss dress because

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.600
we've already done boss rushes Eden we

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.160
do want to do the hush fight and to be

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.279
honest we probably could get away with

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.709
it right now but the the damage is not

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:56.510
good enough to be excited about it not

00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:59.660
to say we couldn't get it done because

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:03.700
mom's knife is kind of somewhat damaged

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.700
independent somewhat data independent

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:08.199
that was not smart

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:19.230
No Deal we take the negative both of

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:23.040
these items of trash at least right now

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:26.130
you give us magic mush not magic mush

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.079
but enough money we got two item rooms

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.670
we got enough HP to survive for the time

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:31.590
being at least we do want to make the

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.120
hush fight we got so much time for like

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:36.450
five minutes ahead of schedule for that

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.790
so your boy is zero percent sweating

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.370
that but he is kind of like 2% sweating

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:44.130
because it 26 degrees Celsius in the

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.240
office there we go whenever I say that

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.460
it's hot in this office people try to

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.679
temperatures blame me it's extremely

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.260
annoying haven't you ever heard of a a

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:54.000
fan well actually we have central air

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.620
you have your central air on in

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.010
September would you make up your

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.179
freaking mind what is it is the room

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.190
improperly ventilated or is it too

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:06.030
ventilated I don't know here's why the

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:08.880
room gets too hot at all times it's like

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:12.929
six feet by eight feet so it's quite

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.330
small it has no window it does have a

00:18:12.929 --> 00:18:18.960
ventilation like an air duct in it

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:21.600
however this room with the door closed

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.720
me spouting hot air everywhere plus you

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:30.210
know the ambient body temperature oh

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:33.679
this is a new room well to whom much is

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:37.880
given much is tested right and then like

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:41.640
where the thermostat is is in open space

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:44.730
stays cooler longer you know my wife's

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:48.570
office ends up getting extremely cold so

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:50.580
we kind of met Ki bum fantastic we're

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.540
kind of in a no-win situation she's too

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.540
cold I'm too warm

00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:01.770
so we both just kind of suffered to the

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:03.850
degree that is you know capable and

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.100
adjust the thermostat when the other is

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.360
not looking that being said if it's 26

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.760
degrees Celsius why am I wearing a

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:14.740
hoodie cuz I like it okay a hoodie

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:20.200
it's like adult pajamas that you can

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:21.970
sort of wear outside no restock

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.920
unfortunately we got a key for free we

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:27.070
will take this I think will pay seven

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.450
cents for a pill and I used it

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.910
indiscriminately which is not a very

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:35.530
smart idea let me just get this hoodie

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:39.760
completely off here we will not really I

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:41.020
haven't showered yet today I got any

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.730
ridiculous I wouldn't call it an

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.460
argument cuz I think it's it's more like

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:47.020
I mean the wafer is extremely good it's

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.360
more like a verbal sparring thing you

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:52.030
know people watch the NL SS they they

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.980
want to get in arguments that are like

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.540
pseudo logical extremes because it fits

00:19:53.980 --> 00:20:00.030
the brand of the show I can respect that

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:04.270
I understand it I was like you know I

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:05.980
shall once a day no matter what so first

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.180
I was like sorry I had to shower and

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.370
then Chad was like why are you showering

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.080
on a Sunday one person in Chapman said

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.610
that I should say and then I was like I

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.340
shower every day even if I never go

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.900
outside and then somebody else was like

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.150
only showering once a day and then they

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.820
made the gross face so make up your mind

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.020
you know Cosmopolitan group of numerous

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.080
amounts of people with differing

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:28.270
opinions why can't you just all agree on

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.040
this one thing I said that showering

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.720
once a day is average twice a day if you

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.520
go to the gym some people looked at me

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.140
and said no showering once a day don't

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.790
use that's gonna make you spend ten

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.890
extra cents a month on water and some

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.930
people said showering once a day you

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:44.140
must be real stinky the answer is both

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:46.840
of those are true I can be stinky and

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:50.710
also spend an extra 10 cents a month on

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:53.230
water it's a happy medium alright we can

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:59.800
actually keep the pills now that I think

00:20:53.230 --> 00:21:01.450
about it because of the oh yeah idiot

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.940
yeah I should have we haven't had the

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.050
backpack in so long I forgot we might as

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.020
well take this because we have the wafer

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:10.200
I forgot that we actually could have

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.000
taken

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:16.930
spacebar items so we could have taken my

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.690
lord maybe magic fingers would have been

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.370
the better call along with the coupon

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.670
although we and we could still use the

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:27.700
coupon like it might end up coming in

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:30.610
handy if we do go to the hush fight but

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.140
to be honest as nice as this run is and

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.030
it's pretty good

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.320
we royally messed up by taking mom's

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.330
knife and also we haven't gotten a

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:43.600
single damage up over the whole freaking

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:45.700
game not to mention every pill is

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.980
paralysis apparently except for the ones

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:52.240
that are locked down truth is like

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.750
what's worse a paralysis pill or a

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.520
lockdown

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.550
if you answered lockdown you are

00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:01.240
incorrect they're both worth noting

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:03.220
right now in fact if you really wanted

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.780
to be pedantic you could probably make

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.950
an argument that the lockdown pill is

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:12.220
better as ridiculous as that seems

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:15.520
because PhD would turn it into a lock up

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.990
grade that being said right kind of

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:23.680
approaching ridiculousness

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:25.000
range down might be effective if we were

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.560
forced to take the pills I'd much rather

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.940
take paralysis than a lockdown but we're

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.830
not forced to take either and we know

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:36.400
what they both are they're both exactly

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:40.000
the same complete junk it's the way I

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.650
see it at least it's the way America

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.920
sees it and it's worked out pretty well

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:47.320
so far

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.530
like the knife going too fast is just a

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.360
small subset of our problem right now

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:55.240
and it's manifesting itself as a disease

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.590
the disease here is that one touch of

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.650
the knife doesn't kill even the most

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:03.660
basic enemies normally that's like

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.660
almost never an actual problem

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:11.200
but times have changed even like with a

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.520
bunch of flies including rod and baby

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.440
we're not really getting the kind of

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.000
damage out but it really it's a time to

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.270
kill sort of problem like I want to kill

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.950
these enemies faster and I don't really

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.110
care by which means we're able to make

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.730
it happen I just want it to happen the

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:32.740
knife is not doing it as well as it

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:34.270
normally does so I might be content like

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:39.820
we're gonna make the hush fight unless

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:40.960
we really really slow down kind of

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:45.160
squandered our deal with the devil

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.540
chances as usual but we're gonna make

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.920
the hush fight the question is whether

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.930
or not we wants you with like three

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.480
point four damage I would settle for a

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.490
you know an even negative run obviously

00:23:52.480 --> 00:24:00.690
like if we could somehow make mega Satan

00:23:54.490 --> 00:24:00.690
happen that's theoretical possibility

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:09.910
please thank you infamy thank you infamy

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.380
times two on the same room one more hit

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:14.950
we can use to a diamonds get the heck

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:17.280
out of here okay the bloat will be a

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.280
test

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.789
please stay still one more attack

00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:30.249
one more attack we got him and a deal

00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:35.710
with the angel would be incredible

00:24:30.249 --> 00:24:38.990
dang well paralysis yet again small rock

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:43.129
to spear at arts still good maybe an

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:45.320
ampere or something hermit geez man down

00:24:43.129 --> 00:24:48.009
we go still waiting for our first damage

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.009
upgrade of the game

00:24:56.559 --> 00:25:02.360
continue moving on here

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.279
one of those runs I used to say it was a

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.679
weird run but this kind of run archetype

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:08.720
happens more often than I think I give

00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:14.059
it credit for we're going really fast

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:17.320
but we feel really weak it's like being

00:25:14.059 --> 00:25:19.249
in a bad space ship I feel uneasy

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.690
despite the fact that you might look at

00:25:19.249 --> 00:25:25.429
it and go you're in space you're going

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:29.509
so fast George why is it called a

00:25:25.429 --> 00:25:33.049
spaceship and not a space plane I mean

00:25:29.509 --> 00:25:34.820
it's got wings don't even get me started

00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:36.769
what do you take to the airport a

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.960
shuttle what do you take to the

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:44.539
International Space Station a space

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:47.029
shuttle it doesn't make any soup I don't

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:50.889
pump out well this is what would happen

00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:50.889
if Seinfeld stayed on the air till now

00:25:54.159 --> 00:26:00.169
was a little risky and not very

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:06.429
intelligent dude I'm not even yanking

00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:06.429
your chain this game is 100% luck downs

00:26:08.379 --> 00:26:15.559
and paralysis pills that's it it's just

00:26:12.889 --> 00:26:18.940
luck downs paralysis pills the

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:18.940
occasional chariot cart

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:26.389
more keys I'm starting to actually

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.710
especially given the size of the floor I

00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:29.840
was just gonna say I'm gonna doubt our

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.789
ability to make it the hush but actually

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.620
like we have a 50% chance deal with the

00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:36.830
angel could give us key pieces we might

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.240
be able to finagle a mega Satan win but

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.279
you'll have to forgive me this just

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.370
seems like a tedious potential hush

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:45.260
fight I don't really even with a fully

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.669
charged coupon and enough keys to go to

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.130
those item rooms I don't really want to

00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:51.880
do it if we get incredible items I might

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:55.850
consider it right here but let's see

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:58.279
okay I mean we don't need HP yet so

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.019
crown of light is really useful this

00:26:58.279 --> 00:27:03.440
also gives us a key piece which gives us

00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:04.789
an outside chance at a and a mega Satan

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.340
fight how would we do it we'd have to

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:09.080
get a joker card where's our most likely

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.750
chance to get a joker card you don't

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:15.860
want to you don't want to know because

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:17.779
the answer is definitely through the

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.690
blue womb and we got to remember when we

00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:26.210
leave I mean we could do delirium but

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:30.320
not super into that idea well it's

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:32.240
actually pretty good so far we want to

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.100
leave to Sheol is what I was getting at

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.840
o deaths touch absolutely it's also it

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:41.480
tears down oh I thought it was a tears

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:44.740
downgrade will take ruin bag we can make

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.740
use out of potato peeler

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:49.519
we didn't get it though we got the

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:52.600
ladder instead lovers card is worth

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:57.169
something I think we do want to like

00:27:52.600 --> 00:28:00.940
what what's wrong with my face what

00:27:57.169 --> 00:28:04.250
happened my images folder is corrupt I

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:07.029
think I want one Cuba meets with a small

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.029
damage upgrade

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.330
stick with too hard stick with a coupon

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:19.320
like what's all the textures are

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.550
corrupted dude we want the pills still I

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.860
mean they haven't done anything we might

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.990
as well take this the pills do anything

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:28.320
for us maybe maybe not

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:38.990
oh the game is about to crash Isaac -

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:38.990
new game has stopped working any moment

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:53.040
we're back continue please please be the

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:56.400
same items looks like the same items

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.350
alright well in that case maybe don't

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.030
take any of the items on there potato

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.030
peeler is not incredibly useful

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:15.750
why did we have 13 damaged when we

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:18.660
walked in here last time we had double

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:27.090
damage why was that was it because we

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:29.400
had full HP so the crown was active it

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.630
might be give me a set as soon as we buy

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:35.910
a potato peeler it just screws

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:37.200
everything up yeah okay we're gonna roll

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.930
with this thing in the hopes that it

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.780
doesn't crash the game so let's never go

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.430
back into that room so potato peeler was

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.250
actually unbelievably useful and I'm

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:49.470
glad I got a chance to see that instead

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:51.060
of just getting like an 8 damage bonus

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:53.340
and not knowing what caused it what

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:55.380
caused it is being at full HP which we

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:58.050
could have done regardless probably but

00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.600
I mean crown of light gets the full HP

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.310
bonus is what I mean to suggest but is

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.110
what gives us the full HP bonus rather

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:06.150
but potato peeler allowed us to not have

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.860
to buy a red heart and get some extra

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.860
damage out of the existing red heart

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:12.480
that we have plus giving us an orbital

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:16.980
might be of some value as we get later

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:20.720
and later here now it doesn't look like

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.720
we're gonna be able to fight delirium

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.150
I'm not I'm not completely against the

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.510
idea

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.920
we don't have delirium done uneaten yet

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:32.130
the truth of the matter is although it

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:34.020
looks like this is kind of a plausible

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.820
mega Satan run we need to get a deal

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.650
with the devil to make it happen and I

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:42.150
don't know what the odds are there

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:44.220
however I know that if we get the key

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.230
the second key piece our odds of beating

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.060
mega Satan are much better than our odds

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.710
of beating Delirium we still got the

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:54.510
whole floor of Delirium items to work in

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:55.890
our favor as well so the answer I mean

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.070
quite truthfully is just that I don't

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.820
know maybe it's better maybe it's worse

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.840
we're gonna have to make a decision

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.840
pretty darn soon

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:11.890
one thing's for sure though it was a

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:14.170
very fast mega satan fight by mega satan

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.630
i mean the hush of course and by the

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:19.680
hush I mean hush didn't want it distract

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:19.680
you there with the wrong name

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.440
hmm Eden's blessing has appeared in the

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:31.210
basement that's fantastic news that's a

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:36.399
lovely item I think I'm gonna try to

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:40.179
lyrium I don't love our odds because the

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:42.849
run is basically 150 thousand percent

00:31:40.179 --> 00:31:51.129
dependent on the success of our damage

00:31:42.849 --> 00:31:52.599
right now so if we lose if we lose the

00:31:51.129 --> 00:31:56.409
bonus from crown of light we're in a

00:31:52.599 --> 00:32:02.019
weird spot but we haven't lost the bonus

00:31:56.409 --> 00:32:04.330
from crown of life okay I wouldn't say

00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:06.580
we're figuring the room out but you know

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.769
not taking as dumb of damage as we

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.389
oftentimes used to the gauze is fine

00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:12.450
let's stack up this HP as high as it'll

00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:12.450
go

00:32:12.929 --> 00:32:21.369
we have no teleporters so we have to

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:25.749
exercise some common sense essentially

00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:27.549
just avoid what's going on here avoid

00:32:25.749 --> 00:32:32.799
accidentally walking into the Delirium

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:35.889
fight do some analysis on whether or not

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:39.700
it's likely to be a safe Basara a

00:32:35.889 --> 00:32:41.080
dangerous boss or an undercover boss

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.409
that's the one you got to worry about

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.409
the most

00:32:47.809 --> 00:32:52.229
you guys know they made a website based

00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:56.039
on Undercover Boss yeah it's called

00:32:52.229 --> 00:32:59.210
glass door it's not glass doors a real

00:32:56.039 --> 00:33:02.879
website I'm just trying to you know

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:04.889
excuse me does he the secret room is

00:33:02.879 --> 00:33:07.320
here why can I not see it

00:33:04.889 --> 00:33:11.489
pardon me I'm a little confused and

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.739
perturbed by the situation those are new

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:16.259
enemies I don't want to know what you do

00:33:13.739 --> 00:33:22.320
looks like high range like sprinkler

00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:28.529
shots dude that's a plus 8 damage

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:30.119
upgrade I don't know what it was I can

00:33:28.529 --> 00:33:36.809
tell you what it wasn't definitely was

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:39.269
not haggle eyes that's like an

00:33:36.809 --> 00:33:42.029
unbelievably strong crickets head pick

00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:45.739
up the coupon does nothing you know

00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:47.879
there's no shop down here excuse me

00:33:45.739 --> 00:33:49.529
safety scissors is irrelevant the more

00:33:47.879 --> 00:33:51.210
flies the merrier these are new enemies

00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:56.779
as well oh they're not new enemies we've

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:56.779
seen them before could be worse

00:33:58.999 --> 00:34:02.789
every bomb is like a one in three chance

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.139
at a spirit hard when you find a blue

00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:08.879
fire so fairly content there continue

00:34:07.139 --> 00:34:09.569
taking the bombs the keys largely

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:14.129
irrelevant

00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:17.359
ah that was bad damage I think if this

00:34:14.129 --> 00:34:17.359
is delirium I'm okay with it

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:24.290
we did leave our two of hearts card

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:30.320
behind we should go back for that did I

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:32.300
leave it behind like a flora go where

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.330
did it go I don't see it under I do see

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.440
it okay we'll go back for it on route

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:38.180
the other thing is we can use the arrow

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:44.080
we can double some spirit hearts but we

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:47.120
could also double our two of Hearts card

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.750
which would give us a lot of renewable

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.750
HP for the Delirium fight assuming notes

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:56.180
we can't carry two in with us that's

00:34:53.750 --> 00:35:02.810
fair might be better off just doubling

00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:05.300
spirit hearts if we find any other year

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.860
Arun what I'm getting at is just that

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:13.310
multiple two of hearts don't do anything

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:15.820
for us until we get like polydactyl or

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.820
something like that

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.430
the gods always happy to get into

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.570
Gossard we could have doubled that we

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.610
could have actually quadrupled that

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.840
you're not wrong starting to think that

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.340
we made the right decision to come down

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.610
here but the Delirium fight you know it

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:36.610
is it is humbled many of us in our days

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:39.030
No No thank you sir I'm not interested

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:44.100
in buying what you're selling

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:49.780
mama Gerty aka another easy free item

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:53.250
I'll take the HP on soos so we know that

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:55.960
one of the three boss fights that's not

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:57.730
that one or the one that we're the two

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.260
that we're about to go into is going to

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.360
be delirium I think it could technically

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.130
be the one on the right but it's very

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.020
unlikely given how the floors generate

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.430
keep in mind we have the wafer as well I

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.880
just remembered we actually have way

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:13.240
more HP than it seems like we do yeah

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:15.220
we're gonna be fine I think you know

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.420
there's also there's a clever I wouldn't

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.070
call it a get-out-of-jail-free card

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.070
there's a clever path that we can take

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:25.660
where you know we get hit maybe we get

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:27.120
down to one H or the two HP let's say we

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:30.190
use two of hearts

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.110
we use two of hearts get back to full HP

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.520
then every time we take damage we could

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:36.190
use the potato peeler and get a little

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.450
damage bonus stay at full HP I'm not

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:41.110
sure if that's actually relevant past

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.660
this point but stay at full HP and also

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:46.090
get another level cube of meat as well

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:47.770
kind of an interesting thought process

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:52.270
although it's extremely unlikely to be

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:54.220
relevant it might seem like we got like

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.530
an easy stomp here but I do want to

00:36:54.220 --> 00:37:00.370
remind you that I doubt that that's

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:04.990
gonna be the case once we or slash if we

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:08.160
lose a crown of light because that's

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.160
gonna have our damage I think

00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:15.019
I think have it like full stop how love

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:19.490
it if you will because I think we're

00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:21.950
gonna lose the full bonus from crickets

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:23.960
head as well hey it's not like crickets

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:26.089
head is gonna continue to give us half

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.190
of what it sorry 100 percent of what had

00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:29.269
already given us I don't know if what

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.589
I'm saying makes any sense here

00:37:29.269 --> 00:37:35.119
regardless we found delirium it's one of

00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:38.349
the few times over the course of this

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:44.319
whole run here that were gonna be happy

00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:44.319
that our knife has such ridiculous range

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:57.400
did we accidentally like completely kill

00:37:53.170 --> 00:38:02.430
I don't know how we did it we did like

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.430
90% of deliriums health in a millisecond

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.850
infamy is putting in work by the way I

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:21.370
don't know what we did dude

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:24.960
but delirium just got screwed over there

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.960
goes any desire to have to dodge

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.160
all right easy when I'm glad I went for

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.260
delirium it was a weird run

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.480
I kinda wish we stuck with not moms

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:39.680
knife but you know our damage definitely

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:41.300
came through in the end regardless if we

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.730
get eaten soul dude that is an awesome

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.810
item I'm actually happy to have it for

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.980
now thanks for watching I hope you guys

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.030
enjoyed it if you did click the like

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.810
button upside a great deal of course

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.920
subscribe you don't see more in the

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:52.360
future before nowadays watching and I

will see you next time
