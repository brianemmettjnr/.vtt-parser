##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.400
everybody welcome back to northern land

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.220
please binding my second trip plus you

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.570
might as well knock out some greedier

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.630
great ear who is the ideal ear greedier

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.710
player to provide us with a seat here

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.160
you know what I mean

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.080
it's the they rhyme sort of so or Eden

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.160
we're gonna try Eden do to the coupon

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.080
ms4 wn7 XR with 3 HP terrible speed

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.420
immediately mitigated by the pickup of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.010
the speed ball but are you seeing this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.550
coupon thing that we got going on here

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.010
cuz like I just got potato peeler for

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.340
free I know that sounds like a spam

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.559
comment you'd see on a blog working from

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.329
home I was able to get this potato

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:55.850
peeler for free but it's the darn truth

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:58.140
isn't it also I just realized if we can

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.110
hold up your hold up I want to get 5

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.909
cents if we purchase a battery charge

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.369
the worst possible outcome is that it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.490
gives us something else worth 5 cents no

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.290
it's like an infinite upside I'm gonna

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.590
take the potato peeler and I'm gonna be

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.930
a moron and I'm gonna pop it 3 times

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.490
because I first off knock three times on

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
the ceiling if you want me secondly I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.049
think this is gonna be a not just for

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.060
the damage bonus but for the third level

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.310
meat boy I think third level meat boy

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.200
could really expedite the process of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.759
getting through these earlier waves not

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.340
to mention I mean you know five point

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.869
two eight damage is okay but I don't

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.040
think we want to use potato peeler

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.860
forever I don't even think we want to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.520
use potato peeler like much more than

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:54.659
this third level is okay however I will

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.189
admit that I wouldn't mind getting a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.110
little bit more like if I can get a ton

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.299
of HPV we can get a prayer card that we

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.350
can use endlessly sign me up so I'm not

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.420
gonna be stepping on the button because

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.299
that's gonna cause us to lose HP in the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.239
process we also started I'm just

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.940
realizing with the BB F which is very

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.569
dangerous for us but also potentially

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.870
fairly high damage

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.670
play our cards right and by the way this

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.739
the start of this run is a microcosm of

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.599
like my way of playing Isaac in general

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.280
we started very comfortably with respect

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.950
to our HP and I traded all of that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.200
comfort away for just like the slightest

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.900
bit of extra killing potential that's

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.870
how I play the game and it's usually

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.549
it's okay sometimes it's you know

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.280
catastrophic and makes me look like a

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:43.930
moron but we hit 14 cents so we're gonna

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.670
coupon again we got a red heart that's

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.069
pretty bad we're gonna buy probably two

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.819
three cent keys in fact actually let's

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:56.799
buy let's buy this key coupon we got a

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.810
bomb that's not that bad actually

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.450
and then we'll buy another three cent

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.980
key we probably will not get enough to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.470
go to the boss fight but I think that's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.239
okay

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.609
now Book of Revelations is like actually

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.870
good because we have a deal with the

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.720
devil approaching I'm gonna do something

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.489
that's kind of ungraded aspyn name of

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.260
the mode we're gonna buy another spear

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.099
at our just so that we have the ability

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.220
to take a deal with the devil but I

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.209
think you've got to stick with coupon

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.760
especially if you can find a way to get

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.579
a lot of battery charges out of coupon

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.470
like if we can get a battery baby or a

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.479
d20 or you know anything even remotely

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.440
along these lines that allows us to kind

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:40.750
of wheel batteries into existence we can

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.060
get unlimited items and consumables for

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.190
free we're not gonna quite get to enough

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.229
money which actually means I'm gonna

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.549
purchase two keys just because I want to

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.680
keep our money high and yet at the same

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.930
time I also want to make sure that I am

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.549
buying discount keys because you know

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.680
they we might never see them for three

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.359
cents again so it makes sense to stock

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.959
up like we're on Extreme Couponing or

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.560
something you know the ultimate

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.750
injustice of the world is that I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.459
guarantee the cashiers and servers on

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.650
Extreme Couponing if you haven't seen it

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.840
it's an American reality show where

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.000
people with too much time on their hands

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.609
donate on the Mandel they're just being

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.650
frugal okay you know what it's like

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.250
positive hoarding it's like fiscal

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.980
hoarding

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.650
not necessarily always a bad thing a was

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.720
the gossip op the guys will pop the guys

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.980
will pop the gossip but that the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.090
greatest injustice is that the we might

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.850
as well do the last room there could be

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:46.360
poop in there or just enemies but still

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.330
what's we got a free sister Maggie

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.580
that's not great but considering you

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.760
know we didn't pay anything for it it's

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.500
pretty good plus a coupon charge the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.660
greatest injustice is that I'm pretty

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.940
sure the people who were Extreme

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.900
Couponing got paid to be on the TV show

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.760
and I doubt that the the person involved

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.090
in actually totaling up the transactions

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.640
aw freakin dime dude always like you

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.560
know they see they got a loophole in

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.360
here if you buy eight hundred soup cans

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.160
technically that counts as both a

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.900
multiple of an eight and a multiple of

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.220
ten so you can double dip on this coupon

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.540
shouldn't they use two bombs for this

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.910
but what's done is done

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.770
cashier needs a PhD in discrete

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.990
mathematics in order to understand how

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:37.930
to total the thing up well we've got so

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.320
much HP we should keep this and it was

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.260
worth it in some ways I think we should

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.990
buy meat and you're gonna say I know

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.570
you're gonna say why not just try to use

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.940
the coupon the answer to that is

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.650
actually I I think that it's the right

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.660
idea to buy a good item if we have the

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.480
money in the early game because it's not

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.510
like we're it's not like this 15 cents

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.100
has any chance to make up the 99 cents

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.750
that we're gonna hopefully use to finish

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.550
this off I mean we only have like 30

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.419
cents to go anyway on the greed machine

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.640
so dude the greed machine sounds like an

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.919
awesome name for a novel eventually

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.820
turned into a 1970s movie that doesn't

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:21.600
quite match the caliber of the novel the

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.600
greed machine

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.620
be about like the government bailout of

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.810
General Motors in the 1980s thanks a lot

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.350
Lee Iacocca I have no idea what I'm

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:36.620
talking about I just know that Lee

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.330
Iacocca you know that's like master

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.300
level spelling test word right they're

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.290
not too relevant in the modern era I

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.100
don't know what Lee Iacocca's doing now

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.450
[Music]

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:56.350
it's just a great name one of history's

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:59.420
greatest names Genghis Khan

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.930
Kubla Khan all the cons actually Khan

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.580
was a title his real name was Temujin

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.710
where are we going with this well I'm

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.360
just I'm stalling for time a little bit

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.890
as I figure out what we're gonna do with

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.600
this coupon you might think the best

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.010
idea is to use the coupon endlessly and

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.830
most of the time I would probably agree

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:20.210
but without a without a reroll machine

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.070
if we get one of these items they're

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.280
gone forever still I think we should try

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.530
it

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.480
we got a battery charge we got HP I

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.650
think that's actually fine we probably

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.880
shouldn't have taken it in until we saw

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.570
what was in the deal with the devil but

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.060
that's okay

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.230
speaking of which we didn't get anything

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.270
in a deal with the devil but what I

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.250
think I'm gonna do again we can afford

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.660
to be spending cuz then we're a long way

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.020
from the end of the game and the reroll

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.310
machine is we're starting out the reroll

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.010
machine the donation machine is almost

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.690
cats so great shot great shot I didn't

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:54.920
have a lot of real estate there what I'm

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:57.320
gonna probably do I think is by the by

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.940
the the gift and then use the gift on

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.610
our devil or angel deal to get a free

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:04.760
item in there you never know what we

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:09.650
could be provided glorious bounty or a

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:12.230
slap in the dang face but we'll take

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.150
coupon with us to leave as you might

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.520
expect all right this is gonna be like

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.460
absolutely the hardest wave we've had so

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.880
far you know would be an actual 10 out

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:26.150
of 10 item BFF I don't know if it

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.700
actually improves BBFS clothes

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.880
but it would make the Super Meat Boy

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.900
substantially more deadly which is kind

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.849
of what we're looking for

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.669
our own damage hasn't improved too much

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:39.020
but we're very very close to spun and I

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.659
think the coupon represents an

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.520
interesting item that we can really take

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.440
long-term you know if it gives us a

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.980
space bar item and a consumable per

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.480
floor that's like an you know 140 cent

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.390
value or something by the time we reach

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.420
the greed fight now we don't really need

00:08:53.390 --> 00:09:00.970
140 cent value what we need is damage

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:04.510
and tears but well we get something

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:09.560
excuse me please give me a perthro

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:13.130
immediately Wow so double lovers and

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:16.880
double haggle eyes that is just

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:21.950
horrendous complete waste of fifteen

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:24.740
cents I'm sorry to say um it's not worth

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.920
haggle eyes than that probably save it

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:30.140
for not just a better chance at a crawl

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.120
space but like a guaranteed tinted rock

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.520
or something I'd kicked my garbage can

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.529
that's how mad I was I was so furious I

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:41.360
said I hate garbage and I kicked the can

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:43.400
magic mush twenty out of ten

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.880
Necronomicon does take us closer to

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.350
bookworm otherwise not too useful here

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.570
try a little Huggle oz with four skulls

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:55.190
three of them turned into jerks not a

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:57.410
big fan no battery charge available lots

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.660
of pills though 48-hour energy please

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.570
now I'm trapped in a fecal prison of my

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:08.510
own creation mm-hmm pardon me retro

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:10.790
vision probably not worth the card but I

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.850
figured you got a try right and by gada

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:16.459
I mean we had absolutely no external

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:19.730
incentive to try but three sent cards

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:22.700
I'm a believer dude five cents no way

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.550
son three cents

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.760
sign me up I'm gonna step on the button

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:31.270
we have HP to burn which is a dangerous

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.270
line of reasoning

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.910
pop that yeah that's that's pretty much

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:41.800
what I was looking for odd mushroom

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:44.589
minor damage downgrade for a huge tears

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.560
upgrade I'm gonna try to incite a reroll

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:48.940
which is exactly how that happened and

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.350
now on our next charge we might be able

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.980
to get another space bar item of some

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:56.019
use these six I mean I would prefer to

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:59.379
get a passive because I'd like to stick

00:10:56.019 --> 00:11:03.160
with the coupon but still pretty good

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:04.540
and this is like the highest value

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.310
skinny odd mushroom I think I've come

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.050
the skinny on mushroom is one of those

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.910
weird items that I've had like I've

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.560
reversed my opinion on like 20 times

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:14.259
it's like my opinion of the Darren

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.180
Aronofsky film the fountain first time I

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:17.980
saw it I thought it was pretentious

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.899
garbage next time I saw it I was like

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.430
wow it's an ambitious film it deserves

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:23.620
some credit for that next time I saw it

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.139
I was like are there any actors in this

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.310
except for Rachel vice and Hugh Jackman

00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:30.310
next time I saw it I was like you know

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.629
what it's a little underrated people

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.100
don't give it the respect it I just like

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:37.600
every time I watch it it's like flipping

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:39.310
a switch feel the same way about skinny

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.500
odd mushroom like two episodes ago I was

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.269
like it has no purpose this episode was

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.329
very good I think the the reality of the

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:48.730
situation is that it's probably good for

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:51.130
us in situations in which we've gotten

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.930
no tears upgrades or in fact maybe even

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.939
tears down grades because basically

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.040
doubled our rate of fire and took our

00:11:54.939 --> 00:12:02.139
damage down by like a twelfth or

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:07.420
something or name rather alright coupon

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:10.569
it up here a ninth I guess get the lucky

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:14.290
horseshoe no think we want anything else

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:20.080
it's kinda tempting to go for the to go

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:25.730
for the box I don't think it's right

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:27.320
please shoot at all Jesus please shoot

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.470
at one of the other enemies okay me Boyd

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.730
finished you off sorry about that kind

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.080
of tempting to go for the box cuz we're

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.270
gonna have to buy a key anyway so we

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.740
kind of paying 10 cents for the box

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.240
because we're getting a key that we

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.880
would normally probably buy for five

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.830
cents anyway but is it worth 10 cents

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.960
you know you get a bomb you get a

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.820
trinket you get a card it probably is

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.000
but I think we're approaching the point

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.500
at which we want to be a little bit more

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.450
thrifty with art with our finances just

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.280
so we can self-select the best possible

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:57.710
items although to be honest our dps is

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.600
like quite good finally we get a deal

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:03.100
with the devil that actually provides us

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:05.450
an item the item is actually bad

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.330
ingredient the transformation is lovely

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.590
so we're gonna try we're already on the

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.260
womb here this one's popping off pretty

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:15.320
quick by the way I have that not many

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:18.110
but the occasional comment that's like

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.420
you know it sucks or that listen that

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:23.510
sucks is a strong word right it stinks

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.490
that you know there's one Isaac a day

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:30.620
and sometimes it's like 20 something

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:32.630
minutes long I feel yeah but it's like I

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.570
don't want to say growing pains it's not

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.070
the right word it's just a byproduct of

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.590
the fact that greedier mode tends to be

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.500
shorter ones greed greedy or etc etc are

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:45.650
done those are gonna be definitely not

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.620
the norm I think we want to go for a

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:52.700
reroll here once we get coupon but so

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:54.710
just you know I'm trying to make sure

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.200
these are an equitable length of the

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:59.870
most part you know as long as they can

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.670
be without spinning their wheels rarely

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.490
am i like a blank card Emperor let's

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:08.780
just speed through it step on this

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:10.220
please thank you but just it's a

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.290
byproduct of the fact that you know

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.330
greedier is shorter tends to be shorter

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.830
at least and you tend to like ball out

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.839
of control on those runs if you get the

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:23.150
right combination of items which show up

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:26.660
like all the time key not bad not really

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.550
what we're gunning for we might want to

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.260
go pajamas cuz our HP is kind of bad so

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.140
let's not be like a hand waving away the

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.730
criticism rather it's me

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:37.870
understanding the criticism but also

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:42.730
just illustrating that it'll uh it'll be

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:44.950
over relatively soon I mean greedier is

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.200
already we've got like seven or eight

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.750
greedier runs to do bare minimum but the

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.160
machine is like dustin more or less so

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:54.040
we don't have to do any grinding which

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.660
is very very nice now well what I'm

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.860
saying essentially is never fear we'll

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.930
be in the era where people will be

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:03.130
asking for greed mode runs soon enough

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:04.630
it will happen I promise you that so

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.390
we've actually timed our charges

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.980
decently here got quite a lot of money

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.300
not that interested in donating much

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.710
more interested in survival I mean if we

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.410
donate like five cents on every

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:16.810
remaining run we will max that machine

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.430
out no we didn't time it properly

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:23.470
alright I can't afford to spend any more

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:24.760
HP willy nilly I think so I'm kind of

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.380
saving my money at this point cuz I

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.480
think that we've got oh that was very

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:32.860
dangerous that was just stupid we got a

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:35.140
very good chance to defeat ultra greed

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:40.000
in the with the stats that we've got

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:42.610
right now but I also okay also don't

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.610
think that it's even close to guaranteed

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:48.400
so I'm basically saving all of my money

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:51.600
to devise spirit hearts or items that

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.600
could give us spirit hearts

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.180
and it's looking like pyjamas is

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.160
probably a good pick up here well isn't

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:04.020
it like 15 cents for three spirit hearts

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.760
maybe it lowers tear delay I can't call

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:09.460
so we bought Spyder mod I'm sorry we got

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.680
spider mod for free it's okay I will

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:16.180
take PJ's it's for spirit hearts so it

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.170
is a deal I don't think we need to buy

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.550
spirit arts yet

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.010
it's just something I'd like to do in

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:23.140
the future probably lump of coal is

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.640
worth it I will take Jesus juice

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.839
sure we're not gonna be able to save as

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.839
much as I might like but

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:39.060
Jesus you sended up being a little bit

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:40.769
of a unexpectedly not that amazing

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.170
damage upgrade it must be a damage

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:44.940
multiplier like a the reason I say that

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.769
is because sometimes it's great and

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.329
sometimes it's bad and I'm assuming well

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:50.040
not bad but sometimes it's not so great

00:16:48.329 --> 00:16:51.720
and I'm assuming that the time so it's

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.029
not so greater when we already have a

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.100
damage multiplier that cannibalizes it

00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:57.630
like in this case magic mush so I mean

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.490
why don't you just look it up on the

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.899
wiki oh why don't I just look up the

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.630
answers to life the universe and

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:05.069
everything on the wiki you know why

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.559
don't I take all the fun and now I'm

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:09.449
just lazy I look up my meals on

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:10.980
Wikipedia I never look up anything

00:17:09.449 --> 00:17:14.730
related to my work because then it would

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:19.919
spoil it for me my lurk I never look up

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:23.220
anything related to my work anytime

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:24.630
anybody in a movie says my work they're

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.540
doing something they shouldn't be doing

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:30.419
lay there resurrecting you know human

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:35.150
corpses or something Kapila duplex is

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:38.700
okay and some HP is okay both of these

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.900
kind of similar in my eyes well they I

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.549
mean not similar in terms of what they

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:47.010
do that would be ridiculous but speed

00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:51.179
irrelevant retro vision just bad car

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:54.630
battery it's like a little late for car

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:57.450
battery to be very good but you kind of

00:17:54.630 --> 00:18:00.840
still want to take it right like double

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.760
coupon I think if I wanted the guppy

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.350
dream that to come to pass we pretty

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.630
much needed that to pay out right there

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.730
so this could give us 15 cents which

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.880
would be very nice

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:13.500
instead of give us zero it's another

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.500
it's an alternative outcome of which I'm

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.419
substantially less excited and I

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:23.070
actually think that the best thing we

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:26.040
could do is pay for car battery and then

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.929
using our full coupon charge maybe like

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.000
re-roll then we don't need to reroll if

00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:31.650
you pay for it that's right pay for car

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.160
battery then using our full coupon

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.160
charge

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:42.370
Rolle immediately and hope to get

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:49.090
something of value or two things of

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:50.500
value rather I think there's still time

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:57.790
for us to make it work we got like one

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:59.590
one point something floors left that was

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:02.770
to be fair first time I've been hit by

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:06.670
my own BBF I think but not a good place

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:09.820
to stand admittedly so this is kind of

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.680
where I think the Run will not

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.410
necessarily live or die but I think it's

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:18.280
got a chance to improve drastically

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:20.110
right here I guess the other question is

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.600
do I like any of these items and even

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.920
the toothpicks is unnecessary so we're

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.580
already at the tear cap so just try to

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:30.040
roll and these are not necessarily much

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.690
better but let's try so we got a red

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.250
heart and the battery the battery does

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:39.670
not give us an instant charge which is a

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:41.710
bummer and a free battery is actually

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.290
not bad but it's again kind of a little

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:46.060
too late to be of peak usefulness

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.260
because early in the game the battery

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.060
would have been awesome me we ended up

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:52.140
probably wasting a lot of our coupon

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.140
charges unfortunately

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.880
just from not being fully charged but I

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:04.540
almost think that we have a chance for

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.920
like a novel break you know everybody

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.480
blank card Yara

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:11.740
blank are two of diamonds these are the

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.580
classic breaks chaos b20 what can we do

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.310
in this situation

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.240
well you're me out here what if we

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.310
reroll the machine until we get a

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.610
battery charge by the battery charge and

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:24.090
then get extremely lucky in our car

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:28.360
battery holes so bad our car battery

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:30.340
coupon allows us to continually get a

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.990
battery charge and an item per roll I

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.790
think none of these are worth it even

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.550
though book where I'm exists they're

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:40.390
just not good enough so I'm gonna I'm

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:42.730
gonna try please

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.580
Thank You battery no battery I'm gonna

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:52.180
try to sense no okay so we're just gonna

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:54.610
leave instead leave instead Sunna Jesus

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.560
a blank but okay we don't even have it

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.700
item rooms on this one I forgot so this

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:06.160
might be a good floor to just purchase a

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:10.450
lot of spirit hearts will I do so well

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:15.190
that's an interesting question think you

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:17.260
start oh oh I leave even though that

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.050
costs us the spirit art I believe in

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:23.590
this energy and we got to make up a lot

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:26.380
of ground HP wise on this floor okay so

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:29.590
start pop that we got a battery charge

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:32.890
and we got mom's key mom's key gives us

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:35.980
two keys open this thing up key in

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:38.370
several bombs use the bombs to get a

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.370
little money

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:48.410
we don't really want black hole or dull

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:53.090
razor we can live with that so what we

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:54.890
want to do is reroll probably a little

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:58.610
too much in money but now I've spent it

00:21:54.890 --> 00:22:00.050
so uh I could use the HP loops a kick to

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.590
my garbage can that time not out of

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.170
anger

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:05.750
so buy this go for that we did get the

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.370
HP that's pretty lucky I also got the

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:11.240
fungi transformation so it was worth 2

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:16.700
HP and now we'll we'll leave here and

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:20.480
try this again probably should have

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:22.460
spent the bomb on the reroll but all we

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.670
need to do is win here and the stats are

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:27.320
good dude the stats are good it might be

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.000
for the best to just use like all of

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.770
your remaining money to purchase spirit

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.910
arts but I don't think we have spirits

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.910
in the rotation just yet

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:44.290
probably also would be good to stop

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:52.150
wasting HP by stepping on the button

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:55.590
every time the batteries coming in full

00:22:52.150 --> 00:23:03.690
effect all I to speed allowed me to

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:03.690
destructively dodge right into it stop

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:12.130
should have enough to buy a couple of

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:18.970
consumables or create like a single

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:20.410
reroll which is sadly more along the

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:23.290
lines of what we need to do okay

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.450
I mean starter deck is okay we didn't

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.090
get either we got a key and a trinket

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:31.770
that's pretty terrible I'm gonna go for

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:35.730
like a probably very ill-advised reroll

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.730
by a battery charge

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:44.890
we got a spirit heart and a red oh yeah

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:49.150
spirit Arden a key and try this again

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:51.340
yeah then we got pay to play not worth

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:53.830
much except allows us to buy one of

00:23:51.340 --> 00:24:00.429
those so we can definitely create an HP

00:23:53.830 --> 00:24:02.320
upgrade and get the battery charged so

00:24:00.429 --> 00:24:04.600
having done that we now take the battery

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:08.740
charge re-roll we don't really want

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:10.300
clicker or speed we could use HP I could

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:14.320
use the fanny pack what else do we got

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:18.850
the other key okay so we picked up a lot

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:24.340
of HP on this floor is it enough I don't

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:27.370
know I feel like I've I don't think I've

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.130
abused you know cleverness to ruin my

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.380
run accidentally I think I might have

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:35.140
spent a lot of mental energy to mostly

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.610
like move laterally I think we could

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.140
have improved ourselves just as well by

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.580
purchasing good items instead of

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:43.080
spending all our money on rerolls and

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.080
battery charges to get them for free

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.390
we're not gonna have enough to buy

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:58.440
anything else so we're pretty much

00:24:53.390 --> 00:25:03.420
locked in at this point let's clear out

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:07.790
the riffraff please oh okay I mean we

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:11.510
got red hearts galore potentially so

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.510
don't let me stop you

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:19.080
we're hoping for a devil deal then

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.660
actually like it would have to give us

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.580
either absurd potential or would have to

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.500
give us HP like an equivalent amount if

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.360
we spend one to get the the mark that's

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.910
probably worth it if we spent two to get

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.110
the pact it's probably worth it what

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.420
another thing that might be useful is if

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.530
we can just like get a sun card or

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:39.420
something like that or even a full

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:42.500
health pill would also be fine algae's

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:45.270
would be good well I think he just did

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:48.150
take this blank rune and hope for the

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:50.400
best at this point I'm gonna try that we

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:56.880
can't hold two cards right we can hold

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:59.370
two trinkets yeah well against my better

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.080
judgement no battery charge let's leave

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.610
I still want to donate something you

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.590
know you got to strike a balance we'll

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.450
probably get some money when we kill the

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:09.150
first phase here like when we kill greed

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.920
but the first room rather the whole

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.960
point of this room existing I'm pretty

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.310
sure is just to give you some money you

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:19.220
can donate even if you spend all your

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:19.220
money on the previous section

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:26.109
I would like you to be algae's please

00:26:22.889 --> 00:26:29.399
for can L so we got a blank rune

00:26:26.109 --> 00:26:32.559
Birkenau and a regular Birkin Oh

00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:33.850
Nell begins the long haul unfortunately

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:36.639
we got to focus for this whole fight

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:40.029
because I mean as you can see our damage

00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:41.619
is not necessarily that good got

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:46.359
third-level meatboy ensuring that the

00:26:41.619 --> 00:26:50.070
super armor never wears off didn't think

00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:50.070
about that at the time of its creation

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:56.229
but I certainly think we have created an

00:26:52.570 --> 00:27:02.399
interesting an interesting greed mode

00:26:56.229 --> 00:27:09.159
run greedier but you get the idea

00:27:02.399 --> 00:27:12.029
we're probably gonna die I do I think

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:12.029
we're gonna die

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:21.820
you know sometimes the right way is the

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.260
right way for a reason

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.299
and I've been trying to I was breaking

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.740
the mold on this run what you god I knew

00:27:26.299 --> 00:27:30.320
we've been at it so long you know we're

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:36.710
playing our four thousandth Isaac run or

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:39.169
something like that but time will still

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.730
tell this was a smart decision but it's

00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:41.240
certainly not looking that bright right

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.159
now

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:47.330
you might even say is looking kind of

00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:54.679
dumb don't finish the lyrics don't you

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:56.389
dare you know what would have broken

00:27:54.679 --> 00:28:02.019
this wide open I hate to say it because

00:27:56.389 --> 00:28:02.019
it would be boring as heck but nod Leif

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:09.950
that was the most incredible shot of all

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:13.159
time with nod Leif we could just stand

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:17.630
still and let let third-level Meat Boy

00:28:13.159 --> 00:28:19.340
take care of all our woes for us that

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.830
was embarrassing like that final fight

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:26.510
was just bad but we need it a little bit

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:28.340
more than I had there I kind of feel

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.840
like our stance betrayed us like we

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:33.620
should be able to do better within that

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:36.350
with the with ten point four six and a 5

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.120
rate of fire but I don't know I tried

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.590
even we'll have to do it again but it

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.600
was a fun synergy between the coupon

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.130
battery charges and car battery

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.720
