binding of issac afterbirth plus one day

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.360
if they keep making expansions for this

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.540
game which I don't think they are but

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.520
the intro is gonna be like 90 minutes

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.170
long hey everybody welcome Akron Lyon

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.180
plays The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.080
plus and also there's another one super

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.029
mega eternal addition here 2021 version

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.199
don't laugh it could happen

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.870
Isaac is like tapped out here I'm gonna

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.820
do a normal style run Eve

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.559
I mean Eve if you would put money on her

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
being the first posted note that gets

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.520
filled up you would be like you know

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.690
you're talking about right you're

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.950
talking about northernlion

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.840
doesn't even know how to use the razor

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.190
blade doesn't understand it as an item

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.570
by the way she doesn't start with the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.180
razor blade for whatever reason even

00:00:48.570 --> 00:01:00.649
though it says she does 0 MJ h PM dr p

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.960
md r is the the penal commander not in a

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.600
fallacious way it's the prison's

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.130
commander on like a military ship like

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.409
in the 3rd Alien movie that I've never

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.330
seen I don't know what I'm talking about

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.920
anyway so weird layout for a floor we

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.810
were only one room away from the boss

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.280
fight to start with I kinda want to get

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.500
hit once to go into the Whore of Babylon

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.920
State I know we've unlocked the razor

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.220
blade it's like the game lied to us said

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.159
Eve now holds the razor blade and then

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.540
later it had its fingers crossed

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.159
do you guys subscribe to that notion by

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.799
the way the answer is probably no cuz I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.140
imagine most of you that aren't that are

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.689
watching this are in the double digit

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.210
ages I always thought that was kind of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.439
BS as a kid

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.930
we can't reroll so I think we just take

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.880
blood of the martyr it's it's good it's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.259
just maybe there's this one of the ones

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960
I underestimate her one of the ones I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.790
overestimate I thought I under it sorry

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.439
I thought I overestimated it because it

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.909
made my tears red and I always assumed

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.820
that was like a damage quadrupling

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.160
before we had the HUD but yeah even as a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.170
kid people would be like hey yeah Prem

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.819
is to come to your birthday party and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.420
then they don't come to my birthday

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.390
party and I go

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.130
you know Michael Han soos what gives I

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.530
had my fingers crossed

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.790
this is totally not a real story but I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.080
wanted you to believe it was a real

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.170
story momentarily

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.290
Michael Han soos is a former Center for

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.490
the Chicago Blackhawks Los Angeles Kings

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.870
Philadelphia Flyers etc etc anyway I

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.030
don't buy into that notion I think if

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.350
you say something you should mean it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.450
unless it's obviously in a satirical

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.740
context I don't want the same rules that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.080
I apply to other people applying to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.959
myself I didn't realize actually not

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.370
only were we one room away from the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.250
that's pretty much garbage

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.900
not only were we one room away from the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.070
deal with the devil or is the boss

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.390
fight' I should say we were actually on

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.070
an Excel floor which means that that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.230
first time we got hit ruined our deal

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.780
with the devil chance but you know you

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.970
can still beat the odds pick a number

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.260
between one and a hundred and I'm being

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.200
honest with you do it right now pick a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.739
number between one and a hundred do it

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.480
did you choose a number between two and

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.180
thirty eight if you did you're 36

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.720
percent chance just panned out

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.860
congratulations if you pick the number

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.410
that was higher than that

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.110
well you're terrible at this game it's

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.370
not random chance I expected you to mind

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.019
my psychology for some useful

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.170
information and you know what you let me

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:37.030
down moving on though we have one more

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.769
tinted rock oh we might as well at least

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.110
pick up Dead Sea Scrolls I mean we can

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.150
use it I just don't like to use it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.570
because it kind of stinks it's just not

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.250
really a good item some of the times it

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.750
can help us some of the times it can can

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.910
screw us pretty badly we could

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.390
potentially engineer a cube of meat to

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.410
show up by using it and I'll use it

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.000
again I don't know what that one was

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.110
doesn't look like our map has changed so

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.280
I think we got the shovel and then

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.080
something else I was hoping to get Book

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.820
of Revelations and create a cube of meat

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.880
but it's a pretty low percentage play so

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.519
not overly concerned plenty of spirit

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.479
hearts and hopefully an eternal heart

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.190
maybe or well disregard so don't really

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.590
care about the shop but the exception

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.580
will be if this is the secret room which

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.150
it is not all right

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.560
kind of a waste of two bombs there

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.569
we go down to the Duke of flies the run

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.569
seems okay so far I mean if damage-wise

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.460
it's very good we're working towards

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.159
bookworm which think is one of the like

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.569
it's one of the best transformations but

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.759
only because like a lot of the

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.759
transformations are just kind of jokes I

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.509
mean it's no copy transformation it's no

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.800
beelzebub transformation but it's

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.439
probably better than like the mom

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.000
transformation or you know fungi or

00:04:53.439 --> 00:05:00.009
something like that either way though

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.270
champion monstro is gonna get taken out

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:08.860
here and we got nothing to worry about

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.509
except rolling the dice lucky us pretty

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.689
terrible deal you know what if we got we

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.580
already have mega Satan still let's try

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.349
to make some deals with the angel happen

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.449
here in that case I won't take the HP

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.310
because I don't want to ruin whore

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:28.089
Babylon it's a pretty big component in

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:30.370
our overall damage right now is this

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:33.310
another excel it is another excel floor

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.930
dude it never ends

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.580
but also this makes it faster I'm trying

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.899
to think of a real-world analogue that

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.649
makes any sense there and there just

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:51.430
isn't one just get through this quickly

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:55.960
pop this open five extra bombs that also

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.210
do some poison damage and then infinity

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.349
extra bombs that also do some poison

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.000
damage dude if we seen no we have seen

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.649
golden keys I'm trying to think like I

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.210
get so confused about what we have

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:09.250
unlocked and what we don't have unlocked

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.339
as of this point in the game because

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:15.819
like there's a ghost of a memory in my

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:17.800
head what it meant to be you will expect

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.710
to me I tried so hard dude that was like

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.180
verbal spaghetti but also apparently

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.430
that's how my brain remembers the lyrics

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.430
to in the end by Linkin Park

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:37.639
there's a ghost in my memory and it says

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.960
hey we could just get you know holy

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.250
mantle here I guess we could get holy

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.110
mantle we could just get this sight if

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.669
we could just get this sytem but they

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.669
may or may not actually exist in our

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.110
overall save file as of just yet I think

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.370
I figured out the pattern though I mean

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.820
I should know this considering I've done

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.240
it before

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.800
um no reroll machine makes me an unhappy

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.830
camper but let's see spider mods okay

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.970
mom's key is pretty good I'm not looking

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.580
for pretty good if I was looking for

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.500
pretty good I'd go eat a ham sandwich

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.160
right now but I'm not gonna go eat a ham

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.229
sandwich right now I'm gonna hold out

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.889
for maybe you know a prosciutto sandwich

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.510
on focaccia freshly baked I'm not in the

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.419
interest of just being pretty okay here

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.460
that's actually not true

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.310
my wife is away right now so I've been

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.259
eating just garbage

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.419
pretty much just and that's not to say

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:31.190
I've been eating unhealthy like a couple

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:33.470
of nights ago I went to the grocery

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.919
store I bought two red peppers three

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.949
jalapenos two green peppers three cans

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:42.650
of crushed tomatoes bunch of beans beef

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:44.449
stock ground beef etc et-cetera made

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.729
myself an enormous pot of chili the

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.770
macronutrient breakdown on it I assure

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:50.930
you is incredible I won't belabor the

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.159
point though it's a healthy meal I don't

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.650
know why chili is one of those foods

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:57.490
that I feel like people assume then it's

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:01.400
unhealthy even though it's basically a a

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.830
stew made with a lot of vegetables in it

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.300
but anyway I digress but when it comes

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.370
to I don't know if anybody else can

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.500
relate to this but there is a person

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.380
inside of me who is I like Oscar the

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.510
Grouch like he lives in a trash can and

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:17.360
when when your significant other is

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:20.030
there that gets suppressed you know cuz

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.440
I can't just eat two spoonfuls of peanut

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.820
butter for lunch cuz I could be judged

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.810
you know my wife could come out of her

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.099
office and be like why are you eating

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.169
peanut butter for lunch and then I got

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:28.370
to explain that deep inside of me

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:30.229
there's a man who wants to live in a

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:34.640
trash can in there you know it's it's a

00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:36.560
little bit it's too real so now that

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.339
she's not here I've been I've been

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.180
maintaining a pretty adult regimen you

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:42.860
know I've done the

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.260
dishes I've done the laundry cleaned the

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.830
house bought the cats some cat food

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.630
clean the litter box etc etc but also if

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.160
I have like ten minutes for lunch I'm

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.279
like what if I just took a slice of

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.500
cheese and some ham out of the

00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:00.320
refrigerator and just rolled it up maybe

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.300
put a little bit of Nando's extra hot

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:06.740
piri piri sauce in the middle that's not

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.779
that was a deck of cards

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.190
that's not a good lunch there's there's

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:13.190
a lot wrong with that lunch

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:17.360
it's a sad lunch and I'm not one of

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:18.620
those people you know sometimes people

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.570
that watch the stream they'll be like

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.540
you know I had a handful of tortilla

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.700
chips and you know a can of apple juice

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.040
for lunch I go that's sad they go that's

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.990
not know do being an adult means no one

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.180
can tell you that what you do is sad no

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.899
that's exactly the opposite of how it

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:40.730
works if a child had that for lunch you

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:42.620
would say the parents are negligent if

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.260
an adult has it for lunch you go oh no

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.640
baby what is you doing that's not okay

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.970
you know you're supposed to be eating

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:54.500
some kale now and then at least so I've

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:56.630
been striking a balance for sure I found

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.370
like my laziness like lost its luster

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.310
like I'm not gonna lie I love my wife

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.860
but I was looking forward at least a

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.660
little bit Ali along with the you know

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.480
the melancholy of like oh I'm gonna be

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.550
living alone for like ten days there was

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.360
a little bit of like you know Macaulay

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.980
Culkin I can do whatever I want you find

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.810
out I don't know I don't maybe it's just

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.550
me but whatever I want to do gets old

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.040
after like two days something I can play

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.170
here's a storm until 4:00 a.m. and eat

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.230
food that doesn't even taste that good

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:32.420
but is also bad for me oh I just ruined

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:34.940
whore Babylon like a like a moron like

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:40.310
two days in I was like I need a kale

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:42.020
salad I know this is like YouTube poison

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.720
as well youyou want me to be the guy

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.029
who's like not son I'm 30 and you can

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.240
eat hot pockets all the time and totally

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:52.910
maintain six-pack abs but I'm not I'm

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.140
just not lying to you that's that life

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:59.840
holds very little glam

00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:01.370
for me anymore grab that you I mean we

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.750
could have gone deals with the angel but

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.380
I think at some point we just got to

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:09.020
accept like we got a chance here cuz I

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.840
know what it's like to be young cuz I

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:15.350
still sort of am I'm young in relation

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.060
to old people I used to be young in

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.320
relation to young people many of you are

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.420
probably in that space right now I know

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.040
you know you might have older siblings

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.150
or you know your parents are telling you

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.950
they're like you know you can't eat what

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.110
you want forever and still stay skinny

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.720
in your head you're like logically that

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.550
makes sense I am gonna take teleport but

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.230
you're like that's not gonna be me I'm

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:38.030
gonna be the exception that breaks the

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:39.920
rule 100% cuz I know what it's I know

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.720
what it's like you think you're not

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.250
necessarily invincible and this

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.900
obviously doesn't apply to everybody

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.060
when I bring up stuff like this

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.400
oftentimes people go well you know I've

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.230
had eight brain surgeries since I was

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.790
born I obviously don't think I'm

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:56.000
invincible look you're the exception of

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:58.580
the rule keep it up no question it's

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.990
very noble and B it's very human story

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.480
and I appreciate you sharing your

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:08.290
perspective on it but cuz I thought I

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:15.410
was in that boat as well let's do it

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:17.149
we should just teleport out but I'm here

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.579
to tell you that it's it's a good thing

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:21.199
you will age you will grow up but as you

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:24.740
do you'll find that it's not a bad thing

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:30.649
it's a good thing most of the time I

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:32.240
think every age strata we should play

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.350
that guy why not right

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.779
check all this stuff that we missed

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:39.019
before earlier I think every age strata

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:41.360
holds interesting things and I say that

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:43.040
as somebody who has only existed in like

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.889
what have I been at like a toddler don't

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.259
remember been a young child been a

00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:50.329
middle schooler been a teenager been a

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:56.990
young adult I'm probably just an adult

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:58.880
now I'm probably at the point where you

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:01.190
know if you saw me get arrested for

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.449
something stupid as opposed to something

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.300
smart which I don't even know what that

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:06.860
would be political protest or something

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.769
you saw me get arrested for something

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:13.579
stupid you would be like he should know

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:16.790
better if like 20 year old gets arrested

00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:19.610
for something you know like public

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.019
mischief you're like you know what they

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.189
should still know better they shouldn't

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:24.649
have been doing it but they're young

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:26.569
everybody's young once you see a 50 year

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:29.540
old get arrested for public mischief you

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:31.279
go hmm what happened you know it's not

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.980
necessarily fair maybe we should judge

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:36.139
everybody on a similar spectrum but I

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.990
think that's a valid thing you know I

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:40.339
think that's how a lot of people think

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.319
but I don't know dude honestly like I

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:47.569
like being 28 what do I like about being

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:50.029
28 I have a stable life I'm kind of like

00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:52.730
I have a routine things are not in flux

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:54.050
when I was younger it was you know what

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.399
are you gonna be doing next year I don't

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.170
really know I don't even they haven't

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:59.449
released the course calendar for the

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:02.689
third year yet so I am NOT a hundred

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:04.610
percent sure when you're like 11 years

00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:07.130
old every year is like nine percent of

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.750
your life so it's it's a huge change now

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.730
every year is like three percent of my

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.560
life you're kind of like a similar

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.660
person year over a year once you get out

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.480
of your your early 20s I think but I'm

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:20.380
looking forward to you know being in my

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.380
30s as well

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.980
and to be honest with you I think I'm

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.780
like most looking I don't want to rush

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.490
it you know I'm enjoying the roses along

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.940
the way no question I think I'm like

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:37.150
most looking forward to being 50 like 50

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:40.120
to 55 cuz I think there's just something

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.980
about a 50 to 55 year old man that like

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:47.230
commands a certain level of respect like

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:48.670
when I see a a kempt 50 year old man in

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.590
public I go you know what that guy's

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.600
probably got some stories he's got some

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.250
wisdom he's got some lessons he's

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.680
probably like the CEO of Merrill Lynch

00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:00.160
I'm not accusing him of tax evasion

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:03.180
necessarily but you know ever every 50

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.650
year-old I meet in public is like a CEO

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.660
in my head cuz I never actually talked

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.610
to them because of you know mild social

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.230
anxiety but also the social convention

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:14.340
of you know just go out and talk to

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.390
strangers like this is in 1920s

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.620
Minnesota or something like that people

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.620
have got places to be

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.970
probably anyway

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.890
I'm even looking forward to being 80 if

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.300
I would first off it's a privilege to

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.360
make it that far I think it a lot of

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.370
people won't there's a chance I won't

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:40.030
hopefully modern medicine keeps me going

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.770
until then but we'll see people are

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.810
optimistic you know I think people my

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.130
age 25 percent of them think we're

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.750
probably gonna live forever that'd be

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.520
sick I'm all-in I'm not one of those

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.490
people who's like it's only special if

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.860
it has an ending you know look at

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:57.100
jeopardy jeopardy special no ending on

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.600
the horizon for that price is right

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.550
still going everybody thought it would

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.080
die when Drew Carey took over there's

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.310
probably other analogies that we could

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:09.070
use that aren't related to game shows

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:10.270
but I'm not interested in those okay but

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.830
I'm looking forward to being 80 you know

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.810
why I mean there's yeah probably

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.600
aches and pains and you know seeing

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:20.320
loved ones struggle with health concerns

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.330
you know friends maybe not there any

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.690
longer but at the same time you can do

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.720
whatever you want you're 80 the worst

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.760
thing that anybody's gonna do is be like

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.390
he's old you can get away with it it's

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.540
not like I even have

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:38.210
desires that could only come out as an

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.760
eighty-year-old but it's just like I

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:43.550
would finally be able to judge people

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.710
with good reason hey is that where I'm

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:50.210
really gonna finish that one obvious ad

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:52.730
like I'm so burdened as a young person

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:55.100
I'm expected to look at evidence and

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.530
change my opinion and you know think

00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:00.110
about things logically and have a

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:02.930
barometer for the you know societal

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:05.000
attitudes that change over time that's a

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:08.209
lot of work dude it's much much easier

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.589
to just hold an opinion and then if

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:15.800
somebody goes that's ignorant you go

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:17.750
come on dude he's 80 you did try to

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.190
explain to an 80 year old what cosplay

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.860
is a lot of 80 year olds I'm sure

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.150
open-minded you know some of them you

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.220
know one bad apple don't spoil the bunch

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.140
but I'm just saying if there's ever a

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.900
time to not be open-minded it's when

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.250
you're 80 northernlion that's ignorant

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:39.290
look it is ignorant all right I'm

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:40.760
cracking a joke apologies if it does it

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.560
doesn't hit a hundred percent I'll be

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.570
honest with you I was gonna say I know

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.430
some cool 80 year olds but I don't I'm

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.890
like one order away from that in

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.840
abstraction I know that there are

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.910
probably some cool 80 year olds

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:58.000
I don't know them I don't run an 80 year

00:17:52.910 --> 00:18:01.550
old circles okay I know like cool people

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.110
plus or minus five years of my exact age

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.510
at the present moment I don't run in

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:08.630
circles outside of that not as a rule

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:15.830
just as like a day I barely leave the

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:16.990
house for the most part we're gonna do

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:21.460
with the world card

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:24.110
well forget me now is really more of a

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:27.040
really more of a boss rush escape give

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.040
me a second here to caffeinate

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.660
and spill half of the coffee on my

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.560
mousepad

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.560
there you go

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:40.510
I don't know I'm just saying it's rough

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.750
because you know I well it's not rough

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:45.280
but I talked to people I remember and I

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.500
think I've told this story before but

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.900
you know we're on episode 8000 so that's

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:53.380
gonna happen from time to time a friend

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:56.200
of mine in college his birthday was one

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:59.860
month before mine he was 19 he turned 20

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:03.070
I talked to him and he was like visibly

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.360
down and I was like dude what's going on

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.820
hey Singh you read it

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.159
that's a stupid what do we get together

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.370
in coloureds case enough Paul Simon

00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:15.970
references but um he said like you know

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:17.140
it I'm old now I just turned 20 as a 28

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.000
year old that sentence seems hilarious

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.289
in hindsight it kind of seemed delirious

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.179
at the time I was like what are you

00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:23.770
talking about there's people you know

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:25.510
everybody's I think got their own

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.039
well maybe not everybody but a lot of

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.610
people have like their own threshold for

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:31.990
when they think you know young life ends

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:40.179
and and what things hold after that I

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:43.150
don't know I sort of disagree I do until

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:45.549
life becomes pain I'm happy to be there

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:48.100
like if I'm a hundred and I'm in

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:49.390
relatively good spirits heck yeah I hope

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.100
that if I made it to a hundred I

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.809
wouldn't be like I wish I was twenty I

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.320
hope that every day I wake up I'm like

00:19:52.809 --> 00:20:01.630
oh my god I'm a hundred that's amazing

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:02.710
I've lived for an earth century I hope

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.380
that I would be like that I think a lot

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:07.360
of people would but I'm here to tell you

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:10.000
I did you know life doesn't necessarily

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:14.350
stop as he aged she got you got Pinochle

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.120
class shuffleboard me and my friends go

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:18.429
on a cruise once every seed I'm

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.130
pretending to be older than I am right

00:20:18.429 --> 00:20:22.780
now is the joke there hundred percent

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.950
chance of a deal with the devil here I'm

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:28.990
just donating as much as I can because

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:32.350
because we can can't believe we haven't

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:36.039
gotten any more damage since the first

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:38.890
Excel floor although I would like to

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:41.440
make boss rush I also accepts might be a

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.960
little on the the close side I think we

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.450
got a decent chance but oh that was a

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.440
bad bomb it wouldn't surprise me if we

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.090
all just walk

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.070
freaking blew fire wouldn't surprise me

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:54.309
if we just slightly whiff on being able

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:57.279
to make it just realize our luck stat is

00:20:54.309 --> 00:21:02.950
pretty good which is very valuable when

00:20:57.279 --> 00:21:05.190
you're very valuable when you're relying

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:09.090
on red hearts to drop

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:15.700
we could always it's a tough one

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:17.019
skirt we could always use the devil card

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.850
to make the mom fight go faster because

00:21:17.019 --> 00:21:24.850
we don't really have like a great anti

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:26.019
mom build right now but I think we'll

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.019
still be able to do it like within a

00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:31.419
minute here and if we can for example

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:33.129
because dang baby I can't do it that

00:21:31.419 --> 00:21:37.389
fast but I know someone who can Ludo

00:21:33.129 --> 00:21:39.879
it's not Luda it's twisted you get the

00:21:37.389 --> 00:21:41.950
idea though heck I guess that's my

00:21:39.879 --> 00:21:43.539
preachy soapbox for today you know you

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:47.110
might say NL you've gone on this rant

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:48.820
before but at least it's not in talking

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.009
about programming again I don't know

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.600
what I didn't realize everybody gets so

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:53.980
offended by the program you talk I was

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.710
kind of mining it for a joke you know

00:21:53.980 --> 00:22:01.919
the a e.substring indices start at zero

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:04.240
it's it's offensive to some people even

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:05.259
it's just stick to talking about the

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.360
National Hockey League

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:10.029
Oh hockey's not cool now we got it okay

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.679
I'll stick to talking about divinity all

00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:14.049
you stinking divinity don't talk about

00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:16.090
divinity okay I'll talk about you know

00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:18.639
Canadian culture we hear enough of a Dae

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.620
&amp; L's Canadian you can't win you know I

00:22:18.639 --> 00:22:26.379
got to talk about these universal

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:27.879
experiences cheese cheese is good they

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:30.429
all like it oh I'm lactose intolerant

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:32.080
you know what get out then get out of

00:22:30.429 --> 00:22:34.870
that enough of this I don't mean that

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.070
I'm just you got to take the negative

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.659
there I know you were thinking he's

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.600
gonna forget the negative no chance

00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:44.919
buddy we were seven seconds too short

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:47.259
for boss rush well we're just going to

00:22:44.919 --> 00:22:49.389
the negative path so we might as well

00:22:47.259 --> 00:22:51.760
just use forget-me-now right now to get

00:22:49.389 --> 00:22:53.440
another item room

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.940
I should say to get another item room at

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.780
minimum that's pretty solid I don't want

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:05.140
you to leave if you're

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:09.160
lactose-intolerant I was that was

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:11.320
ignorant of me but there's always like

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.030
don't take this the wrong way people who

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.390
are lactose intolerant you got no choice

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:18.490
in the matter all right

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:20.050
but you are you do represent everything

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.240
that I hate on this planet that's not

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.740
true you represent some of what I

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.800
dislike on the internet which is like

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.900
hey cheese is good and then someone in

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.610
chat goes will let if you're allergic to

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.110
it in this case I'm throwing the baby

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:36.160
out with the bathwater that's a very

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:38.050
valid reason to not like cheese you know

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.090
what's weird is that like we as a

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:43.270
society or at least me as a judgmental

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:47.080
person we treat some allergies as more

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:49.990
real than other ones like if someone

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.870
goes I'm allergic to peanuts

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:56.410
everybody goes oh that must be hard some

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:58.420
people I just drop my my mouse pad on

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:00.070
the ground here but some people and I

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.840
don't I'll never understand this line of

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.160
reasoning I know that some stand-up

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.360
comedians hold it I don't hold it

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.370
against them because they're telling

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.010
jokes but at the same time they go like

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:11.080
look if they want to eat peanuts who

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:13.090
cares if it's poison for some people I

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.160
should be able to eat him they should be

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:18.160
the ones who are treated as lepers what

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.830
is wrong with you that's an extremely oh

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.860
no baby what is you doing what have you

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:25.720
built up a tolerance to arsenic you

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.740
start taking it out everywhere dusting

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.300
it around play it's it's not my fault

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.400
you haven't built up an immunity to

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.290
arsenic and Al that's a logical extreme

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.730
is it

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:39.370
peanuts are literally poison to some

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.230
people I love I'll say it okay I love

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.270
nuts and you can take that out of

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.250
context if you want that's like the

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.540
oldest double entendre in the book but I

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.330
love nuts

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.140
I could literally I was saying earlier

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.460
in the episode

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.850
I mean peanut butter out of the jar I

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.820
love it

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.230
if you can't like make a lunch for your

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.270
kid that doesn't have nuts in it you

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:03.040
can't you know go on an airplane without

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.660
eating some peanuts come on have some

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.500
sympathy for your fellow man but either

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.140
way

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:10.360
nut allergies are considered like one of

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.820
the valid ones I'm guilty of this too

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.770
sometimes people go up I'm allergic to

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.720
apples and I go come on

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:19.510
what do you mean you're allergic to

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:22.240
apples that's not a thing

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:25.330
spoilers it's totally a thing Nick's a

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.159
little allergic to apples I say a little

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.659
allergic cuz it's like it I mean I guess

00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:29.530
he's fully allergic but the symptoms

00:25:28.659 --> 00:25:31.840
aren't that bad

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:33.640
I had another I had a friend in

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.409
University and I want to spoil this

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.400
right off the bat by the way this is a

00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:43.330
real thing he claimed to be allergic to

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.559
shrimp but only the small shrimp big

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.990
string all this should have done that

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:48.429
big shrimp regular-sized shrimp no

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.049
problem but you know we we had our

00:25:48.429 --> 00:25:52.620
university cafeteria so they were using

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:54.970
cheap shrimp and it's the tiny stuff and

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.480
we were we were all like you are an

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.370
idiot

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.049
how you can't just be allergic to one

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.640
kind of shrimp you could totally be

00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:05.250
allergic to one kind of shrimp as we

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:08.169
found out later that's pretty good I

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.580
feel for you because I'm and I think the

00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:15.000
majority of people on earth are in this

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:17.799
boat I I'm not allergic to anything I

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.299
think that's the norm I'm not allergic

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:23.049
to much at least like I don't have

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:27.159
spring allergies really or you know

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:29.200
summer allergies hay fever etc etc and I

00:26:27.159 --> 00:26:30.669
can eat pretty much any food I used to

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.960
but it made me self-conscious when I go

00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:34.539
to the doctor they go to you know do you

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.039
have any allergies and I go well like my

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:37.840
great grandfather's allergic to

00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:39.039
penicillin so we're not sure it's like

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.500
just to have something to tell the

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:42.760
doctor if I say no the doctor might

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.860
think I don't know what an allergy is

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.429
but if I say I might be allergic to this

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:50.440
then you know surely we've got some kind

00:26:48.429 --> 00:26:55.299
of non allergenic penicillin at this

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.669
point right penicillin was invented and

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:59.559
like that for the 20s or something

00:26:56.669 --> 00:27:02.289
anyway the point is that's silly we're

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:04.330
gonna you know we as a society think

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:07.929
that some allergies are more valid than

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.669
others like a shellfish allergy hundred

00:27:07.929 --> 00:27:12.159
percent everyone goes I get it yeah

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:14.409
shellfish very common allergy if I was

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:16.120
like I'm allergic to bananas I think

00:27:14.409 --> 00:27:17.830
like 80 percent of people would be like

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.019
no you're not

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:22.210
you know I mean I'm not in this case

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:29.440
you're right but don't let that distract

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:32.620
you strange to me just just some little

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.529
bone to pick you can't choose what

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.700
you're allergic to

00:27:34.529 --> 00:27:38.590
sometimes your allergies change as you

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.750
get older too like I think I might be

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:45.580
getting mildly lactose intolerant

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:46.960
either that or let's just I know that we

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.370
could probably take both and permanent

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.929
polaroid invincibility is obviously a

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:54.399
good thing to have but why not just

00:27:51.929 --> 00:27:56.289
double up on the negative just in case

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:59.620
one takes precedent over the other

00:27:56.289 --> 00:28:02.519
I don't mind sacrificing a spirit heart

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.519
here to finish this off

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.929
it's either that or you know the fact

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:13.240
that all of my tissues are slowly

00:28:10.929 --> 00:28:15.279
getting older and you know mildly not

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.690
working as well as they used to is he is

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:19.149
starting to catch up with me you know

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:22.960
it's one of the two sometimes I'll eat

00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:25.720
cheese and then like a few hours later I

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:29.610
go stomach could feel better not quite

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.610
like terrible yet but could feel better

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:38.440
Aroo the day if you had to get rid of

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.090
one food group let's and and it still

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.080
maintains the health consequences it's

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.490
not like you can just get rid of

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.970
vegetables and then you don't need them

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.730
anymore

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:47.380
if you had to cut one food group

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:49.269
completely out of your diet what would

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.620
you cut out I don't even remember what

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:52.330
all the food groups are to be honest

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.299
with you cuz the pyramid was built by

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.419
like you know the Quaker Oats Company

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:58.330
Shiva

00:28:55.419 --> 00:29:00.850
25 servings of oats and grains every day

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:03.460
oh sorry we meant to that was supposed

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:06.639
to be the one for livestock but now it's

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:10.080
out for public consumption I think you

00:29:06.639 --> 00:29:13.890
know meat fruits and vegetables dairy

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.050
grains oh dude it's pretty good

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.630
[Music]

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:21.060
not good enough I think that dairy is

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.690
like my number one to get rid of I love

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.220
cheese

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:27.930
I do we don't need it and we don't need

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.430
cheese either I would I would be sad

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.340
everyday that I could no longer have

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:34.440
cheese that I had taken a cosmic wager

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.760
that made it implausible for me to eat

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.460
cheese but it's really only cheese

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.310
there's a lot of cheeses but I think I'd

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:45.390
get over it I've really I think I like

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:50.190
bread and rice more than I like cheese

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:53.280
and I think I passed of course as well

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:55.770
but and I think that if you got rid of

00:29:53.280 --> 00:30:00.900
fruits and vegetables I would be dead

00:29:55.770 --> 00:30:02.550
within like five years so I think it's

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.480
probably I know a lot of you are gonna

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:08.310
say fruits and vegetables and I respect

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:13.230
that you know it takes different strokes

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:14.970
to rule the world but I don't know I I

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.200
quite like them I think a lot of people

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:19.890
quite like them I think the second

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:24.930
easiest camp to get rid of as meat to be

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:26.430
honest with you can still eat legumes as

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:31.170
long as you got fruits and vegetables in

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:35.130
there it would be harder to give up then

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:36.660
dairy but I think it's I mean obviously

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.490
it's very doable there's a lot of people

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.800
live their lives with that dietary

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:43.200
choice to begin with just an interesting

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.110
question I think it's like the question

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.230
of you know if you had to give up one of

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:53.190
the you know the primary starch ously if

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:54.870
you had to give up potatoes rice pasta

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.220
or bread which one would you get rid of

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:59.820
first

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.530
I probably get rid of past the first I

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.000
know I say it weird that's not the

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.950
subject of the conversation you're

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.210
trying to derail me right now to be

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:09.510
honest with you I don't really

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:12.110
appreciate it trying to have a

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:14.490
conversation here you know get to know

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.870
the person watching the video a little

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:20.039
bit give them some questions that they

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:21.720
can ask themselves and in the process

00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:22.980
maybe learn a little bit more about

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.919
themselves and about the people around

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.960
them it's like a little miniature NL SS

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:30.030
or something but that would definitely I

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:34.500
would dump past in a heartbeat I love

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:36.870
bread toast bagels sandwiches what about

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.730
tortillas to be honestly to be honest

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:43.169
with you don't eat enough tortillas for

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:43.500
them to factor in probably but I wish I

00:31:43.169 --> 00:31:45.090
did

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:52.409
I'm jealous I'm jealous that you

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:57.090
apparently do rice would be next up

00:31:52.409 --> 00:32:00.659
though bread is just like I'm too

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:03.000
European like somewhere in in my

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:07.140
ancestral history there was like a line

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.090
of a hundred generations in a row where

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:13.440
the only things people consumed were

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:17.330
like 3% stouts a loaf of bread and like

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:20.130
half of a brick of cheese every day I

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:23.280
can feel it calling to me on an

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:25.440
ancestral level you know every every

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.870
time my body's like I'm hungry I'm like

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.840
eat body what are you hungry for it it's

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:33.600
like eat a single Apple and eight slices

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.450
of bread with a pickle and I'm like it's

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.100
not that's not right dude you sure you

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.940
don't want like a lentil soup no I don't

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.940
want a lentil soup

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:52.559
give me a Guinness half a kilogram of

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:54.330
unleavened dough and a wheel of Brie

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:56.300
that's not a good that's not a good

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:59.660
lunch

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:04.880
I'm not glamorizing this the bread beer

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:07.130
and cheese lifestyle by the way we're

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.440
gonna win like outrageously it's

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.820
actually like an ideal win condition for

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:16.430
me because we're not even gonna have a

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:20.240
chance to fight hush just remember just

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:23.240
remember we do not want to go to the

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.850
cathedral we would like to go to Joe we

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.240
won't go to Cathedral we will go to

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.240
Sheol

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.430
any chance you can block some of these

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.560
incoming shots dark bum it's not really

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.570
in your wheelhouse but would have

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.860
appreciated it either way little cheese

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:48.200
just gonna be awesome you a little

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:51.470
cheesed kind of whipped on these deals

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.540
with the devil I thought dim bulb is

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.490
doing good work for us but it's really

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.520
banking on kind of getting some more

00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:04.280
devil deals we get like three over the

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:07.460
course of the whole game mind you we did

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:11.300
have excel floors so it's a little on

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:13.940
the that dampens your expected value

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:18.140
okay I just didn't tell a frag by

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:20.810
enemies dude never gets old we're immune

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:22.100
to explosions remember that one day they

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.400
might heal us for now we just have

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.400
immunity

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:29.100
it's probably not actually like you know

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:30.630
in my genetics maybe it is in my

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.240
genetics a little bit to have a a

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:35.970
preference for like you know breads and

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.950
dairy products but probably actually

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:39.150
just the way that I grew up I don't know

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:43.290
about you guys but I have this feeling

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:44.700
like in North America like every

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.230
generation we've gotten better at

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.820
cooking I don't know if that's true in

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:51.080
other parts of the world but you know

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:54.210
Canada's a young country all right my

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.790
the way my grandparents told stories of

00:34:54.210 --> 00:35:00.360
what their parents cooked it was like

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:03.990
hey we boiled like a pork hock and then

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:07.130
served it with raw corn next to it and

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:09.930
then my grandparents when they cooked I

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:11.520
didn't even if I did not eat these as a

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:13.050
kid I wouldn't know they existed and I

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.090
actually like me because I hate them so

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.720
much as a kid I like them but it's a

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.330
little weird

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.430
my grandmother is like number one meal

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.870
that she cooked would be like ham

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:25.100
nothing wrong with ham

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:28.860
but then as a side there would be like

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:30.720
these potatoes that came in a can and

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.490
then you baked them but they're kind of

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.140
like already boiled they're like power

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.330
boiled potatoes or something this is

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:40.530
like precooked potatoes that you bake in

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:43.110
the oven my parents you know they're

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:46.830
part of the radical generation that came

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:49.500
after that by the way on my on my

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:52.620
father's side my grandmother's meal was

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.690
like boiled hot dogs wrapped in white

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.430
bread because there's no hot dog buns

00:35:54.690 --> 00:36:00.120
and then like a can of coca-cola classic

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:02.100
but um my parents started getting a like

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.930
you know world foods to some extent so

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.990
it's pretty radical but my grandparents

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:09.300
standards you know they're eating rice

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:13.560
pretty wild right you can tell how

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:16.380
monocultures my my family is as we go

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.240
back here but you know so we would eat

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.820
things like maybe the Indian food and

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.560
Korean my mom eats sushi even though my

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.450
dad thinks the idea of sushi is a little

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.160
weird you know they're like the little

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:29.100
one more step towards progressive and

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.210
then with me it's taking a step back and

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.640
that's because I'm even

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:35.859
ham and sliced cheese rolled up with a

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.359
little bit of Nando's extra hot piri

00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:39.490
piri sauce see it's a little a little

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:41.560
bit of a callback there that's what we

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:43.270
call a punchline the structured joke

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.920
it's pretty rare in this business from

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.380
yours truly thank you for the spirit

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:50.349
heart but no I think that's true you

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:54.820
know I'll eat anything now you know deep

00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:57.040
fried pig's head I lived in Korea we I

00:36:54.820 --> 00:37:00.550
wouldn't say all the time but frequently

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.290
we just as a side dish you know you know

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:06.580
the idea is you go to a bar in America

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:10.210
they'll have like nuts some places in

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:13.240
Korea have insects called bunde eggie

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:15.220
which are like little meal worm pupae we

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.170
just eat those they taste like garbage I

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.869
ate them cuz I didn't want to be seen as

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:23.220
unworldly I fancy myself a little you

00:37:19.869 --> 00:37:26.619
know world traveling Anthony Bourdain

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:29.109
they're garbage don't eat them some of

00:37:26.619 --> 00:37:30.820
you are like but they have less

00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:33.160
environmental impact than meat

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:35.920
that's very true you can still get a lot

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.010
of protein out of an insect but they

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.710
taste like it tastes like dirt that's

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:44.170
fine if we go through an apocalypse I'm

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:45.820
an easygoing dude if we go through an

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.470
apocalypse there's like a nuclear winter

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:51.070
and we have to eat crickets to survive

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:53.920
I'll eat the crickets that's it's gonna

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:56.520
be bad for my morale but I'll do it I'll

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.520
suck it up

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:04.450
but as enjoying the the pleasures of not

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:07.210
having to eat insects right now is very

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:09.369
positive in my opinion all right

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:11.650
great work team down to the next floor

00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:14.440
we this is the right way right like

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:17.530
we've already done yeah is the right way

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.839
oh so that's the problem we unlocked the

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:23.020
razor blade for Eve before we unlock the

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:25.780
razor blade as an item so that's an

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.130
interesting one that's pretty much trash

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.990
yeah we're going the right way we're

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.460
going the right way all we need to do is

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:32.190
get greedy or mode done with Eve and

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.020
then we're set

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:36.030
I don't know if that is it's like that

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.319
in other countries cuz I feel like when

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:41.520
I hear people from other countries talk

00:38:37.319 --> 00:38:43.920
sometimes they're like you know this is

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.710
my great great great great grandmother's

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.700
you know sausage penne recipe passed

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:56.099
down from like the Genoa region northern

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:58.410
Italy or something like that and I know

00:38:56.099 --> 00:38:59.819
when I lived in Korea sometimes you this

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.589
is like an anecdote that happened to me

00:38:59.819 --> 00:39:02.670
once but you know talked to people who

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:04.140
were a little older and they'd be like

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.940
yeah kids these days just even though

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.730
you know North American food like

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.770
McDonald's and Pizza Hut and they were

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:16.500
like they're losing the touch with the

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:18.780
Korean food I feel like North American

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.809
food has gotten better I eat a lot of

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.160
boiled meats as a kid maybe I was just

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:26.220
buying the times that he grows I grew up

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.950
in a rural area well I mean I'd told you

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:31.170
like I went I lived next to a farm and

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:32.849
the people who owned the farm had a

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.890
child who was one year younger than me

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:37.589
so by virtue of the fact that we lived

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:39.630
close together we had to be friends even

00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:41.160
though like we'd share no mutual

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:43.230
interests I wished him nothing but the

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.910
best but you know it was it was a

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:47.039
friendship of circumstance and that's

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.450
fine went over to his house for lunch

00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:50.309
one day he's like hey you want you want

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.170
one of these I said what is it I look at

00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:53.039
it it's a hotdog bun with Miracle Whip

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:57.299
in it that's it

00:39:53.039 --> 00:40:01.950
No thank you sir I will I will stay

00:39:57.299 --> 00:40:04.700
hungry and that's okay you know some

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.700
people might be into that

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:17.570
don't get me I just you know what now

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.490
that I think about it

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:24.240
have I become that which I that which I

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:25.470
hate if I had a child and their friend

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.750
came over I'd be like hey you want one

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.370
they're like what is it oh it's just a

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:34.470
little sliced ham with cheese inside

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:37.470
some Nando's piri-piri extra hot dude

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:39.660
some others snobby youtuber telling the

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.280
story like the year 2040 no he went over

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.730
to my friends house he was just eating

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.560
lunch meat straight out of the bag what

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:48.540
a weirdo this is this was a weird

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.700
episode for commentary it's also like

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:53.670
the longest Isak episode we've had in

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.320
what feels like years and I'm happy with

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:58.080
that dude we got a lot accomplished here

00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.060
we never got absurdly overpowered we

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.910
just dark bomb basically allowed us to

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:08.790
ball out because we have like enough HP

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:11.490
to do whatever the heck we want excuse

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:12.720
me sir um if we could take a bunch of

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.250
damage I think we actually played

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.230
relatively well you know I was hoping to

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:17.880
get into today's episode get off on a

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.170
little bit of zany commentary whether or

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.460
not it involved Michael hands Seuss

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.350
either way it's okay by me

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.880
I think we've accomplished that goal I

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:27.510
hope you guys had a nice little sojourn

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:29.700
