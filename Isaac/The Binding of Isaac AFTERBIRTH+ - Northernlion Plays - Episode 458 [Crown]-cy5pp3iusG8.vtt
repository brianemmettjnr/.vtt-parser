00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.419
hey everybody welcome back to during the

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
lion plays The Binding of Isaac after

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.960
birth plus I'm sitting up like a good

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.710
boy because my neck hurts

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.389
I got like positively British posture

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.039
right now manners maketh man um many

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.960
people perhaps will watch this and go

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.640
your neck still hurts I'm recording this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.060
like 20 minutes after the last episode

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.750
don't sweat it do we have to mom let's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.220
still keep ur greed run we still need to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
unlock the loss but until then this will

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.860
be the last greed run we ever have to do

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:40.140
here's our seed 1 never 9 + P 7 get a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.530
little HP right off the bat not useful

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.629
yet possibly useful soon though and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.140
let's see what we got in here if we can

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.210
manage to get swallowed penny then that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.719
demon judgment provides us with like an

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.629
outrageous amount of value so what's the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.210
game plan pretty simple you know I'm not

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.739
sure if greed as the keeper is any

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
easier or any harder than any other

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.979
character will get HP back every single

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.140
wave and will also generate quite a lot

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.159
of money

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.869
doubtlessly I mean we be odd 's have

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.610
been forever in our favor so far but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
well it will earn a lot of money

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.439
regardless just from even the expected

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.580
value of once every two waves giving us

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.900
a single penny you know it's probably

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.119
like an extra item or two over the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.920
course of the full run even if we only

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.390
get pennies we've already gotten one

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.159
nickel so I don't know if it's any

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.420
easier or harder I probably say it's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.310
it's easier to win greed as the keeper

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.500
then to win a normal run as the keeper

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.590
just keeping in mind that every time we

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.899
get hit we do have to spend a little

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
money on it which is unfortunate we

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.570
could also like much more easily step on

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.570
the button

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.310
but I'd really prefer not to have to

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:08.950
we should have Oh Lord this is too many

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.950
enemies I don't want to use my bomb oh

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.890
it's a dang nightmare anyway we're gonna

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.690
strengthen up somehow

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.090
after toughening up we're then going

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.430
this is stupid

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.890
after toughening up we're gonna oh

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.500
you're a real boy please no

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.880
after toughening up we're gonna hope to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.459
get a one heart deal with the devil so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.810
that we can actually take the HP upgrade

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.640
meaningfully instead of just getting

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.080
nothing of value out of it whatsoever

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.030
I think there's a decent chance that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.110
could come true obviously to HP deals

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.850
are just not doable

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.200
I actually feel okay about the way that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.310
we played here but you know I could

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.250
understand if you watch this and you

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.810
went what is wrong with you sir thank

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.600
you for your politeness by the way I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.860
think I am at a cerbai stage judging by

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.049
my neck pain right now none of this is

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.049
really good enough to get stoked over

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:21.320
freaky please that is not a freaky I

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.870
really want to go for like a reroll

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.730
machine I can't imagine that being good

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.980
for business right now let's buy a key

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.019
get sack dagger this is an outrageously

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.940
useful item thank you so much for your

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:41.480
help so because our deal with the devil

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.060
is not at all dependent on us avoiding

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.250
taking damage I'm gonna be using sac

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.290
dagger to an outrageous degree because

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.390
it's a dream crusher now we should not

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.799
have taken all that money cuz I could

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.410
have used that for HP right there know

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.200
Krampus pls no Krampus but also no items

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.780
so our HP fundamentally useless unless

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.550
that was an HP downgrade or that one

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.350
which it was okay I mean should I be

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.010
happy with this

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.600
I got my HP back and we know there's an

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.920
HP downgrade in the pool which is great

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.130
because it could eventually be an HP

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.820
upgrade but for now I think we'll use a

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.010
bomb and we'll take pay-to-play which is

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.410
a little bit of money but predominantly

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.490
the strength here is definitely the fact

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.050
that we'll never have to buy a key again

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.430
yeah I can live with this we could have

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.590
also gone for like the Wooden Nickel

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.140
play it could have given us a nickel

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.620
which could have given us BFF if we'd

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.000
wanted to purchase it anything funny all

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.410
right that probably was the right play

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.510
then don't really care about a range

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.230
upgrade but let's get this let's get

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.200
this show on the road

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.110
actually you know what let's see if we

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.450
can buy anything first

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.830
we don't need keys we don't really want

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.330
to donate money to try to get HP so we I

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.040
mean out of these we probably would be

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.830
looking at a rear ol more so than

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.660
anything else but you know meat not

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.100
necessarily a zero out of ten you might

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.630
think I'm disappointed but the existence

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.910
of a health downgrade is actually very

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.990
positive for us right now it means we

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:20.530
could take a deal with the devil for

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.670
free I am an actual idiot I actually

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.710
just facepalms

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.540
in real life my neck ooh dmq AJ 9dq we

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.400
did we were stacked why not just pick up

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.400
the money if you're fool ya idiot

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.990
hairpin bosses charge you

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:45.550
but like in the good way right um its

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.320
use a bomb it's pretty much the best

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.830
return on our investment we could have

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.420
hoped for

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.440
grab this I've got an idea it's kind of

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.000
a bad idea

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.410
cuz now that I think about it it's a

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.900
horrible idea what I was gonna do is use

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:03.190
the money from here to get the demon

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.270
judgment to pay out with something why

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.950
is it a terrible idea

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.690
cuz it's basically the same as a regular

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.030
judgment except with a different item

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.420
pool when you consider the fact that

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.000
we're using money to play the deal

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.930
that's not a great setup for us I think

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.810
now remember you know that items so far

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.400
have not been great I'm a little salty

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.350
that we just left our last run without

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.560
you know getting any advantages out of

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.270
it

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.700
there could be a situation we basically

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.220
spend one cent to step on the button if

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.630
stepping on the button though and maybe

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.490
it's more than one salmon opportunity

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.440
cost but if stepping on the button keeps

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.540
us from picking up you know two cents to

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.130
heal up then I think that that's well

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.660
worth it we're gonna leave one cent on

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.840
the ground and see if we can maybe get

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:52.410
it tears upgrade seems viable blood clot

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.410
could be worth it

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.230
I'm not sure how it works with triple

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.450
shot I'm gonna assume the answer is that

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.950
it does and I just don't need to know

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:04.300
the specifics it's not gonna get enough

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.460
money to buy anything else on this floor

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.350
unless we get a really lucky payout wow

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.880
that was bad unless we get a really

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.980
lucky payout so I wouldn't sweat that

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.310
too much just yet we had the perfect

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:18.370
storm on our last floor so it bums me

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.470
out is that I had kind of through a

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.870
combination of cleverness and quite a

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.700
lot of luck if I'm being honest created

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.440
a situation that was way better than it

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.480
had any right to bead right off the bat

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:34.300
on an otherwise fairly vanilla keeper

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:41.020
run - hello - squander that makes me a

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:46.600
very sad boy wow it worked never should

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:48.280
have but here we are so you might get

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.660
enough money to like buy a key if

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.990
there's a three cent key I'll just pick

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:57.730
one up pretty much right now

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:59.110
no three cent key you know what we're

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.760
actually gonna get enough money to buy

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:05.410
something do we want to buy a blood clot

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:07.450
I kind of feel like for greed obviously

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.950
finding like a way to just win the games

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.940
is pretty good

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.260
so really we're looking for the same

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.020
things that we'd be looking for with any

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.610
other character particularly swallowed

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.810
penny like nun's habit I don't think is

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.910
that valuable cuz we're already getting

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.230
a lot of coins on pretty much every wave

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.060
so I don't think we need that as much

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.860
but to be able to play like a demon

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.040
judgment endlessly for free would be

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.289
pretty sweet and also to have a coin

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.330
presumably appear pretty close to us

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:38.620
when we get hit would be good a d20

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.150
might well now we don't really want to

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.960
do 20 cuz we want to keep Wooden Nickel

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:48.430
probably we also need something that

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.990
gives us the ability to win without the

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.020
existence of

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.400
the standard style of green like a big

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.810
room that has a lot of enemies in it

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.820
because we have to fight greed at some

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:03.430
point so it would be better for us maybe

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.430
to get just unbelievably strong damage

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.640
leave a leave a coin just in case I

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.050
think and then come back here and look

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.760
at this we got a lot of bombs so like

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.950
blood clot could be good but I'm looking

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.140
for something a little better and none

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.390
of this fits the bill that's fine we got

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.640
this with the bombs are for black candle

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.860
I don't think it's worth it we can't

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.080
benefit from the spear of the hearts I

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.690
mean thunder thighs is not worth it

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:37.460
especially with poor speed but if we get

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:39.590
an unbelievably useful item from our

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:44.120
deal with the devil we might be

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:46.010
interested like if we get a brimstone or

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.420
something then I think we've got to pay

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.880
more attention to the idea of taking

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.870
thunder thighs no Brimstone's to HP we

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.520
can't take it to begin with

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.080
ok disregard it have to be an amazing

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:59.750
one hard deal and I can't even imagine

00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:02.090
what that would be at this point we

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:05.200
could take nine lives then brimstone but

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.490
we're kind of getting into you know

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.600
ridiculous territory if that happens

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.010
we'll cross that bridge when we come to

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.110
it for now that bridge doesn't even

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.330
exist it's like you know when people say

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:17.060
hey if you believe that I got a bridge I

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.710
want to sell you that's the bridge we're

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.140
talking about that bridge don't exist at

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.710
least not yet but if we build it they

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:27.170
will come

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:28.400
feel the dreams good movie well I don't

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.830
know what it is with greed mode we have

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.880
a tendency to not get very good deals

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.060
with a devil right off the bat

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.800
unfortunately frees us up to use our

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.380
bombs for this though yeah we'll take

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.000
sin toil no problem and we'll get the

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.240
heck out of here we need more damage

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.390
because the more damage we have the

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.130
better

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:50.840
please be small rock with with more

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.280
damage will clear waves faster which

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.690
means we'll make more money which means

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.430
we have more money on the ground for HP

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.440
and also we can buy more things which

00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.590
inevitably is what carries us to

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.390
greatness so it's basically a 10-cent

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.500
pick up there and forever alone is fine

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.500
not against that

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:12.480
obviously I've got an eye towards the

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.980
beelzebub transformation but um I don't

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.060
know maybe hive mind works towards that

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:19.410
I can't recall for now though just see

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.940
if we can get through this wave you know

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.820
we got a lot of flies backing us up our

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:29.540
damage is a little bit better now no

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:35.089
guarantees never gonna be able to uh

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:38.459
there's a hidden enemy where are you oh

00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:40.920
he was in the middle of the coins sneaky

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:42.000
sneaky no guarantees we'll be able to

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.470
get through this without having to touch

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.620
the button but again touching the button

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:51.620
doesn't really matter much yet

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.819
try not to waste any plays here you know

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.350
that there is like a mass effect you

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:05.240
want to use the you want to use the

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.800
Wooden Nickel as much as possible in

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:13.970
order to create a situation in which you

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:16.639
get the maximum value help we've made it

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:19.759
and we got through this only taking one

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:21.170
damage so it's like a win-win sleeve a

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:26.209
little bit of money on the ground for

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:28.579
now like that maybe cuz we have a full

00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:32.810
reroll here do we want a hive mind I

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:36.079
don't think we need it we I'm gonna take

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:38.149
box because the idea here is we at least

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:41.420
get a bomb a key in a penny a tarot card

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:43.850
that could be useful a pill that turned

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.860
out to be useful and I mean Blacktooth

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.019
occasionally might be OK for us

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.269
I think it's an OK value and then we're

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:52.279
gonna say goodbye hivemind a tears

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:58.670
upgrade for a shot speed downgrade I

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:59.779
actually like but I want to I want to

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.550
see if we get a deal with the devil

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.110
first because we might derive value from

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:08.060
that so we don't need to buy any more

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:13.610
keys we could save our Sun card for a

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:15.889
future floor but I'm not gonna I'm gonna

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:18.430
use it like basically I blew it

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:20.930
no I didn't he still took damage

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:23.980
basically I know this guy's not tanky

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:26.269
he's just annoying in terms of the

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:32.089
prolonged period of invincibility he's

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:33.860
got it's like black tooth is

00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:35.389
occasionally we're poisonous or

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.339
occasionally our shots are poisonous

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:40.160
like do we get a we get a bad breath

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:41.779
aura that seems fitting for the name of

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.980
the item or do we get you know

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:44.980
occasionally poison shots

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.110
only time will tell

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.060
again we just don't want to buy the HP

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.100
upgrade until it's clear we can or

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.910
cannot derive maximum value from it and

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:05.779
repeating of course mmm the ayyy talk

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:08.450
nerdy to me we just want to make sure

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:10.970
you know if we can get a devil deal item

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.410
essentially for free absolutely that's

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:16.970
gonna be you know the path we want to

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:19.820
take this one's going okay to who they

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.560
never give me deals in the deal we can

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.070
use on Sue's on Sue's does very little

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.450
for us we could use Yara right now but

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.880
there's not that much money on the

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:32.480
grounds could we'd rather use it all at

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.650
once on like a future floor so do we

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.180
really care that much about its here's

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.100
upgrade we do because we have triple

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.570
shot and that's a pretty big upgrade now

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.770
I'll take a lump of coal as well and

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:45.920
we'll just move along that was like a

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:48.890
pretty solid get there I think so now

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.900
the big play for us is to double as much

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.400
money as possible down here on the

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.839
deficit I think we got a good start here

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.390
anything could happen

00:14:53.839 --> 00:15:01.910
dude mom's wig pretty good

00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:03.830
cat-o'-nine-tails really good another

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.860
syringe might be worth buying we'll also

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:12.760
check the card death card can be worth a

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:16.580
lot right here fool card you know what

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.589
was it worth it one cent for a few flies

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.390
I wouldn't say it wasn't worth it

00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:22.040
because it was technically maybe like

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.660
eight cents because of all not eats it

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.270
technically two cents because of the

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:30.850
doublings we could have had but all

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.850
right let's get this road on the show

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:38.679
actually ok damage out but we should

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:40.209
also not pick up our bombs because in

00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:45.699
case it's not abundantly clear those can

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:48.189
be doubled as well there's probably not

00:15:45.699 --> 00:15:53.230
a world or an alternate you know

00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:54.759
multiverse where I actually use all

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.639
these bombs that were gonna garner here

00:15:54.759 --> 00:16:00.209
clearly our shots are the ones that get

00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:02.949
the poison shot by the way because I

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:05.739
didn't touch that enemy at all and he

00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:07.470
still got poisoned this could be big for

00:16:05.739 --> 00:16:09.369
us we might have found the scene I

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.170
shouldn't say the scene we might have

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:14.110
found all seem because I think every

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.730
green mode run has about 50 if I'm able

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.139
to find one almost every run there's

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.110
probably more than enough let's put it

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:21.279
at that it's a lot of money to be

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:32.860
doubled but there's always more to be

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:34.179
made here Oh kind of a tight dodge range

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.149
is high enough we can keep them at bay I

00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:39.879
think we got pretty lucky there and we

00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:45.549
can double starting essentially right

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:48.269
now what if I can just do exactly the

00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:48.269
same technique

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.620
I don't see him anymore hard to miss but

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:05.290
still might be like my least favorite

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.290
boss in the game picked up two bombs

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:12.800
it's all ruined now not really I don't

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:18.790
want a double yet cuz maybe we can get

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.790
it consumable from the drop here well

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.500
now we can double

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:26.449
I'm figured I might as well wait until

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.960
our final Wooden Nickel play was that a

00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:31.580
little too precious yeah probably

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.120
dude there's like an extra 40 cents

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:39.890
right there in nickels alone I also got

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:41.720
a deal with the angel this isn't bad

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.850
bunch of a seemed like it's funny that

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.530
this looks so dramatic but if we had

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.150
just picked up the dollar we wouldn't

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.760
have been like wow that's amazing we

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.430
would have been like oh cool but to make

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.340
you know 91 cents out of 46 is all of a

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.990
sudden like oh my god sure let's go for

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.820
full deals with the angel we actually

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:04.970
this is more of a seemed we just got a

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:06.260
seven damage up from a single item keep

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.030
in mind we still want to keep money on

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.600
the ground in these situations cuz like

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:13.910
we could still end up taking damage and

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.080
dying even with 15.5 damage so we

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.300
definitely will take a speed upgrade

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.890
that gives us a chance to get spun and

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.690
then apart from that the rest of these

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.400
kind of stink so we're gonna save our

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.020
money for the next shop it's all about

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.150
you know kenny rogers said it best man

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:28.730
know when to hold em know when to fold

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.290
them know when to buy an item know when

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.970
to run you never count your donations

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.900
when you're sittin at the table at the

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.300
time enough for countin when the

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:38.600
dealin's done brother Bobby garbage item

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.890
pants a gram very solid with the damage

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.550
is kind of hitting diminishing returns

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:44.930
but it's still good

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:47.570
we don't need keys so we'll open this

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:51.050
just got flies homing shots should be

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:54.570
good 20 20 should be incredible fire

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:58.600
might stay far far away

00:18:54.570 --> 00:19:00.429
chaos found our secret room as well I

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:05.350
mean I I find it hard to resist the

00:19:00.429 --> 00:19:09.909
$0.07 chaos strength card judgment just

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:11.020
blow up the judgment Fish Head can't see

00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:13.929
that being that useful

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:19.360
we'll start with chaos we definitely do

00:19:13.929 --> 00:19:22.840
not care about placebo $0.07 guppies

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.909
head swing for the moon even if you miss

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.830
you'll land amongst the stars here we

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:29.860
don't need the HP but I'm kind of happy

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:33.669
it exists so the thing is we don't

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:36.610
actually need Wooden Nickel as much as

00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:38.590
we might benefit from having Guppies

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.030
head I think at this point because

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.570
remember we have to fight greed at some

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.780
point anyway

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.950
holy Mansell maybe not that valuable but

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.970
I think it's valuable enough to check

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:52.059
alright

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:54.669
I just think getting three flies per

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:56.770
wave is probably more valuable here the

00:19:54.669 --> 00:20:02.890
end game is to essentially just become

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:04.929
guppy create our own flies at will but

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.190
this is extremely good and we're not

00:20:04.929 --> 00:20:07.659
worried about donating at all you might

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.280
have found yourself asking that question

00:20:07.659 --> 00:20:13.110
and now what about the donations what

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.110
about the donations we're greed my dude

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:21.650
as greed do you worry about donations

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:25.400
now you look out for numero uno how's

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:29.570
thematically fitting all right easy

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:33.190
waves easy life you got 18 damage which

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:35.540
means our flies are doing 36 each

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:39.410
spiders are doing oh wait are they doing

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:41.630
36 are they doing 54 sorry now fish or

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:46.310
are they doing 27 is what I mean to

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:48.350
suggest so spiders two and a half or two

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:51.050
I thought they were two and a half but I

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:52.550
might be wrong maybe flies are one and a

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.170
half and spiders or two it doesn't

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:57.350
matter that much they're doing a lot of

00:20:54.170 --> 00:21:05.090
damage so we should have a decent angel

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:07.070
chance got an HP upgrade but our second

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.900
key piece why take the second key piece

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:12.710
more angel chances in the future I guess

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:15.170
is the be honest answer strength card is

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.090
valuable after we get hit once but first

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.720
give me guppy please Guppies caller

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:22.730
that's very good

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:25.730
now do we need Guppies head no but we

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:29.750
don't need very much of anything at all

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:31.660
do we think we'd rather keep it then

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:34.820
have the chance to get one extra penny I

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.290
don't know maybe maybe not our best

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.350
strategy is definitely gonna be just

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.910
like not getting hit against greed but

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.050
obviously like that's easier said than

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.370
done that being said we do have another

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.380
floor before we have to worry about

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:49.370
things experimental treatment is very

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:51.800
dangerous so so what do you do try to

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.360
get mr. me to steal an item for you I

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.810
always use this item wrong but you know

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.810
what

00:21:53.810 --> 00:22:00.530
please take BFF for me

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:03.350
hey he's done it because there's an HP

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:04.790
upgrade I am gonna go for spun because

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.890
we can just buy the HP upgrade if we

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.600
lose HP which we did but we did also

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:12.410
everything else went up except for shout

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:14.630
speed which is extremely who cares so

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:16.480
we'll go back to full HP and this is

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.100
probably where we stop for now

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.780
we have the strength card to bail

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:24.190
ourselves out but it'd be much better if

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:27.580
we didn't have to pretty fortuitous HP

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.990
plays here and pleased with the way

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.450
these are going it's been kind of like a

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.280
commentary focus run like a like

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.410
strategy focus commentary would be a

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.710
better way to describe it but dude look

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:40.870
at the run we've ended up creating

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:43.560
instead of shooting three shots with a

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:45.910
fire rate of 30 something for 28 I think

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.010
we're shooting five shots with a fire

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:55.090
rate of 11 and two two point two two

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:57.460
damage plus four guffy so the one thing

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:59.110
I'll acquiesce it would have been nice

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.700
this is a proper use of acquiesce so

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:05.230
I'll accept no aggravation the one thing

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.630
I like we yes we should have taken

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:12.820
hivemind we didn't I

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:16.030
cares about that right there um first

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:20.170
off give me coins please since there's

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:22.840
coins if we sleep in this they won't

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.940
even let us we didn't oh holy Mantha we

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.830
didn't get hit at all on that floor good

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.970
lord

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:32.200
we're just gonna move on and the reason

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:33.490
we're gonna move on is because we can

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.990
use our money on the next floor instead

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.400
again we've already donated a max we

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:42.010
don't need to donate anymore this is

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:46.450
good we are already flying and

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:51.220
pay-to-play doesn't give us much so the

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:52.780
pact is solid little day Oh big rate of

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.970
fire increase I'm not reroll in this run

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.970
not as the keeper have mercy

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:04.930
we don't need a bookworm

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:11.620
Wow Sacred Heart just gave us a plus 30

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:13.780
damage upgrade take conehead which also

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.100
works is like an infamy substitute plus

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:20.200
we look like we're wearing a beanie or

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:23.610
something probably goes without saying

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.610
but runs pretty good

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.370
some of the weirdest-looking shots I've

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.990
ever seen we got to watch out for

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.930
enemies that can hit us from afar but

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:41.480
like apart from that we're doing 54

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:44.390
damage kind of on the ridiculous side

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.160
like crown of light Plus Sacred Heart is

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:53.300
just about as lucky as you can ever

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:55.550
expect again it might be a good time to

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.230
put in like a photosensitivity warning

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.960
things are flashing pretty fast here

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:03.830
it'll get worse if we get sad bombs god

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:05.990
willing but oh I lost my holy mantle

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:09.380
charge so now we've got to be the very

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:11.540
slightest bit careful and I mean we

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:17.960
can't really take much advantage out of

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:20.510
this but there you go we can buy

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.250
probably one more item and the strength

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:25.760
card is there to bail us out if we if we

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:27.170
get hit twice on the next floor so we

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.460
might be able to sneak two items out of

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:34.030
here certainly nine lives you can make a

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:36.620
case but it's not what I'm looking for

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:41.990
we don't need HP we already have two

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:44.300
trinkets everything else is pretty honor

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.700
oh okay we don't need Guppies head cuz

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.220
we're gonna take book of Belial and get

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.600
like a little damage upgrade and then is

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.840
there anything else we want with 16

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:56.600
cents you almost like might as well buy

00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:00.790
something but what actually all of this

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.790
is garbage I'm excited

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.860
actually just terrible give me the heck

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.470
out of here dude

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.330
I'm excited might've like potholed this

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:20.140
whole run is that a word that makes any

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:22.090
sense in this context I don't know I'm

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.700
just gonna hope the answers yes this guy

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:29.050
might start moving pretty darn fast pop

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:31.090
this we get up to 62 damage I don't know

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.860
he's eating it pretty quickly here this

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.330
is like before many of the Flies have

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:40.180
even had a chance to make it over there

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:43.860
and we stole my god he's excited

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.860
we still have holy mantle popping

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.680
strange way to describe a passive item

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:52.630
that protects you from taking damage Wow

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.700
it's like actually may be the strongest

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:59.080
run I've ever had we get rid of greed

00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:04.000
it's okay well why don't you name what

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:06.160
it does NL no shop keeper in the shop no

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.380
no no greed boy in the shop I think it's

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.730
the answer so we could have gotten a 90

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.440
for damage but I was really saving the

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.920
strength card for like an HP injection

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.270
when necessary either way why donate why

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.110
not is the answer I'm gonna give you

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.010
thanks for watching hope you guys

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.970
enjoyed it if you think click the like

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.780
button upset a great deal of course

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.010
subscribe if you wanna see more in the

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.510
future for now thanks for watching and I
