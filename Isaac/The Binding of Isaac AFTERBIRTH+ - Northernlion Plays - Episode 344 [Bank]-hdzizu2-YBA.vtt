00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.560
hey everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.370
after birth plus Mayweather McGregor

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
what could be better

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.610
oh good damage could write a fire good

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.869
speed bad HP we suffered the map and the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.529
clicker J 1 &amp; 4 1 X H 3 I don't like

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.449
this because you're darned if you do

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.039
you're darned if you don't if you're

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.039
don't you're darn if you do you're darn

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.099
if you don't what I mean by that is the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.210
clicker if you use it you make your run

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.829
worse for no reason and if you don't use

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
it

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.700
everyone goes what a little baby you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.610
didn't use an item hey what a little

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.530
baby he didn't eat poison lady poison

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.570
was the worst that can happen there's

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.230
some good effects to poison sometimes

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.980
you know like I just please oh Jesus

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.879
Christ

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.760
I would rather here's my gamble with you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.920
guys I'd rather take glass freakin

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.600
cannon he's bad it's not at all good but

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.740
I would rather take glass cannon than

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.049
then the clicker sure we could reroll

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.240
into dark Judas but the fact that it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.549
takes items away means that on average

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
was the expected number of items lost

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.780
before we turn into dark Judas tool

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.329
freakin many I refuse now glass cannon

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.670
I'm probably just like I do want to use

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.970
it but the run we have had one run and I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.979
know that's the number because I

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.780
remember the run fairly well we've had

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.659
one run in which glass cannon was

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.270
absurdly good for us it worked out very

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.579
well now what does it take 9 lives would

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.840
help a lot in the like mental game of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.310
trying to make sure that we can make it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.189
happen the other thing is just so much

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.710
damage that glass cannon makes it so

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.390
that everything is for sure going to die

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.380
with a glass cannon hit and you might be

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.580
saying well if you had so much damage

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.050
then even I need glass can in the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.210
beginning but look get your logic out of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.890
here ok this is a no logic zone

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.050
starting now we're going to try to use

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.270
glass cannon and of that you have my

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:28.620
word not my word what an uncouth

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.480
gentleman no but yes it is potion

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.380
sellers potion seller has played by Paul

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:39.570
F Tompkins I just you got to give me a

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.460
little bit of time to enable it because

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.010
like you know that was not worth to an

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.260
Abbe spirits although I will say the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.330
thing with glass cannon is once you use

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.700
it and once you're at half a spirit

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.950
heart you can roll on that level at HP

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.170
forever it's not likely I'm much of a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.570
streak to to save ourselves from right

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.670
now so we might as well just have a good

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:06.150
time here I think but 9lives is the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:12.750
ultimate enabler for this particular

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.520
setup right here because it means that

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.190
even if we take a hit we don't lose the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.980
whole run and by extension the streak

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.230
instead we can actually you know absorb

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.650
a hit from time to time although we'd

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.140
still rather not I imagine most bosses

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.150
will die in one go he just dodged his

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:37.950
enemies or his friends corpse there

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:39.690
that's some metal or could buy a spirit

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.450
heart but a spirit hour doesn't help a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:49.350
1-up health and they say that a 1-up

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:56.760
would save us I am gonna stand here and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:58.560
wait not very good but dude I've never

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.170
felt more like a kindred spirit with

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.320
Michael ale Fox than when he said he saw

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.240
the first spider-man movie because hero

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.960
by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.420
was in it I know we're all oh we all

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.730
have such good taste now dude I was in

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.310
eighth grade when silver side up the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.190
debut album from Nickelback came out I'm

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.480
here to tell you everybody was bumping

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.070
it we didn't have worse taste it's just

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.750
something about

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:35.070
the society that we were in at that in

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.470
that era okay take this for now was

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.000
conducive to letting Nickelback not only

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.680
rise but all ended by the way as I

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.600
recognize that Nickelback they get so

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.510
much hatred and and there in the end

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.640
just a band you know Nickelback is more

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.010
hated than like the world's most corrupt

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.380
politicians which is hilarious but also

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.910
stupid anyway the point is dude thank

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.440
God we got our spirit heart back here so

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.440
we don't have to fight this guy on 1hp

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.860
everybody was bumping silver side up and

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.930
we all loved it we were all like this is

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.240
the best Canadian band in you know years

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.310
of our generation things change you know

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.610
the public perception is turned against

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.150
Nickelback outside of you know Alberta

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.710
no offense meant

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.600
but still you know we were all bumping

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.000
it back then I would definitely I saw

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.320
spider-man in theaters because every one

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.670
of my age of you saw spider-man in

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.330
theaters it had the largest opening

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.910
weekend of any movie for link you know

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.130
it was eventually beaten but I can't

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.330
remember what by I don't think Guppies

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.330
collar that seems smart with glass

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.560
cannon but it opened with like a hundred

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.700
and two million dollars or something

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.910
like that which was unheard of at the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.340
time anyway the point is I saw it and I

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.830
also saw it partly because I'm like that

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.600
song is real good in hindsight I don't

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.210
think I've heard that song in the wild

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.430
in like actually probably at least 13 or

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.280
14 years maybe even a little bit longer

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.020
but that song is falling off the radar

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.570
that's not a timeless classic you know

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.290
you can turn on the radio and hear semi

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.610
charmed

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:15.420
it's said it's so weird I want something

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.540
else to get me through this semi charmed

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.250
kind of life baby baby no but you still

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.040
you're semi charm kind of life on there

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.630
semi charmer life on the radio you still

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.350
here you know the new radicals highly

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.820
underrated classic you get what you give

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.790
don't here hero by Chad Kroeger that

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.730
much you still your bailamos on the

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.320
radio you still here hero by Enrique

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.320
Iglesias on the radio

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:47.339
but Hiro has been maybe it's because

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:49.679
it's so in it like not inexplicably

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.839
inextricably is that the word you know

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:56.639
it's tied to something so much that it

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:57.419
can't be separated from it they're so

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.610
connected

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:02.039
Hiro in the first spider-man movie that

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.719
it's just dated it can't possibly be a

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.809
timeless classic because of the fact

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:08.489
that it's so obviously a time capsule of

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:11.610
a certain period oh no the point is I

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:15.860
didn't mean to start this episode with

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.860
like a treatise on hero by Chad Kroeger

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:25.769
pre it's got some deep lyrics someone

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:26.879
told me love would all save us how could

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:31.259
that be

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:34.439
look what love gave us a wolf aloof

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:36.889
killing in blood spilling that will

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:36.889
never change

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:46.619
geez man I guess you can see why as a 13

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:48.990
year old I was like these guys anybody

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:53.329
anybody ever heard of the modern Beatles

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.329
Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott I

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.479
can't remember that what are the opening

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:02.579
lyrics the hero you got to give me a

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:03.419
second here hero Chad Kroeger chords

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:06.209
lyrics

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:10.829
hero hero featuring Chad Kroeger lyrics

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:13.649
yet oh yeah I'm so high I can hear

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:17.119
heaven I'm so high I can hear heaven

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:19.469
oh but heaven no heaven don't hear me oh

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:21.749
yeah and then I forgot it's got that

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:25.649
like breakdown in the middle now that

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:35.370
the world isn't ending it's not that I'm

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:37.139
sending to you look like the most

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.310
garbage song I've probably listened to

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:39.120
more than anything else in my entire

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:43.560
life

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.939
oh man okay dude I mean how can i I want

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.880
to be on your side here okay I want to

00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:50.710
say knit up first off I'm having a

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.080
mental freaking breakdown

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.570
/ remembering how bad hero actually is a

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.150
song despite the fact that I'd loved it

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.950
and you know I didn't buy it I'm

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.500
probably downloaded it but downloaded it

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.910
off of like you know cuz I'll light or

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.190
something like that I'm not ashamed to

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.810
admit it the statute look Chad Kroeger

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.990
if you watch this video I'll send you a

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.370
dollar fifty okay and that's y'all said

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.600
you four dollars because it would have

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:17.980
been a dollar back in like the year 2000

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.480
which you know with inflation we're

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.100
probably talking you're up in the two to

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.170
50 range and then let's build in like a

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.790
little punitive damages as well because

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:29.860
I think you're hurting right now

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:31.690
not but anyway the point is still I hate

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.060
sauerkraut it's really what I'm trying

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.500
to say here

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:39.910
okay we've used so many keys people to

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:41.740
shop oh that's not bad so we should play

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:45.610
this we have two HP I think so we should

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.050
play this twice try to leverage this for

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.060
a little bit more of an advantage and

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:55.360
grab this and then we could play a once

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:58.560
at least maybe twice there's a lot of

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.300
songs like that I mean I'm not gonna

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:07.480
again I always want to preface this kind

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:10.450
of scary I was on a preface this kind of

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.740
conversation with hating on other people

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.170
for their musical tastes as a young

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.060
man's game there's so much more oh my

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.730
god wait until you commute you're gonna

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.890
lose it you know I don't like this

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.250
person because they think you know Pablo

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:26.440
honey is the best okay computer album

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.150
you don't even understand the the level

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.310
of hate that can course through your

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.510
body for like to kill your turn signals

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:36.540
that's what they're there for

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:39.540
dude this is a cruel boss right here but

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.540
still

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:47.230
I grew up in an era that was not great

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.670
for me we may die here I grew up in an

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.940
area that was not great for music and

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:55.240
I'll just admit it and it wasn't just me

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:58.270
like I can all take some ownership and

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:03.820
be like yeah me too but it was not just

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:04.410
me everyone was bump and Creed straight

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.910
up

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.560
everyone was bump and Nickelback back in

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:12.700
the day we were in eighth grade we got

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:17.140
some Reno we got a good excuse I should

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:18.940
say but at the same time you know it it

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.470
was a dark era for modern music and

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.029
that's why I've gone on this tangent

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.170
many times the videos saying like I

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:25.839
don't understand people in my generation

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.670
that are like well kids these days

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:29.950
listen to Justin Bieber back in my day

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.650
we had nickel I mean but also we had

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:38.650
Creed I mean okay but then we actually

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:43.420
got HP Wow okay well yeah yeah yeah

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:45.130
we'll go we'll go void we went empty

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.710
vessel as well we'll go void and suck up

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.020
that right there and I'm like an

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:54.430
extremely happy camper

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:55.600
I will go back for the curse room and

00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:00.100
see what we got in there that take a sip

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.750
of this coffee every generation has

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.120
garbage artists that rise to the top how

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.760
are you think about Justin Bieber's most

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.980
recent singles actually we're pretty

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.839
good from a pop music standpoint but you

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.190
know maybe not everybody agrees with me

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:16.450
I don't know it's been a while since I

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.950
read pitchfork media you can tell I'm og

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:22.810
though because that's the original URL

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:25.000
dawg it's no pitchfork com this is

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.980
pitchfork media Ryan Schreiber did he

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.620
really give odelay a ten out of ten yeah

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:33.580
it deserved it at the time okay we might

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:36.010
as well suck these bad boys up no we

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.870
might as well never touch empty vessel

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.550
at 90 vessel glass can and again as long

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.260
as we live so we've made some Zane

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:46.029
happen here and I respect and appreciate

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:48.610
that anyway I'm trying to think who else

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:51.070
we had

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.260
some artists from that era have gone on

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:56.920
to become timeless whether or not you

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:59.470
like them Coldplay for example continues

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.860
at least in my estimation to be one of

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:07.779
the biggest bands in the world I am no

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:10.029
huge fan of Coldplay Kanye West again

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:13.269
continues to be one of the biggest acts

00:13:10.029 --> 00:13:16.240
in the world I quite like the music of

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:18.940
Kanye West and to be honest with you I

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.079
don't feel the need to say you know well

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.970
I don't agree with him on a personal

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:24.010
level but I like his music you know he

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.959
far as I'm concerned he's he's an artist

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.579
he produces a product and you know I

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:29.410
listened to that product can't always

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:31.690
separate the art from the artist if

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.279
you're like you know like if you met

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.920
someone and they were like you know I

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:38.050
know he's not a good guy but you really

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.670
got to check out this painting from

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.560
Hitler like that's for you be like you

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.240
know what I think I'm just gonna pass

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.630
plenty of artists out there for me but

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:49.450
you know Kanye Webb strikes me as kind

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:52.779
of like a delusional genius and if we're

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:55.390
gonna start you know holding people over

00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:57.279
the coals for that you know you guys you

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.970
got to start you're gonna find a lot of

00:13:57.279 --> 00:14:03.480
media problematics all I'm suggesting

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:07.420
you know yeah John Lennon hit his wife

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:10.390
you know we go back all the Beethoven

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.649
probably like you know stab the dude in

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.779
the heart for his lunch money or

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:16.420
something you know you gotta go to

00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:18.940
evaluate it with the times well maybe

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.950
not I don't know it's the general gist

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.420
of every NL bit by the end of it I don't

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.339
really know do whatever you want to do

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.260
see if I care while you're watching the

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:27.820
videos and as long as you find these

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.170
entertaining that's the most important

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:33.910
thing I mean I really just handle my own

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:35.440
garden for the most part oh I really

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.649
wish we could get our damage up a little

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.649
higher

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.640
we're very lucky to be in the position

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.610
we're in on this run I mean we dodged

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.200
the clicker by using glass cannon we use

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.790
the glass cannon which means that we've

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.440
absolved ourselves of some of the anti

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:53.580
Zain of having it but not touching it

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.310
and then we've ended up here getting

00:14:53.580 --> 00:15:00.420
kind of gifted and amazing item in the

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:07.860
form of the void with the a good book

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:15.690
sucked up as well there we go so I mean

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:17.250
the shop is interesting to me not

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.980
interesting enough for me to spend a key

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.690
at the well no we should here we get we

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.240
got time to possibly make boss rush no

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.400
greed please thank you I don't know why

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:33.420
I said it is if I'm singing a song

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:36.630
singing a song there's options you oh

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.400
well worth it we're going to keep the

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.810
Hermit card for boss rush potentiality

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.210
we've had so many runs recently that

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.650
have been like just shy of making it the

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.000
boss rush and then we finish the rest of

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.640
the run in four minutes that I want to

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.620
avoid it I want to I want to nip that in

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.030
the bud if possible I don't really I'm

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.580
trying to think of other artists from my

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:56.810
era that we're huge and have stuck

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.810
around because there are some

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.910
what about the Beatles you look do I

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:08.199
strike use a 75 year old man I like the

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.839
Beatles in fact I think you know

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:12.610
Revolver Rubber Soul Sgt pepper's Lonely

00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:15.069
Hearts Club Band to a lesser extent

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.480
Abbey Road magical mystery tour and with

00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:18.790
the Beatles of some of the best albums

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:23.500
ever made but it's not my that's not

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:25.269
contemporaneous you know crazy town's

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:28.899
butterfly look now you're just

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:30.970
consulting me such a sexy sexy pretty

00:16:28.899 --> 00:16:32.680
little thing and that's when she got me

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.660
sprung with her tongue ring now I ain't

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.220
gonna lie diddle oven gets me high to

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.069
keep you by my side there's nothing that

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:42.240
I won't try it's very troubling lyrics

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:42.240
on many different levels

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:47.800
take left speedball I'm okay with that I

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.139
could use the speed and I will take

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.699
duality although not thrilled with it

00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:54.610
you know what there's an easy way let's

00:16:51.699 --> 00:16:55.899
just go top songs of 2000 and then

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.949
there's going to be some here that I'm

00:16:55.899 --> 00:17:02.740
going to have forgotten about I'm sure

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:09.370
Oh - don't you go I got a feeling the

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:15.640
Black Eyed Peas 1999 excuse me I don't

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:20.520
think so um Bad Romance Lady gaga 1999

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.780
oh don't think that that's true

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.909
kryptonite buy three doors down now

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.909
we're talking but I've already I've gone

00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:28.470
off on on three DD Triple D as I call

00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:34.919
them

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:38.490
Guy Fieri be darned today you know what

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:38.490
let's get some Intel

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.390
I don't I don't think kryptonite is a

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.070
great song but I don't hate it here

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.630
without you I actually think is one of

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.910
the worst songs has ever made it into

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.280
the public zeitgeist but you know I

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.110
recognize that a lot of people actually

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.880
really like that song the only reason

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:58.360
that I even bring it up is because it

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.640
has like infinity trillion views on

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:04.000
YouTube we do want to suck that up if

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.650
possible so you know that's you in a way

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.500
it is it that I only hate it because

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:10.660
it's popular no I hate it because I've

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.350
heard it 39,000 times that I didn't like

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.960
it to begin with

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.310
and then the reason I've heard is thirty

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.870
nine thousand times because it's popular

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.070
and I you know used to take the school

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.530
bus to school for forty-five minutes

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:25.020
each way so yeah now you get a great

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:30.790
feeling from what's what's what's hot

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:33.360
hair through but that's that's one of

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:36.460
those songs you think you want to avoid

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.110
great damage there one of those songs

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.250
you want to avoid railing on too hard

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.530
because like there's probably people

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.180
watching this for whom that was like you

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:48.550
know their wedding first dance or

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:50.470
something look Ian Dan Lu stop leave

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:54.250
Shakira alone underneath your clothes

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:58.830
isn't that bad of a song I need your

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:58.830
clothes there's an endless a sorry

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.080
yeah it's a great song about how nice

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:08.250
her partner looks naked

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.250
it's very heartfelt

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:16.470
I still think that for that the one that

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:18.270
even as like a ninth grade child in this

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.600
song you never you're dirty by Christina

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:22.740
Aguilera anymore like that one has is

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.660
exited public consciousness

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:28.200
we got a year of and just double /

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:30.240
through or maybe that wasn't year as

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.800
long as exited public consciousness but

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.490
another song from that album is stuck

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:38.280
around you see you are beautiful no

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.050
matter what this and he was wrong

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.860
bring you down it's like that song has

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:47.070
got a good message but it's really weird

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:51.210
to me that as you know even even as a

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:54.210
teenager track one wanna get dirty it's

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.790
about time for my arrival image you know

00:19:54.210 --> 00:20:00.750
track to you are beautiful no matter

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:04.320
what they see this it's exactly the same

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:08.240
phenomenon as no scrubs vs. unpretty by

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:11.520
TLC first song is like you know I'm a

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.680
self-confident modern independent woman

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.180
and don't step to me unless you got the

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.440
same things going on in a man and

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.020
there's nothing wrong with that message

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.400
but then track 2 is like you know the

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:29.280
media is trying to undermine my

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:31.260
confidence so you are the media there's

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.940
a lack of self-awareness there I'm not

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.370
saying you can't have both messages

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.320
going on I'm just saying you know it

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.270
makes it an album of singles as opposed

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:43.170
to a cohesive work of art by itself I

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.880
don't know if anyone's really looking at

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:47.670
it at that level it might just be me

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.690
being a silly silly dude other songs on

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.250
the list I mean there's like bye-bye

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.360
bye-bye NSYNC I'm gonna be honest with

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.970
you

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.360
NSYNC is made into and well in sync is

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.920
beloved in a pseudo ironic way because

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.680
Justin Timberlake is single-handedly

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.200
like become one of the most likable

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.620
people in the entertainment industry and

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:12.150
I loved NSYNC as a as a teenager in an

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:15.480
adolescent I think that we were

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:17.760
listening to buy buy buy in 1999 or 2000

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.410
and laughing we're like musics never

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.330
going to be as good as this ever again

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.180
when I heard buy buy buy in the grocery

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.430
store of all places

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.380
weeks ago was like this is Congress it's

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.120
actually really bad but I remember be

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:32.270
like all bye bye bye Zhan stop

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.430
everything go watch the video you know

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.410
that's that's going to date our our

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:45.230
growing up if you're roughly the same

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:47.240
age as I am I think like what that would

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.460
be if you were like eight years younger

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.290
than me probably like man I remember

00:21:49.460 --> 00:22:03.740
when little Wayne's lollipop was on the

00:21:51.290 --> 00:22:06.650
radio she wanna lick the wrapper it's

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:11.690
time to stop recording Isaac forever

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:14.840
maybe you start swelling cut the world's

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:17.330
worst little Wayne impression I don't

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.530
you know I don't hear it the same way

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:23.210
that you hear it because in my head

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.410
different because I'm hearing it through

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:28.040
the bones in my head I'm actually

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:29.240
lightheaded from laughing at that's nice

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.610
you know when you can make these videos

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.690
and amuse yourself she wanted like the

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.690
rappers Oh

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.670
bye-bye-bye seems very innocent

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.410
when lollipop went to number one this is

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.440
not me hatin on lollipop or Lil Wayne

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:48.370
got a respect - Carter - and the Carter

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:52.910
three things lollipop is a surprisingly

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:57.560
a experimental track to have hit number

00:22:52.910 --> 00:23:00.590
one you know at least advection 18

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.910
standards I know little Wayne is the

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.010
Canadian I'm just saying you know I

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:06.470
don't know what I'm saying we have

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:08.840
quainter desires for our songs it

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.490
doesn't really make any sense right I

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.840
guess I'm what I'm saying is that we

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.980
don't always get all the southern hip

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.600
hop down here so when you hear that

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.380
sparse like you know cliff style

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:21.460
production you go what's going on this

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.460
is new this is fresh

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:29.429
you wanna like a rap you you surprised

00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:30.839
even me sometimes brain so we're going

00:23:29.429 --> 00:23:32.669
to do exactly the same thing we did last

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:35.789
time which is slightly miss boss rush

00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:36.989
and then I mean I actually can't really

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:38.339
say with authority that we're going to

00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:40.469
have a good chance of steamroll the rest

00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:41.299
of this run because it actually like

00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:48.389
sucks

00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:52.139
statistically go experimental good good

00:23:48.389 --> 00:23:53.909
damage upgrade very strongly needed even

00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:56.159
at the cost of a luck downgrade which is

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:58.390
luck downgrade is like no payments till

00:23:56.159 --> 00:24:00.019
2020 you know we don't have to sweat it

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.820
[Music]

00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:03.869
until the chest on the chest if we need

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.279
stuff we're going to be like wish I

00:24:03.869 --> 00:24:08.580
didn't have to have that luck downgrade

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:09.899
but for now you know we get a sofa

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.700
without having to make the payments

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:13.440
there's no downside I mean in 2020 we

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.719
could all be you know annihilated by an

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.669
asteroid or something I will be I will

00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:23.519
die happy knowing that I got the sofa

00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:25.739
without making any payments on it so we

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:27.299
were actually so far away from making

00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:28.889
boss rush we didn't barely miss it

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:31.489
because the mom fight is going to take

00:24:28.889 --> 00:24:31.489
us ten years

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.890
I want to put down some bombs the

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:43.800
problem is you know they get kicked

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:47.760
instead of damage they get kicked the

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:55.410
Zetas devil deals we get tricked with an

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:57.810
experimental treatment the CR is still

00:24:55.410 --> 00:25:00.240
around CR is like the hip-hop artists

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:02.700
from my youth that I always thought like

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.710
to this day if you give me one too many

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.750
adult beverages and then go like hey NL

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:10.050
what do you think about CR is oh and I'm

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:13.110
like that song should a god a number one

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:15.150
it might have gone to number one but it

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.800
should be respected as a modern hip-hop

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.440
classic and nobody's everyone talks

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.850
about one two step I want to talk about

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:29.430
one two step what I'm talking about oh

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:32.400
oh you know what just just freaking get

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:36.320
me dude I don't care I'm going to deal

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:38.730
with the devil because I need damage

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.940
we're getting so much HP out of this but

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.110
I need damage more than anything else so

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.340
I went the old the devil instead of deal

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:48.960
with the angel I compromised my own

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:50.460
principles and I don't know if I maybe I

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.230
should regret that at this point because

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.370
of the situation we find ourselves in I

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:58.650
actually well we were going to take

00:25:53.370 --> 00:26:02.910
damage anyways who cares this is not a

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:04.980
guaranteed win sure we get a demon heart

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.980
and an eternal heart every time we get a

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:11.490
battery charge spacebar RS are natural

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:14.100
or otherwise but I'm not convinced that

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.870
that's going to be enough if we don't

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.160
continue to improve our damage at least

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.920
somewhat like I don't want to do that

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.560
room because our damage is so bad and as

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:26.450
part of the insidious insidiousness of

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.450
having like low damage

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:34.419
means that you're less likely to be

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:36.340
excited about the opportunities that

00:26:34.419 --> 00:26:38.890
might naturally present themselves on a

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:43.510
run oh that was pretty bad I will say we

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:45.640
got one big positive and that's a toxic

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:48.220
shock syndrome gives us a nice little it

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:54.010
basically lowers all I'm not that enemy

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:55.660
came to myself it lowers the should use

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.850
this but at the same time you want to go

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:01.299
like what a waste

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:02.950
um it lowers the maximum HP of these

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:05.740
enemies basically as soon as we walk

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:09.160
into the room come on though this is

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.929
getting a little on the silly side here

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.460
why don't we ever sell we have a 67%

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:16.390
chances we had an Excel floor last time

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:18.790
that's right and we have duality so we

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:20.370
could go angel deal but I think it's

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:29.460
ill-advised

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:31.780
hello Ruka hello Ruka hello Ruka

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:36.250
definitely wants in toil working towards

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:41.650
fun God spawn hello my son

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:47.010
how are you have you just woken up come

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:47.010
on buddy there we go who's a guru Co boy

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.840
you got groomed you get a haircut

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.419
basically so it feels like a like a

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:59.140
brand new couch right now so the first

00:27:55.419 --> 00:28:00.940
time that the petting has been a selfish

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.790
act most of the time I'm like yeah

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.530
you're my pet so I will pet you you know

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:08.200
it's right there in the name now I'm

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:11.590
like you feel good I'm going to pet you

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:14.500
because it's a pleasant sensation it's a

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:16.450
win-win I don't think he's going to meow

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.740
anymore but I can try to solicit a

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.549
conversation it makes me look like a

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:27.270
crazy person

00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:29.650
hey Ruka he's looking at me Ruka Ruka

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:33.580
he's given me a head tilt but he's not

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:35.080
giving me any any conversation he's like

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.210
he didn't pet me enough for me to meow

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.620
don't you know you know I've been part

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:45.880
of this family for like four years you

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:47.230
don't know how this works yet Ruka so i

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.090
played like garbage on this floor but we

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:52.630
got that one a hundo percent devil deal

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:59.700
if i just crank on the cram PO head as

00:28:52.630 --> 00:29:05.830
soon as i go into the next room let's go

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:08.409
okay this is important got a little

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:13.000
lucky there I think that we were able to

00:29:08.409 --> 00:29:15.640
catch a little damage despite the the

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.140
rotation of the laser beam

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.650
we don't have births damage that's the

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:23.710
thing like once once it's used

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:25.900
we no longer nice shot we no longer have

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.730
the tools necessary alike deal a bunch

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:31.809
of damage quickly and we only did like a

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:35.710
half of mom's Hearts HP but we do have

00:29:31.809 --> 00:29:37.330
eight point seven eight damage now so we

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:41.880
actually are able to at least like hit

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:48.790
enemies okay so we want this and we

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:52.840
probably want Judas shadow and it might

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:55.659
seem a little aggressive but I stand by

00:29:52.840 --> 00:30:00.520
it because if we die as long as we can

00:29:55.659 --> 00:30:03.640
live long enough to use our void play we

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.770
should be in a good spot this cat he so

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:09.960
loves the pets sometimes I'll play Isaac

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:12.940
and he'll bite my hand because he's like

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:16.919
you know I you're giving the keyboard

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:19.570
attention but not me Ruka this keyboard

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:23.340
combined with you know my vocal chords

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:28.150
is what makes you cat food money buddy

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:30.750
so you got a you got to lay off daddy's

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.750
working

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:38.320
I am like half thinking we should have

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:44.530
used that on a room of course but I'm

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:46.600
like half thinking that we should become

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.420
dark Judas and half thinking like you

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:52.330
know what just let it happen

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:56.800
enjoy like your bonus HP for now if it

00:30:52.330 --> 00:31:00.570
happens it happens yeah this was like

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:03.340
guaranteed I think if we make it through

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:05.830
Isaac we should be fine you know we've

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:09.280
got that dark Judas respawn and the rule

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:12.100
of the previous runs is coming true like

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.840
we barely miss Basara well we miss boss

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.280
rush by a little bit and then all of a

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.500
sudden the run starts to take off for

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.680
whatever reason but that's what I'm

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.990
complaining of course it hasn't even

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.730
taken off that much it's just like a lot

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:29.590
better than it was I can't believe that

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:32.340
I staved off complaining about 3.77

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:35.770
damage until we were like on the

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:38.650
Necropolis XL 3.77 damage on necropolis

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:41.580
is a bad role unless you got like a rate

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:46.170
of fire that's below the cap we were

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:46.170
still a distance away from the cab

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:57.340
that's fine that's fine I'd like to keep

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:58.990
the eternal heart alive I would have

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:06.730
liked to have kept the eternal heart

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:07.960
alive I would like to live and then you

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:13.120
know two minutes later I would have

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:15.400
liked to have lived I in a way though I

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.740
feel like validated because sometimes I

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.360
complain and then people go I don't know

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.800
what he's complaining about all of my

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.340
complaints come from place of honesty

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:26.230
and a fight like this proves it because

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.600
we're not getting that like baseline

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:30.700
level of issac competency which is

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.680
stopping him from doing two attacks once

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.220
he does the teleport you know he gets to

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:38.940
do two waves of attacks which is not

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.940
acceptable for me

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:48.320
I would much rather take him out before

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:52.760
he gets a chance to do this much damage

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:59.240
she's done now you know what role the

00:32:52.760 --> 00:33:01.550
dice go down Ruka oh I hear the litter

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.590
box outside you just pooped that's why

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.690
you come in here for a pet you don't

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:10.940
need a pet of your poops you don't need

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:12.620
a pet cuz you pooped I am for all of

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.110
these although now that we've taken

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.600
technology explosivo does nothing for us

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:20.480
so we should actually get ready to void

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:24.650
X plus Evo for a stat bonus I am guilty

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:26.360
of not using not using void properly

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:28.040
anymore I don't know what I just had

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.820
like mental atrophy or something with

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.560
with void we can use it to suck up

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:35.710
passives into stat upgrades which is

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.630
something that there's no reason not to

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:41.000
unless you want the passive but you know

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.560
we don't actually get anything out of ex

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.130
post Evo on a stat level so what do we

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:48.200
care we should try to get a I always

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.880
noticed it's way too late because lust

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.190
is the most dangerous of the mini bosses

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:56.390
in here but you should try to get the

00:33:52.190 --> 00:34:00.260
virus out of lust worked out very nicely

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:02.630
for us actually and you know what we

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:06.500
have no bomb suck that up we got shot

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:11.840
speed and luck that's actually fine the

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:13.370
oh I use hangman by accident the shot

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.690
speed upgrade is worth nothing but the

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.700
luck upgrade even though we're still in

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:20.780
the negatives it takes us closer to

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:24.050
being above zero and either way I think

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:27.260
more luck is always a good thing not the

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:29.980
best stat we could have gotten but worth

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.980
something at least

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:38.839
we should really at this point be fairly

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:41.000
safe it's not going to you know make any

00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:43.480
record books for best run of all time or

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.030
anything like that but it is at least an

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:49.399
acceptable and competent sort of

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:51.319
inclusion here in the Isaac Pantheon and

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:55.339
then fun nonetheless as well like we've

00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:59.809
started with some you know back-sass

00:34:55.339 --> 00:35:01.700
word space bar items here and I still if

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:03.650
I'd gotten nine lives I think I would

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.480
have stuck with glass cannon I've come

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.420
to respect glass cannon I think it

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:11.300
requires one specific enabler but the

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.130
enabler shows up very frequently and the

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.500
damage you get out of glass cannon can

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:17.960
be ridiculous so I still don't think

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.690
it's a good for like predominantly take

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:24.710
oblige em but I do think that it's it's

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:27.109
okay if you can get the enabler I think

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:31.369
it can be fun but it is still pretty

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:34.160
rare it's so rare that it's almost raw

00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:36.710
Oh bad Gordon Ramsay where did you come

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.619
from where do you think you Muppet a

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.150
came from England why do you sound

00:35:39.619 --> 00:35:44.569
nothing like Gordon Wren

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:52.400
it's the Kayal you donkey it has ten

00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:54.200
octaves I think there's a there's an

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.770
idea for a Gordon Ramsay character in

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.990
there somewhere

00:35:54.770 --> 00:36:01.089
it's a Gordon Ramsay who always talks

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:03.740
angrily even when he's sincerely happy

00:36:01.089 --> 00:36:08.660
this is the happiest day of my life you

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:10.400
Muppet I love you but that's not it

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.049
doesn't work in reality because Gordon

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.260
Ramsay has this sincere voice all right

00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:18.250
listen I sat down at this is one of

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:20.510
Savile rows top Indian restaurants

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:23.150
owners say receipts have been dragging

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:26.000
I'm here to find out why and then he

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:30.500
goes you can't serve the Bombay chicken

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:36.020
salad with kale it's a spinach salad you

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:37.970
absolute tosser mr. Ramsay I wish you

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:41.520
wouldn't talk to that shut up you donkey

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:45.120
I love you who what

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:48.770

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:53.610
emotions now become Australian again
