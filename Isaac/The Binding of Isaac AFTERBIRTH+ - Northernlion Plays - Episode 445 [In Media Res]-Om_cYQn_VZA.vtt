00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.660
lion pls fighting guys get with Plus we

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.650
lost last run I know even a god can

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.920
bleed supposedly I'm worried what a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.750
strange introduction bottom left is mega

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.120
Satan right so everybody needs mega

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.320
Satan who needs the most Laz needs a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:29.130
[Music]

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:33.170
hush negative mega Satan victory hush

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.910
negative mega Satan we could possibly do

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.760
hush negative and then try to get mega

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.590
Satan to work so GM z j qk and for don't

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.730
take the pill yet i almost a bad habit I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
was like I should take that pill right

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.430
off the bat not true so I'm not gonna

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.510
I'm not gonna force the hush completion

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.850
if it's not plausible

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.170
similarly the best way to get mega Satan

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.250
is to not take deals with the devil and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.710
instead take deals with the Angels so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.470
they're kind of like they're softly at

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.090
odds with one another softly at odds

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.540
with each other

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:16.500
softly it odds with each other slightly

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:21.390
conflicting objectives softly at our

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.840
dream oh this is my life

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.580
okay well but the thing is like the the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.380
reason is that the deals with the devil

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030
tend to give you damage damage lets you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.229
complete rooms faster completing rooms

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.509
faster it gives you a much better chance

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.920
to get into the hush fight on time by

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.570
the way I love playing Lazarus early

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.520
because like the damage we take at the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.710
start of the game usually irrelevant

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.040
save those pills for later like the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.470
English beat and just keep yourself

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.180
moving here oh yeah but you know we can

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.920
definitely here's what I think we should

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.390
do go for the guaranteed finish of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.579
winning a run that goes to the lam fight

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.860
that'll unlock something at the very

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.140
least we've already done delirium with

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.299
Lazarus which is a an annoying one to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.340
knockout because it's not quite as

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.140
random chance like and say there's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.270
something like a 15% chance for that

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.710
portal to show up randomly but along the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.150
same lines as like the different

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.680
of mega Satan just because it's probably

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.230
a little bit easier to guarantee because

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.820
you can you know get the portal 100%

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.350
when you go to the hush fight but like

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.090
substantially harder to make sure that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.540
you actually have the damage and and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.270
other stats necessary to kill delirium

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.780
who is wicked annoying all these big

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.450
rooms dude where do they all come from

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:42.870
ah look at all these stinky big rooms to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.370
do to Tootsie Tootsie Tootsie stone of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.800
the kidney lowering speed with a dubious

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.650
improvement yes no one would guess

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:59.040
thanks for the trolling classic design

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.400
philosophy of Nicolas who could have

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.870
guessed all the trolli items this is way

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.070
too much singing for early on in an

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:14.460
episode either way get highly dusted rag

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:16.140
man I still think kidney stone it's like

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.880
the ultimate betrayal cuz I liked this

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.430
item then when I turned on the HUD I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.190
realized it was a speed down and I don't

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.440
like it at all anymore cuz it's already

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.460
got positives and negatives implicit in

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.140
the item itself why did we have to why

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.690
did we have to go the extra mile you

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.010
know so I think we're gonna try a rule

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.140
that's pretty good though you're gonna

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.650
try a rare Lazarus gamble and for me at

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.700
least it's rare in the gamble is not

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.460
killing ourselves on the first floor

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.690
instead we're going to wait maybe trying

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.980
to kill ourselves on the deal with the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.280
devil we're still like doing fine on

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.070
pace I see a tinted rock up there the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.590
other rub about a these freakin mega

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.120
Satan attempts is that we shouldn't

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.550
stress out about it too too much it's

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.250
still early but the other rub about

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.450
these is that you have to get the deal

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.840
with the devil to get the credit for

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.160
skipping it so we can't just I mean I

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.260
guess you could kind of cheese it a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.560
little bit if you did that but we can't

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.340
just accidentally not get the deal with

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.330
the devil

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.460
and then avoid punishment for basically

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.419
it sets us back one floor no matter what

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.040
if we don't get the deal with the devil

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.139
so we really gotta try not to get hit

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.580
here it might be impossible to get mega

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.520
Satan on this run to begin with because

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.479
not only the first you need to get a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.729
deal with the devil then you got a

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.169
rebuking then you got to say we did

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.520
unlock dad's key recently but that's a

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.919
little bit more low percentage right

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.860
save our bomb for now right we can't get

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.419
to it as quickly as we'd like then

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.760
you've got to have a bomb ready for that

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.990
first angel statue kill the angel statue

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.320
which requires having the stats

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.690
particularly HP then you have to get a

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.310
second angel statue in another deal with

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.419
the angel which despite the fact that

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.729
you just got to deal with the angel

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.320
might never happen so I'm not trying to

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.780
make it sound like it's a hard cooling

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.310
task but it is like rng dependence so we

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.860
want to be want to be as vigilant as

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.229
possible to maximize essentially the the

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.880
number of tickets we got in that in the

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:27.000
mega Satan lottery this room is pretty

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.520
bad but really the fact that we have a

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.300
good rate of fire is gonna carry us a

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.139
long way and I actually think we're

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.590
probably gonna end up being like

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.000
marginally behind schedule at least for

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.070
like having a guarantee to make it to

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.530
the hush fight but all you need is one

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.680
like really good damage upgraded to save

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.030
the day and you said that could happen

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.870
on a boss fight doesn't need to happen

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.870
on a deal with the devil

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.410
so the other reason that it probably

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.830
would have been like there's ripple

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.790
effects on this like Lazarus strat right

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.230
we would have potentially wanted to have

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.670
enacted the Lazarus resurrection on the

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.170
last floor because it would give us a

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.750
luck upgrade the luck upgrade would give

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.340
us a much better chance maybe of getting

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.960
a key on this floor and the key of

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.280
course would give us access to the item

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.990
room who knows what's in the item room

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.930
as of right now we don't have that

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.550
option so there is kind of like a way to

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.860
short-circuit this deal with the Angel

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.200
nonsense by the way if we were able to

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:31.810
get duality but I don't think duality is

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.820
actually unlocked yet either way we're

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.390
doing fine I would almost like to get

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.310
the box as an item here HP is also good

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.440
anything that gives us HP really is fine

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.450
because we want to take enough deals

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.480
with the devil to and around lives that

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.590
does give us bombs at least but this is

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:54.160
an ideal deal

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:59.400
it's an ally mcbeal I know how we do

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.400
this sort of you know I

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:09.590
I got to think about this because two of

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.410
these items give us HP here's what I

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.540
thought we would do take the pact take I

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.070
think the other one is the little

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.980
harbingers and then you would leave the

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.300
room kill yourself with the bombs which

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.440
would require two of them because I

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.870
don't think there's any fires on the

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.970
monstro fight and then respawn in this

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:30.320
room takes in robes however by we don't

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.480
have enough bombs to kill ourselves so

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.010
we would have to pick up matchbook but

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.870
matchbook would give us HP that would

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.540
take us to three we'd use three bombs

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:47.120
kill ourselves respawn in here grab sin

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:55.160
robes I you I didn't know Bono what if

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:59.330
we just not doesn't work either no it's

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:02.090
like what if we grab little harbingers

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.290
walk out pick up the matchbook blow

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.780
ourselves up three times

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.970
take the pact and then take sin ropes

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.770
it's exactly the same right we end up

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:13.370
with three spirit hearts either way I'm

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:16.220
gonna I'm gonna do it that way but it's

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.500
stupid like I don't I don't necessarily

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.630
think this is the right play and also we

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.220
might want to just avoided these to

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:28.340
maximize our deal with the devil chances

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:33.920
but I want the damage bonus and I the

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:36.260
hush and negative are the easy is that

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.090
oh you get for your money so I'm a moron

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.290
I forgot it doesn't resurrect you inside

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.500
of the deal with the devil so

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:49.040
effectively I just more or less screwed

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:52.100
myself that's you know it was dumb I

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.600
forget Li forgot that as Lazarus you you

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.250
see where I was coming from and most of

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.780
the time when you die you respawn in

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.860
another room and you would use that you

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.340
would respawn in the room that you were

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.720
last in just you got a key you'd respawn

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.620
in the room that you were last in which

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.850
would have been the deal with the devil

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.800
which would have allowed us to take all

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.580
the items now am i saying that what I

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.080
did was right

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.330
no what I'm saying is that what I did

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.480
had a the proper methodology as

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.910
characters apart from

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.120
but you know with infinity hours in this

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.590
game with infinity hours in this game I

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.420
shouldn't have done that because that's

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.890
just that's a rookie move or at least

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:31.110
like it's a relatively amateur move

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.190
at being said now we were in a very

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.020
interesting situation because we're

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.000
behind schedule our stats kind of stink

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.670
cuz I just passed up to DPS upgrades

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.020
and our HP sucks our space bar items not

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.010
that good but man we got a heck of a

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:46.320
trinket plus we basically cannot get the

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:48.240
deal with the devil or the sorry we

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.530
can't get the mega Satan fight unless

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.910
you find dad's key so well I've really

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.220
northernlion this went up to begin with

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.420
but you know what it'll just make it

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.130
that much more special when we

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.200
inevitably achieve all of our goals

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.800
regardless of the fact that I royally

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.960
messed it up we're just gonna head down

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.670
to the next floor for now and I'm gonna

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.070
let that be a learning lesson to myself

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:16.650
you always got a mentally double-check

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:21.740
that you're doing the right thing cuz

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.740
that was just what I really munsoned it

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.580
yeah let's open it we really just really

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.620
good actually

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.150
we can't afford to spend too much time

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.350
if we want to make sure we're doing that

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.900
hush fight but I think I've like I've

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.700
passed that dream by I'm gonna rely on

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:39.480
the the strength of the game to carry me

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:42.650
I'm gonna be a dandelion seed friendly

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.650
ball did not do much there

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:54.910
okay five cents that's good I doubt we

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.590
captured it looked like we stole one of

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.090
the nubs out of that leg you know

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.880
Larry's senior but I don't know if

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.790
that's actually the case we'll find out

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.080
on the next room either way it does

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:11.250
contact damage so it's probably gonna

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:11.250
stink pretty badly it's good it's fine

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:18.550
this could pay for itself that would be

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:20.260
X no my donation machine thanks a lot

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:23.290
kidney stone and also my own meager

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.670
intellect okay so we get a mild deal

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.620
with the devil improvement we could get

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.290
some serious friendly ball action going

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:33.970
here yeah okay we did get the head of a

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:35.560
Larry senior stop following me around

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:43.030
and trying to attack me please it makes

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:44.530
me very self-conscious I think I'm not

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:47.380
gonna use friendly ball Dez use it on

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.300
one of these chip brownies yeah because

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:53.890
we already lost another one okay you

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:55.420
guys fight each other please really

00:11:53.890 --> 00:12:00.040
think friendly ball pretty much comes

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:01.420
down to knowing which enemies to focus

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.370
on like if we can get a turret or

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.440
something or one of the flies that

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:11.500
spiders that sticks to a wall we're in a

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.280
good spot please give me a key before oh

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.900
geez

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:20.470
give me a key before our item room

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:23.620
please key lock is zero

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:28.529
we're in potential key town I want that

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:31.229
champion we have captured him

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:33.299
oh that was extremely close to me being

00:12:31.229 --> 00:12:39.389
completely idiotic lock up please lock

00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:40.729
up look up look up no I I still had the

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:43.619
holy mantle thank God

00:12:40.729 --> 00:12:47.969
cuz we kind of need this eternal heart

00:12:43.619 --> 00:12:57.239
to survive the Harbinger the ultimate

00:12:47.969 --> 00:13:02.999
betrayal Ronan the destroyer why should

00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:04.919
I let him blow up the mushroom come come

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:06.839
on okay

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:16.019
this is our moment get out of your

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:17.759
stinky fly I was I was in a mine flooded

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:21.919
world restar we botched that one from

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:25.649
the get-go dude WP z XP mx4

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:27.509
that run was cursed I mean I'm not gonna

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:28.829
say I didn't make any mistakes in fact I

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:35.089
think the whole run was in many ways a

00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:35.089
mistake but cursed run dude cursed run

00:13:35.869 --> 00:13:44.789
camel undies kaskus a far far far far

00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:52.139
far far far far far better stand stand

00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:53.939
stand still stand stand still nowhere no

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:56.659
we're not gonna let's March the good

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:56.659
name of David Byrne

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.150
so what's the game plan here be smarter

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.920
about that first deal with the devil I I

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:11.560
like the commitment to the hush fight

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.560
leave that fly alive hey streamer leave

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.810
that fly alive we want to do that so we

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.790
have a chance to end our own lives get

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.800
the damage multiplier bonus and also the

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:23.230
luck upgrade from becoming dark Lazarus

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.970
or Darth Lazarus if you prefer and then

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:29.230
we can get that eternal heart and be in

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:33.640
a good spot so if you could give me any

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:35.680
HP upgrade like magic scab would be the

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.710
best b+ of all time it would be like a

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.710
b-plus si that could win a scholarship

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:43.650
it comes from a place of great personal

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:46.830
you know reverence or something

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:52.810
irrelevance perhaps relevant reverence

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:55.660
Reverend but to get to one luck and then

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:57.880
have three HP upon leaving this floor

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.230
would be very good plus we could use the

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.640
pill so you might get super lucky and

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.700
have four HP or you know it tears

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.680
upgrade or we'll see anyway he's dusted

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.610
it took us a minute and 41 seconds it's

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:12.550
way better got squeezy it's pretty solid

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:17.620
so I think we'll just leave get this

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:20.820
thing that completely dust us six times

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.820
[Music]

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:31.060
there we go so we respawn take the pill

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:33.190
bombs are keep kind of bad but mostly

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.279
just irrelevant now don't accidentally

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:37.720
walk into that dude again we're gonna

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:39.720
get spirit hearts anyway so you some of

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.160
your newfound bombs to check for maybe

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.959
demon heart or something I'm even gonna

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.589
gonna go one step further probably

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:48.940
should not do this yeah definitely

00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:50.529
should not have done it but I believed

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.110
in the moment and that was my that was

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:53.440
my sin so we're gonna have a good rate

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.589
of fire

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.209
okay damage and pretty solid HP actually

00:15:56.589 --> 00:16:01.240
for the next floor we traded one red

00:15:58.209 --> 00:16:02.800
heart for two spirit hearts which is

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:07.029
maybe an okay deal to begin with and

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.100
then also the the luck and damage

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:10.570
multiplier and permanent and anemia that

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.279
comes along with it so as a productive

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.520
trade and again the earlier you get

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:17.470
going

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.240
the better off you are here it's gonna

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.050
save you a lot of time it's gonna save

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.300
you a lot of damage

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:25.660
you know not all runs are created equal

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.970
a run that gets to you know game-winning

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.079
stats on the second floor substantially

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.079
better than a run that gets a

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:33.100
game-winning stats just before the end

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:34.990
you might be saying if they both come

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.750
out with a win in the end who cares well

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:40.839
true but you know one is easy Street and

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.490
one is you know congratulations so

00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:46.180
you've been promoted to CEO oh you're

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:49.680
dead now the old CEO can't come to the

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.680
phone why not he's dead

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:58.400
all right making great progress actually

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.820
I'm like 20 times more confident in this

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.200
run right now that's not good enough so

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.930
I'm gonna I'm gonna get a little risky

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.260
here that's still not good enough I'll

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:13.430
take it if I have to but uh robo-baby

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:16.700
2.0 is pretty much trashed here it's

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:20.870
like one extremely light step out of

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:22.910
trash so I'm actually gonna do some very

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.440
uh northern lyonie stuff and for example

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.110
shoot these fires to try to get enough

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.320
money to create a reroll and so far so

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.760
good

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:34.790
it's not greed mode we don't have to be

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:36.740
as attached to money necessarily you

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:41.180
pretty much had to guess that we were

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:43.700
coming up on a boss fight here it's how

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:47.720
most floors tend to end my limited

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.130
experience three senses like I'd give

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.830
that a two-thirds chance of getting the

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:53.750
reroll here so I think our stats are

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.330
good enough that if we got DPS we would

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.710
feel comfortable from the boss I mean we

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.240
would feel comfortable not taking a deal

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:07.400
with the devil and trying to create this

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:10.790
deal with the Angels situation I can

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.690
tell but notice definitely not DPS luck

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:15.620
luck luck no luck but rerolls at least

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.810
but we don't have a choices we're still

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.040
gonna be able to possibly create a deal

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.020
with the Angels situation cuz we got a

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.210
spirit heart from our deal with the

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.230
devil which is like I'm not the worst

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.230
possible outcome we could have just

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.100
gotten extra spiders or my favorite

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.240
teleportation to the deal with the devil

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.240
they are already standing in

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.950
now I mean you know what I'm gonna take

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:42.500
it and I don't know if it's gonna work

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.730
very well with anemia but you know what

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.899
I'm looking at here is the idea that

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:49.940
maybe with camo undies we could be like

00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:52.429
the trap layer we could be the stealth

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.679
killer because the enemies don't see us

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:56.450
as long as their enemies that walk on

00:18:54.679 --> 00:19:01.639
the ground we could just lay like a a

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:03.740
sweet trap at their feet preferably if

00:19:01.639 --> 00:19:07.159
we stopped shooting as soon as we

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:13.039
entered the room but we might have like

00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:15.980
a semi potent sort of creep generation

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:18.019
here I don't know I don't know if I've

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.519
ever consciously taken this and and

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:22.159
tried to suss out whether or not it's a

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:24.230
synergy so like don't shoot and just

00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:27.049
walk around these are not the right

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:29.269
enemies to walk around against well

00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:31.730
don't you walk around what I don't you

00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:34.220
Union is a little ass mildly

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:37.779
lesser-known Franz Ferdinand cut it's

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.779
not quite take me out level

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:46.489
but key all right so apparently on the

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.279
flooded caves you exclusively fight

00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:53.019
enemies who fly which is freakin sweet

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:53.019
dude I'm like really excited about that

00:19:54.789 --> 00:20:05.600
stop well I want to spear it hard I want

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.970
a lot of things right now many of them

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.350
related to DPS I don't know I got to put

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.859
this thing out of its misery it's like

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.100
you know

00:20:09.859 --> 00:20:15.350
Ripley 11 from Alien Resurrection gal

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:21.259
May okay deal with the devil please go

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:22.609
devil please sir okay now but notice

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:25.009
that none of that was a deal with the

00:20:22.609 --> 00:20:26.659
devil however we got spirit hearts that

00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:28.009
will protect our dad not deal with the

00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:29.809
devil sorry I deal with the angel rather

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:33.109
but maybe we don't want to deal with the

00:20:29.809 --> 00:20:35.389
Angels we don't have any bombs we also

00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:38.869
need damage or at least some form of DPS

00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:41.090
because if we don't get it this run is

00:20:38.869 --> 00:20:43.909
gonna become pretty impossible to

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:47.080
imagine defeating hush or even like

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:47.080
making it in time I should say

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.919
yeah that'll help and and also not help

00:20:57.019 --> 00:21:01.259
the damage output is gonna be absurd

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.729
unfortunately it's like you know we got

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:05.759
a shotgun we got to be right next to

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:08.219
them to to hit him so what we want is

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:11.999
like this and then arrange neutralizer

00:21:08.219 --> 00:21:13.590
like we can get technology even hesitate

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:16.529
to say it but even tech to or something

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:24.539
might be an adequate option for us in a

00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:26.099
situation like this I'm so like nervous

00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:28.349
about making sure that I don't take

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:30.809
damage it's probably a good practice to

00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:37.379
begin with but like we do have spirit

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:39.299
hearts anything that gets close to us

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:41.279
will not be able to handle the gauntlet

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:43.320
of argue of our administered pain

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:48.389
there's one spirit heart down the drain

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:52.169
for no reason we have two HP so start

00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:53.639
playing this joker right here why wait

00:21:52.169 --> 00:22:01.669
until the end of the room right that's

00:21:53.639 --> 00:22:01.669
just I like to multitask come on

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.460
you can see this I don't know if you can

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.250
feel it but I can feel it I have like a

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.140
sense of there's like how fast you're

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.669
going and Isaac and then there's the

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.409
derivative of how fast you're going and

00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:14.580
Isaac which is how fast is our speed

00:22:13.409 --> 00:22:16.620
increasing you know it's our

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:23.130
acceleration our acceleration right now

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:25.590
is zero more or less so we're really

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.960
hoping and not stall out here in fact

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:33.510
our acceleration might be negative not

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:36.750
to alarm thee excuse me sir we're gonna

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:42.809
go in here because we need a bomb which

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:47.700
does not exist okay what was the point

00:22:42.809 --> 00:22:51.029
of that this basically we need something

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:55.110
we need you to pay out ASAP basically

00:22:51.029 --> 00:23:00.270
the emperor card gets us out of boss

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:01.710
rush if we make it to boss rush you know

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.450
snag a free item we're kind of like

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.549
we're grasping at straws for something

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.169
we can use first victory this has taken

00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:10.260
spirit arts I think at this point but I

00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:11.850
sort of feel like we got to get this

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.710
dude to pay out and we're really

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:20.309
throwing it at the wall here we got no

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:21.779
bomb so I guess it's why we bought the

00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:23.460
three cent spirit artists so it wouldn't

00:23:21.779 --> 00:23:27.210
feel like you know we're throwing away

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:30.570
HP that we already had but that we had

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:32.279
to cling to I should say you know you're

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:35.580
in trouble though when the Forsaken is

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:40.409
like tanky it's possibly the lowest HP

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:42.600
boss we could fight here I know who

00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:47.669
you're thinking not the world's safest

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.289
dodge you know it's no Dodge Ram

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:52.140
four-door that was like a that was a

00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:54.840
Viper sick ok cat-o'-nine-tails is

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.899
wonderful we're about on pace which is

00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:01.919
bad we want to be a lot faster I think

00:23:57.899 --> 00:24:05.630
at least ok please some just a card

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:05.630
could be good and it is but

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.820
I'll give you a little bit of the higher

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.960
font I'll kick it back there we go

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.330
contract from below

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.250
we need that item so like desperately

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.870
because a deal with the devil is

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.410
probably not gonna be what we want

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:22.910
instead we want to deal with the angel

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:25.010
so any deal with the devil items we can

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.500
get like for the low low cost of free

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:31.940
our ideal we want to avoid using the

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:34.120
emperor card let me check this message I

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.860
think it might be slowing us down here

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.670
freakin Skype in this day and age is

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:43.400
like takes 18 gigabytes of visual memory

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:45.320
just to load a freaking the heston

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.110
blumenthal gift that's a real gift on

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.570
skype go to her emoticon rather go test

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.670
it out it's open parenthesis heston

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.710
closed parenthesis he does a little

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.150
chef's kiss sort of thing give it a try

00:24:54.710 --> 00:25:01.190
I get a lot of mileage out of that one

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:03.680
so the Emperor card is still valuable we

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.120
I mean we could use a was actually but I

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.070
think the Emperor is more valuable

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.370
because it's more versatile a was skips

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:13.030
a whole floor of items for us but it

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:15.500
could also get us at a boss rush Emperor

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.090
allows us to get the boss potentially

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.500
deal with the devil item but can also

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:23.020
get us out of boss rush right now I'm

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:25.550
looking at boss rush it's actually fine

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.140
we lost the one red heart as a result

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.670
that's not bad at all you see how many

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.560
red hearts I gave the demon judgement I

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.360
ain't worried about that please don't

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:38.210
shoot again cuz I can't actually offer

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:40.370
anything oh I thought we were gonna be

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.940
good okay now we got two bombs no keys

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.940
with two bombs

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:53.100
I on this what a strange way to express

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.640
that what a strange way to expression

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.990
I smell the puzzle on this one though

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.640
you know I got it I got a sniff of the

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:04.350
puzzle that's a better way to describe

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:06.300
it and we got the pieces in the proper

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.710
we got all the corners look I've never

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.300
been really good at puzzles okay I'm a

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:15.840
crossword guy I guess it is called a

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:19.400
crossword puzzle never been much of a a

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.960
a visual learner to be honest with you

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.370
there we go double keys that's contract

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.530
from below coming through in the clutch

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.900
that I step on so now I'm just blinking

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.520
because of our weird synergies virus is

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.470
very good especially if we can get our

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.950
luck stat higher I do hate that it

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:36.750
lowers our speed but you know that's in

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:38.370
2017 Isaac that's just what happens

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.830
every good item lowers your speed

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:44.370
because apparently that's the design

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:46.440
philosophy that all the balance changes

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.670
went through that's not necessarily fair

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.440
they might have lowered your speed for a

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.540
long time and I'd only recently noticed

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:56.400
because of the HUD but still irritates

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:59.810
me a little bit cuz speed is just like a

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.790
it's like clean drinking water you know

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:04.800
it's it's not like if you have clean

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.090
drinking water you're set but if you

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.800
don't have clean drinking water

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:12.810
you're screwed your runs not getting

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.550
overpowered because of speed but it can

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.400
completely ruin your run to just get

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.460
like hit with negative speed or very

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.150
little speed at all times

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.680
dangerously close to falling behind

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:26.040
paceful we're falling behind pace for

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:30.030
boss rush that's actually non critical

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.830
for us you know we could miss boss rush

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.780
and make hush happens all the time

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.860
probably

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.930
don't want the red hard yet because

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:41.290
we're is it's non-essential like we're

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:43.270
still I mean little chats not a great

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.290
pickup admittedly but we don't need we

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.730
don't need the red hard it's actually

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.260
gonna stop us from getting into things

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:49.150
like that boss Trap room which I'm

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:56.670
tempted to do except our key stat is

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:59.680
still pretty garbage okay angel let's go

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:07.750
we will grab little Chad we will

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:10.260
absolutely grab a holy mantle so

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:13.140
defensively much better position now

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:15.220
offensively it pretty good

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.870
the biggest problem with our offense

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.230
right now is our range but even that is

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:21.730
not too too bad right now we can't get

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.730
two key pieces here I think we can only

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:26.080
get the ones so just run from that now

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.210
we've got a better chance of getting

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.670
deals with the angel in the future very

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.440
nice now I will say if we get both key

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.000
pieces screw the hush fight we can make

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.700
the hush fight happen on any old you

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.180
know brimstone mom's knife run mega

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:42.550
Satan is a much bigger threat in terms

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:45.790
of like existentially making me want to

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:47.380
stop playing the game because will take

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:51.480
a hundred years to try to just find the

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.480
proper conditions to make it happen so

00:28:52.320 --> 00:29:00.430
we absolutely want to commit to that if

00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:02.020
possible No thank you sir yeah well it

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:06.040
will check this as well again not

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:07.690
necessarily swimming in time but oh we

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.550
should be using holy okay iciar iciar

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:12.850
play we should be using holy mantle

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.650
basically on every room to inflict

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.880
enemies with the virus and get demon

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.190
hearts out of it if we get the demon

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.840
hearts we can use the demon arts to

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.820
clear rooms faster and generate more

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.020
demon hearts in the process I'm not sure

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:28.300
how that's gonna work with a pretty

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:30.570
god-awful luck stat but should at least

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.570
try

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.860
double Keys still got enough bombs if

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:41.809
we're able to get a deal with the angel

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:43.399
on this floor so that's pretty much what

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:44.570
you're hoping for is that exact

00:29:43.399 --> 00:29:46.639
situation right there

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:52.039
you walk into two enemies they both give

00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:53.299
you a demon heart now it does mean that

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:57.019
essentially we're kind of playing

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:58.370
without having holy mantle just you know

00:29:57.019 --> 00:30:00.350
immediately throwing it away on every

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:05.360
room but I think it's like highly worth

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:08.120
it okay 15 minutes so boss rush I would

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.850
say just kiss it goodbye not like a you

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.240
know particularly passionate kiss just

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:16.370
like a see you later see you next run

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:23.179
your existence is non-essential for us

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:25.850
at the present moment so that was

00:30:23.179 --> 00:30:27.889
actually very useful for us it proved to

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:30.350
us that we can inflict an enemy with the

00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:31.730
virus not kill it while it's poison and

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.950
still give the demon heart out of it

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:38.389
which is a nuance of this kind of

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:39.740
synergy I often times forget we

00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:46.669
essentially have an extremely

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:50.679
overpowered combo right now we even have

00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:53.149
like a 20% chance to get a demon hard

00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:56.120
I'm not gonna crunch the numbers but you

00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:59.029
know you can imagine a graph of how our

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:02.450
power can grow in your head maybe I

00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:04.779
don't know now if we can get like blind

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:07.370
rage this blind rage make holy mantle

00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:09.710
the the invincibility from holy mantle

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:12.529
lats let me rephrase the way I'm trying

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.970
to explain this with blind rage whenever

00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:15.919
you get hit you get a longer cool down

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.629
before you can get hit again does this

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:19.070
work with holy mantle so if we get hit

00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:22.039
we'd have even longer to inflict more

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:23.000
enemies with our afflict more enemies I

00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:26.889
should say with our poison because

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.889
they're so it's like pretty solid dude

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:34.690
like getting three enemies per room is

00:31:32.129 --> 00:31:36.940
excellent the other thing is if we

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.559
already have lost holy mantle and we'd

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.849
run into an enemy regardless it's gonna

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:41.849
kill all the other enemies in the room

00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:50.649
yeah like like that but I shouldn't have

00:31:48.219 --> 00:31:53.950
done that that was just that was an

00:31:50.649 --> 00:31:55.389
exercise in what not to do so we've got

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.070
like an accountants run right now you

00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:58.929
know this is the run we're like we've

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.999
inherited a lot of wealth and we're just

00:31:58.929 --> 00:32:03.399
letting it sit in an index fund

00:32:00.999 --> 00:32:05.669
generating 10% a year annually well I

00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:08.320
mean let's be honest like five okay

00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:10.450
pretty good rates not particularly

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:15.729
exciting but you know the numbers work

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:18.159
out what we would like to do is get you

00:32:15.729 --> 00:32:19.869
know have that money generating money

00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:21.729
for us but then also found like the

00:32:19.869 --> 00:32:23.830
world's greatest milkshake start-up or

00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:25.719
something that way we can have the

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:29.200
exciting world of competitive milkshake

00:32:25.719 --> 00:32:32.200
marketing and also the the the security

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.690
and comfort blanket of a passive

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.339
investment strategy which I know is why

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.499
you watching these videos in the first

00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:45.690
place

00:32:37.499 --> 00:32:47.979
SiC we do want those bombs excuse me sir

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.539
we do want those bombs cuz we got

00:32:47.979 --> 00:32:50.919
scatter bombs now and scatter bombs holy

00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:53.999
mantle could be awesome that was just

00:32:50.919 --> 00:32:58.409
horrible by the way please

00:32:53.999 --> 00:33:05.589
sixty two point five percent chance of a

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:08.830
deal with the angel very valuable right

00:33:05.589 --> 00:33:12.489
now we've done it so this I mean the

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:15.009
shot speed upgrade probably garbage the

00:33:12.489 --> 00:33:18.909
card card against humanity it's just

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:20.979
money you can't take it with you Dead

00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:24.489
Sea Scrolls also I mean pretty terrible

00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:26.229
but we don't have anything else so we

00:33:24.489 --> 00:33:30.749
can actually use our bombs offensively

00:33:26.229 --> 00:33:30.749
like hey bombs you stink

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.150
the most offensive insult I can think of

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:52.649
I have to be honest like are our dps

00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:56.730
output still pretty much horrible it was

00:33:52.649 --> 00:33:57.899
just dusted you generate enough spirit

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.600
arts and explore to not don't worry

00:33:57.899 --> 00:34:03.470
about any of this garbage second key

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:07.679
piece dropped a demon heart

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:09.720
grab that down to the next floor okay so

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:13.050
the emperor card I think we now approach

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:17.669
that as if it's like a it's a Sheol play

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:19.260
although we could use it here that's

00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:20.359
horrible okay so there goes our emperor

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:25.409
card

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:28.649
it's a Sheol play ran a pram been around

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:30.540
it's a getting it's a Sheol play sing it

00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:32.070
with me if you know it right okay now

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.510
now we can take deals with the devil by

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:36.570
the way so like this would be a great

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:39.990
floor can I ask you something why do we

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.980
have a 105 chance of 105 percent chance

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:47.520
of getting a deal with the devil right

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:52.679
now is my math checking out there is it

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:55.020
a Sheol so little baggie is actually

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:58.920
horrendous not only do we lose our

00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:05.310
ability to not only do we lose our

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:06.390
ability to do a emperor card usage like

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.190
we're definitely not gonna make boss

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.930
rush i think hush is now in question but

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:14.150
to be honest with you i want to fight

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.150
hush with this stat line right now

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:27.930
I want to fight hush with with some more

00:35:22.289 --> 00:35:32.130
power perhaps like unlimited power as

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:34.190
sheev Palpatine said I'm such a nerd I

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:40.680
know he knows things about Star Wars the

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:44.190
80 billion dollar franchise please

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:46.680
please thank you excuse me sir

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.670
I have received an important message one

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.420
moment please this is highly

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:57.359
unprofessional but I must check it

00:35:51.420 --> 00:36:01.920
regardless disregard not highly

00:35:57.359 --> 00:36:03.450
important at all and I don't know how

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.720
many times I got on this tangent if I

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:09.510
get a text message there's two things

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.299
that you'd say there's three things love

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:16.230
you can you pick up X from the grocery

00:36:12.299 --> 00:36:17.579
store or oh my god there's been a

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.260
terrible accident I'm not saying I want

00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:20.970
texts that say there's been a terrible

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.910
accident just saying you know it's

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:27.720
important it's got to be it's got to be

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:29.630
information that's passed on if I get a

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.069
telephone call and I'm not arrested

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:35.730
that's like I will not accept your

00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:37.529
telephone call what I will do is wait

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.750
until the call goes to voicemail and

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:42.779
then I'll Google the number and see you

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:45.480
know what other paranoid 80 year olds

00:36:42.779 --> 00:36:47.339
like myself have said it it makes me sad

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.980
sometimes cause like I get these calls

00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:52.140
and then I google the number and they're

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:54.720
like it's a scam they tried to tell me

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.990
that you know my car was impounded but

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:00.119
I'm like dude your car was impounded I

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:03.420
blocked enough while they were three so

00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:06.240
we have there's a service in British

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.069
Columbia let me put it this way despite

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.539
the fact that we you know in Canada are

00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:11.730
renowned for having quote unquote free

00:37:09.539 --> 00:37:14.670
health care in British Columbia there's

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:16.049
a service where essentially you have if

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.609
you your income is over a certain

00:37:16.049 --> 00:37:20.099
threshold you have to pay into their

00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:21.329
insurance system in order to continue to

00:37:20.099 --> 00:37:23.160
get free health care it's not a lot of

00:37:21.329 --> 00:37:25.559
money the pales in comparison to like

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.700
the premiums for health insurance outs

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:27.960
where in the world but still you're

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.190
gonna say that's BS

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.760
sure maybe it is maybe it isn't that

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:34.440
doesn't matter um I got a call from them

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.450
but I didn't answer it I googled it and

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.430
I saw a comment from somebody that said

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:40.500
like it was people asking me to pay my

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:42.570
health insurance why won't you just let

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.890
me die in peace and I was like that's a

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:49.260
saddest story ever told there I mean to

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.580
be fair I mean I guess since if you got

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.500
a health problem and you got people

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.560
calling you going like hey make sure you

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.940
give us your 70 bucks this month so you

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.550
can keep having health insurance and

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.190
you're you know in a bad state I could

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.780
see that that would be a problem but the

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:07.050
fact that they left that comment

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.910
publicly was just like funny in a dark

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:11.130
way of course but also just like

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.839
horrendously depressing the jar not

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:15.599
worth it

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:22.609
placebo potentially absolutely worth it

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:25.440
Wow we got to donate one cent pretty bad

00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:29.880
like placebo pheromones is okay

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.890
placebo helped down is good actually if

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.880
we get deals with the devil

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:38.190
otherwise it's worthless but that's

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.300
still okay how great question you know

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:42.900
we should blow these up because they

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:45.390
could give us pills if they give us

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.880
pills we can use them look with placebo

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:50.130
to maybe get something amazing like what

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:55.140
kind of pill would we want cheese I

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:57.869
don't know range upgrades have to

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.950
imagine if they existed we probably had

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:06.089
a good chance to have seen them already

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:10.070
but still bad trip it's not that bad

00:39:06.089 --> 00:39:10.070
to find out that it exists not that bad

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:18.410
so if there's a merciful God on planet

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:20.480
earth they will give me a spirit heart

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:23.150
as that a spirit heart sorry they will

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:25.250
give me a damage upgrade via a deal with

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:29.060
the devil here again the hush fight is

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:39.050
gone like Tuesday in that song by Led

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:40.640
Zeppelin mega Satan still exists but

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:42.619
even with full HP that mega satan fight

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:50.180
is gonna be a slog with this level of

00:39:42.619 --> 00:39:56.570
damage you can't even really benefit

00:39:50.180 --> 00:40:07.369
from the tears upgrade deal with the

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:10.070
angel let's take the negative seven

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:12.530
seals it's an angel and a devil item I

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:15.260
did not know that so I stuck with the

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:19.670
tears upgrade as placebo or with placebo

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:25.910
I should say because I think it's it's

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:28.250
just the right call isn't it we're

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:32.660
probably at the tear cap already but if

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:34.730
we're not well loved having the ability

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.500
to get some extra charges or some extra

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.849
rate of fire increases like I don't know

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.619
if the number one just takes you to the

00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:41.530
tear cap or if it improves your tears by

00:40:39.619 --> 00:40:43.940
X or if it lowers your to your cap and

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.730
improves your tears by X where you know

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:48.260
X is a value that I'm not familiar with

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:52.130
kind of flying by the seat of my pants

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:54.070
as always we got a try though it's not

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.150
like health downs doing anything for us

00:40:54.070 --> 00:41:00.890
yeah so at present it doesn't do

00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:02.060
anything it might might later again we

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.700
have a one hundred and five percent

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.570
chance of a deal with the devil or deal

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.570
with anything

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:13.960
but our dps leaves like a lot to be

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.960
desired

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:21.590
another tears up so useless at present

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:26.480
help them so that's a pill we probably

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:29.330
should have placebo instead extra devil

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.310
chance please yeah yeah okay I'll take

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:35.300
that I don't know how to think about

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:36.890
this though cuz we have a 40% chance of

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:41.570
a deal with the devil and a 70% chance

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:43.310
of a deal with the angel so I'm pretty

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.380
sure we have a one-third chance of a

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:50.960
deal with the devil still we have like a

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:52.369
40 out of 120 percent roughly but it's

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.820
not the way we tend to think about

00:41:52.369 --> 00:41:58.070
percentages on planet Earth so I'm

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.600
actually not sure this can't dude so

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.830
you're gonna be like that feed your cat

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:05.000
the cat is fed might be a little

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.290
attention hungry right now but I can't

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.080
let him in because you just whenever I

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:12.109
let him any jumps on the computer

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:14.090
Roka you know I'm gonna let him in as

00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:15.770
well as the other thing to thine own

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.090
self be true as soon as we finish this

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.859
room I'm gonna open the door and go hey

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.480
buddy he's gonna jump on the computer

00:42:18.859 --> 00:42:29.450
and I'm gonna go no you can't do that

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:31.869
that's a bad cat would you like to get

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.869
in your box

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:38.040
he's like oh hell yeah but he doesn't

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.600
want to get in the box he wants to he's

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.170
gonna bite me on the hands

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:47.640
bombs are key not relevant tears up

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:51.570
still not relevant please more bombs I

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:55.920
could use them health up is worth

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:57.900
holding do we need a health up and a

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.870
health down no probably not and health

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.820
up is much more versatile

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:05.490
or at least much more universally good

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.380
oh my god cat what are you doing you

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:10.740
know what it is so like I was sick three

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:13.350
weeks ago because I'm a slob I still had

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:16.140
like the little plastic wrapper that

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:17.610
goes around the cap of nyquil you know

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:20.850
the little you tear it off and then you

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:23.880
can open the cap you waited until I was

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:25.890
in the shower then he tried to take that

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:29.340
but I heard it I cuz I left the door

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:30.630
open I heard I was like what's this guy

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.040
doing I hop out of the shower he's

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:33.690
trying to eat the plastic wrap and now

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.200
he's going where's the plastic wrap I

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:38.280
threw it out you dummy you do it to

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.280
yourself

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:44.550
you do and that's what really hurts you

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.400
do it to you see I mean he doesn't think

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:57.000
this guy doesn't listen to Radiohead

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:58.860
he's a Kassabian fan cat Sabian it's

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.960
like the worst best dodge I've ever done

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.870
so again what's what's our game plan if

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:08.520
we can fight hush will I at this point

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:10.160
honestly no and stop asking me why won't

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:15.030
you let me just die in peace

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:16.400
you know what health up bad trip yeah

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:19.590
yeah yeah

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:22.620
then we stack up as many health upgrades

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:25.190
as we can and every four rooms we can

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.190
get the full HP

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:31.840
we're in a very very good spot

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:38.980
I would reroll my whole run it doesn't

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:41.110
reroll the key pieces I think so stop

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.660
I like the luck upgrade it's a little

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:46.180
too little too late but we don't have

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:48.190
mega satan done on this night okay that

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:51.040
was gonna be a little cheese i don't

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:53.380
have to be a little cheese dude I gotta

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.120
be honest with you is that the grocery

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:57.910
store you gotta roll with it

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:01.660
I was at the grocery store yesterday I

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:03.310
bought string cheese I know what you're

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:07.630
thinking string cheese is a food for

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:09.100
children why it's just cheese I'm not

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:10.240
eating string cheese because it's fun

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.640
I'm eating the string cheese because

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.690
it's convenient I haven't eaten any of

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:19.690
them yet I had real talk when I lived in

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:20.950
Korea occasionally I would get string

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:22.600
cheese as like a snack from the

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:26.830
convenience store because I was very for

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:28.810
it but I I'm bringing back string cheese

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:30.430
I think it already is like somewhat back

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:32.200
I know Barre tab he talks about string

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:34.840
cheese from time to time relatively

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:40.330
healthy conveniently packaged snack that

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:43.660
is on fairly relegated to children

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:45.070
because it seems like a toy food but

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.770
I'll buy some good cheese's

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:51.100
I got nothing wrong with that you know

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:55.240
I'll buy some oka I'll buy some smoked

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:57.310
gouda I understand that many of you out

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.900
there but this North American thinks he

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.640
knows about fromage know you know okay

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:04.090
I'll admit North America hasn't always

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.130
had the greatest cheese culture unlike

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.420
North American beer culture where when

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.920
people write it off I think they're just

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:14.070
completely ignoring the fact that the

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:14.070
micro brewery scene exists

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:21.220
you're probably right the North American

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:22.600
cheese market probably not quite as wait

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:24.900
a minute how do we not get a deal with

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.820
devil on the last footage I just miss it

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.860
the North American cheese market

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.130
probably a little bit dampened compared

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:36.360
to the European market I mean you do

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:39.250
encounter people here from time to time

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.330
we can get like unlimited HP so I say

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.040
that sort of thing we should just go for

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:44.290
like this and make sure you go down

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.030
where it's bleep yeah make sure you go

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.950
downwards not that it matters because we

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:49.330
can't get both accomplished but in order

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.300
to find mega saving we have to go down

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:55.300
you do get people who are like

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:57.340
mozzarella that's I said it wrong but

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:59.110
it's better that way mozzarella no

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.820
thanks I don't like ethnic food you know

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:03.760
like that does happen from time to time

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.440
I'm not gonna deny it not commonly he

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.610
also good people here then you know in a

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.250
certain tax bracket

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.960
have you had the gorgonzola from the oka

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:14.530
region of French Canada this year it's

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.310
quite wonderful you get all kinds what

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:20.080
I'm trying to say

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:22.990
rokka rokka what's your favorite kind of

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.300
cheese buddy can't have any really did

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:27.460
you know cats aren't supposed to drink

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.770
milk it sounds like I have a story about

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:31.510
that but no is it I was told by cartoons

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:35.760
that cats love milk that may well be

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:38.350
true but they're not supposed to have it

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:42.610
I've never fed the cat's milk just cuz

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:48.490
like just kind of no no impetus I don't

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:49.960
buy milk myself to begin with not

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.480
because of like a particular situation

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:55.930
at the berry guild I'm just saying we

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:58.750
represent but their email guild but

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:01.690
every email Gil I am gonna take that cat

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:04.630
so I first off your boys are moron and

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:08.590
you should know this already why would I

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:10.270
ever take all those health ups before

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:12.210
taking nine lives the real answer is

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:15.760
that were 48 minutes into this video

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:17.890
your boy's brain is exhausted okay so

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.480
we're all we have the right strategy or

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.330
to it we've got a couple of intersecting

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.940
levels of idiocy hey cat I love you

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.850
you're my best friend can you not be

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.370
next to my

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:34.580
during hockey because I don't want to

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:37.010
compromise our congenial relationship so

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:39.740
wait first off what's like the biggest

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.850
stupid thing I've been doing well taking

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:45.020
all those health upgrade pills at the

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:51.590
wrong time but for real we should use

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:52.880
our our Guppies head right when the

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:55.730
rooms about to finish so we can enjoy

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:57.170
the stat bonus for longer and I got rid

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.790
of placebo because we already you know

00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:04.990
I've gotten so many HP upgrades out of

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:04.990
it even if I did ruin almost all of them

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:13.010
ok that was strange CAD you done you

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:15.520
pushed my microphone away no no you

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:17.720
can't do that

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:26.150
hey kitty

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:28.840
leave that tech alone be cool be cool be

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.840
cool drop it

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:34.520
I think there was an explosion from a

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.619
fly explosion from a fly my favorite

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.140
post rock band as well and it knocked

00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:40.910
all of the bombs away the cat just moved

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.930
the microphone but I can't nothing I

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:45.319
could do about it at the present moment

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:51.020
excuse me sir stop doing that please I'm

00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:51.890
a professional I'd say this is a thing

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.200
he comes in here

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:55.730
I understand can't psychology he's not

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.240
coming in here thinking I'm gonna bite

00:49:55.730 --> 00:50:00.920
this dude's hands but he spends a little

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.520
time in here and he goes why isn't he

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.829
petting me

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:09.560
and he bites my hands it just is like a

00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:12.470
compulsion he can't resist my spirit

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.550
hearts I guess so 10 out of 10 apart

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:16.760
from that we're basically just good

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:19.339
you're gonna say no NL you gotta you

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.780
gotta go fight the negative ugh first no

00:50:19.339 --> 00:50:22.730
we already tried that like two runs ago

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.839
can't be done you can't you can't knock

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:25.369
out both in one run

00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:29.240
maybe you can't if you victory lap

00:50:25.369 --> 00:50:34.670
actually but your dude is not gonna do

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:36.230
that because you know it's gonna be an

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.000
85 minute long video and we're gonna

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.359
have to victory lap anyway again at some

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.310
point

00:50:38.359 --> 00:50:41.810
you got to do three victory laps or

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:44.000
something I'd rather save the victory

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:45.680
lap for like a run that's actually

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.220
powerful instead of this run which is

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.990
just like good enough

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:52.880
Ruka and you can't possibly understand

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:54.950
what I'm about to say to you but you

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.930
don't have to pet yourself using my hand

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.819
if you literally give me like two

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:01.250
minutes I'll give you the pet of a

00:50:58.819 --> 00:51:04.160
lifetime buddy and you won't want it buy

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:06.440
them which is the there's something you

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:11.210
know sad but also poetic about that

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:14.450
you'll be like nah just let me sleep he

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:19.280
does I'll do right pets and exactly the

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:20.660
wrong times so I'm not using Guppies

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.319
head because I feel like the stat bonus

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.670
is probably more valuable right now we

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:28.609
really lucked out with the guppy

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:31.670
transformation we're it not for the

00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:33.530
guppy transformation will harbinger come

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:36.140
on dude we're an odd for the guppy

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:37.640
transformation our DPS would be pretty

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:41.500
bad and I'm not sure number one would be

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.500
like fully justified existing but

00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:47.670
instead it's actually like what's pretty

00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:49.440
great me still a bad trip in case we

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.190
take too much damage but this it's not

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.539
gonna happen

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:58.170
in fact I'm probably just gonna tank

00:51:51.539 --> 00:52:01.109
these remaining shots you are stepping

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:03.480
actually directly onto my testicles all

00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:05.640
I see you jumping on that computer my

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.460
friend I see you getting ready to jump

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:13.349
on that computer you go you escape this

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:15.210
room problem solved long baby

00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:16.319
what an incredible unlock either way

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.460
