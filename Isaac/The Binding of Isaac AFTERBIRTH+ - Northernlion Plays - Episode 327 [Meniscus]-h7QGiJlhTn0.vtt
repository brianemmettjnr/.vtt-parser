00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.210
let's go welcome back northern land

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
plays of binding of issac doing eatin

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.590
runs and honestly the eatin gods have

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.290
been good if I've learned something in

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.360
my long pseudo illustrious I had a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.060
career you make hay when the Sun's up

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.539
buddy because when you hit dusk

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.250
ya ain't got the lucky you used to why

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.590
pH c3 mm eh I don't like that it has THC

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.330
in it I don't like that it as MMA in it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.880
one number we know numbers bring the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.850
strength so I'm a little scared here why

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.129
not THC I'm anti drug the only drug I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.930
take is the drug of life also caffeine

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.170
technically sugar I guess we want to get

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.260
to that level croc a deal sometimes no

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.700
this is joke why not MMA the only

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.170
violence I have is in video games

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.239
otherwise I'm a pacifist

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.100
little baby 0.97 good rate of fire 0.97

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.440
speed rate of fire is 9 which is good

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.579
sure the extrapolator that separated

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.239
them and set it that way damage is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.790
terrible shielded tears is a decent

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
because our rate of fire is fine better

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.360
than fine and the straw is a lovely

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.770
starting item so I actually think that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.210
we're probably looking at like a six six

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.720
and a half out of ten start here

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.310
good rate of fire below average damage

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.900
very good spacebar item especially if

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.040
things continue to pop and shielded

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.140
tears is not useless

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.580
it will have an impact on the run one

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.650
way or the other hopefully that impact

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.119
is in the positive direction but I will

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.659
say you never know you know

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.670
I will not replace the straw with

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.110
shootable

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:41.189
the straw the straw at night is big and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.840
bright deep in the heart of Eden know

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.930
why the straw is what does so much

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.490
damage here but strange choice for this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.090
item I mean I've had some sharp straws

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.979
in my day

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.799
use it to pierce the veil oh let's go

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.140
now you use it to pierce the frosting on

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.670
your bubble tea cup so I don't really

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.329
like bubble tea that much but I've seen

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.250
it consumed I've eaten it in my life or

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.899
I mean it isn't something you drink or

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.520
something you eat I've got a little bit

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.160
of both right because of the tapioca

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.930
pearls but not really that much of a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.920
bubble tea man I'm not going to say that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.670
bubble tea is nest

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.200
Sara Lee a feminine food because I think

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.110
that that's like some needless pink is a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.060
girl's color blue is a boys color sort

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.790
of weirdness what I will say is that I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.060
have never met a dude in my life who is

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.350
as excited about bubble tea as every

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.140
girl I've ever met in my life who's

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.190
excited about bubble tea like my wife is

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.050
a bubble tea monster and I use that word

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.970
in like the Monsters Inc sort of cute

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.459
sort of way instead of like the babadook

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
sort away although the babadook s-- in

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.950
the news for different reasons now so

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.590
you can't win for losing on this one but

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.150
she is like sometimes I have to talk her

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.060
about talk her out of getting like

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.739
bubble tea delivered like you know we

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.150
are looking for something to get ordered

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.920
in on Friday night you know a nice

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.540
little night watch a movie or something

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.400
like that on the digital cable box

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.040
because we're a hundred years old

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.260
and then she's like oh we can get like

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.970
that place and then also they've got

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.400
bubble tea on this place I'm like I'm

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.260
not kind of wait for a bubble tea order

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.590
and a food order from another place

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.209
that's absurd but I respect that you

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.530
know what in this life you know what you

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.440
like and you go for it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.720
and for her that's that's bubble tea I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.400
mean also you know me I hope at least if

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.630
it came down to me versus bubble tea I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.070
hope she did it first be like why are

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.989
you drawing this arbitrary distinction

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.920
and I'd be like well I just want to know

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.769
you know if it should be an easy answer

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.720
and then she'd be like fine you but

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.390
bubble tea would never ask that just so

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.220
you know and that's something in the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.549
bubble tea camp I can't deny that but

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.750
I'm a petty man being outfoxed by a

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.030
class of drink here first floor it's

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.900
done it was about I mean in terms of

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.140
like pace pretty normal we do like old

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.660
bandage I don't know why I said it so

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.750
strangely but I do like old bandage and

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.500
we should have a cause to celebrate

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.760
having more HP containers because I mean

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.440
old bandage is going to help fill them

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.210
up the straw is going to help fill them

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.730
up but obviously like DPS is on our mind

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.310
right now

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.330
and mysterious multi-dimensional baby

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.530
not doing a fantastic job of making that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.590
alleviating that concern let's say but

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.420
this run is like we've had way way worse

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.880
if we get a speed upgrade and a ended

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.980
DPS upgrade preferably damaged but tears

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.030
with shielded tears would also be fine

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.930
then I will be I'll be loved in life is

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.000
there anything we can get to have a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.300
charge up or increase the speed at which

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.420
we charge up the the straw I'm trying to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.480
think don't know if anything that

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.080
charges within the course of a single

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.730
room that has enemies on it can can

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.260
actually get a charge boost but it's not

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.540
that it matters that much dude please

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.280
thank you all right all right all right

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.280
so we definitely want to use a bomb here

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.790
get the Emperor you know what I'm

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.070
actually going to pop that Emperor card

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.230
right away

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.520
reasoning for that basically comes down

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.630
to I want this deal with the devil as

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.910
soon as possible I don't think we're

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.290
going to squander it but I want VPS if

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.510
you're going to give me DPS and the more

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.500
the merrier as far as straw charges here

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:43.460
straw charges then I wish you saw little

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.750
horn in a devil now this you know what

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.180
let's go angel deals we haven't had a

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.920
full on angel deal run in in a little

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.100
while here and I'd like to see the angel

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:02.570
deals pop some trinkets that make angel

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:05.030
deals better that's pretty good and we

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.800
haven't we haven't had too many

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.570
situations I mean might never

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.460
proportional to the number of runs that

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.470
we do get too many situations where

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.870
we're like the new angel deals have done

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.710
it again you know but we haven't had too

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.360
many runs where the angel deals seem to

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.640
give us everything we wanted in more in

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.280
this life so hopeful that maybe we can

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.440
make that happen piggy bank is fine

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.120
that's why I picked it up I don't expect

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.230
it to be great but we do have enough HP

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.260
and and the means with which to play a

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.060
lot of blood banks if we're we're able

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.360
to get there we got a lot of HP coming

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.389
from

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.810
bandaged hopefully coming from the straw

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.659
coming straight out of Compton crazy

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:54.889
maple fudger named ice cube from the

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:59.180

version the pg-13 version is just it's

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:13.759

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:13.009
key if Ellen know the speeds downgrade

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:14.270
is is very nasty I'm willing to push the

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.379
limit on this one it's basically what

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.939
I'm getting that's what we're looking

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:17.449
for old Vantage comes through in the

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:19.909
clutch

thanks for the red heart nothing

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:23.110
personnel kid

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:30.450
just throw in spirit hearts away but

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.680
I've got a dream that we're gonna pull

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.660
this one together I'll go down to two

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.760
spirit hearts and it might seem

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:40.770
ridiculous it may actually be ridiculous

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:43.710
but I want the I want the blood bag very

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.360
much and if we can get some luck

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.070
upgrades or just a ton of money out of

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.800
it either way that's also fine by me but

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.120
I really want the blood bag for the sort

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.710
of speed upgrades I don't want to deal

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.200
with 0.85 speed I didn't want to deal

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.580
with 0.97 speed and now that's even

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.040
worse I certainly don't want to mess

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.930
about with thank you thank you okay we

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.990
got a trinket I'm not worried about boss

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.540
rush on this run if it happens it

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.620
happens probably will not at this point

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.800
and that's fine

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.660
so we got blood bag sure we sacked a lot

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.790
to make it happen I'm okay with that we

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.800
also have 55 cents now which is very

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.210
good

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.790
so we're two minutes behind schedule but

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:25.050
I don't think we're going to make up two

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.370
minutes with our with our run just

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.510
because of the extra speed that we got

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.190
especially considering there is a speed

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:32.190
downgrade associated with it as well but

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.980
I do think that if I can go back in time

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.270
and do that again I totally would so

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.920
again we're going deals with the Angels

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.430
so we should save a bomb if possible but

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.430
I think we've been that floor actually

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.600
makes me feel pretty good because it you

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.740
know that's how you know I don't want to

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.880
say that you're a master of your craft

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.990
but that's how you know you're

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.460
comfortable with the game when you're

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:55.500
like you know what I could throw away a

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:58.260
lot of a very precious resource right

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.450
here to gain something that's a little

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.930
bit more of a luxury for myself and

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.880
probably be completely fine and it's

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.180
pretty much like exactly how it went

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.800
down dude

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.920
I'll be the first to tell you we

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.450
obviously did not improve our DPS on the

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.660
last floor which definitely made it to

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:21.440
the top of the TSN draft boards as a

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.440
most important thing

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:31.990
Thank You shielded tears PSN is a

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:36.730
Canadian sports network by the way so

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:39.400
we're trying to uh we're trying to kill

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.590
the enemies I mean ideally as soon as we

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:46.000
walk into the room not always going to

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:47.920
be at all realistic but if the strong

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.950
can make it so we could realistically

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.760
you know like four tap them after we hit

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:57.490
them with a straw that's a start so

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.390
right now we're just fairly consistently

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:04.390
eating it from a DPS standpoint but I

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:07.150
think we're going to get you emperor

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.010
lovers lovers card might be important is

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.710
there's a chance this run finds itself

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:15.730
in a state where the lovers card matters

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:18.040
more than I'd like it to ended up being

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.390
worth it I think to do this obviously

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:24.550
the money's now where the whole heck of

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:27.250
a lot in a pretty good situation

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.760
financially speaking but still got to

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.280
try that

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.920
oh that's just that hurts me deep in my

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.510
soul because that that's an admonishment

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.330
of my own character right there that

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:39.460
it's like that damage so the straws

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:43.210
directly feeds off of our actual like

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.200
capital D damage stance so raising our

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.420
rate of fire would be great for our

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.890
shields here set up here but we do need

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.570
literal damage if we're gonna if we're

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.930
going to make the straw pop we could

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:58.600
always choose to roll with a different

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.460
space bar item it seems like this isn't

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.890
going to get the job done we could also

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.240
you know hopefully just ball out with

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:10.870
like an orbital or something like that

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:13.000
and be a little bit less concerned about

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.410
things until our damage pops if it ever

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.390
does and then use straw

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.090
you know productively in that situation

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.880
sure I'll take this I'll take King baby

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:24.820
because I sort of don't see a reason to

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.380
take it or not to take it we're buying

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.390
stuff and it actually worked out for us

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.800
we're buying stuff because we need to

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.660
throw everything at the wall and see

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.850
what sticks to be honest with you

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.800
we did find our second secret room as

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.810
well I'm going to use the tower card on

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:42.070
the boss fight is silly as that might

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:45.670
seem I think it's doubtlessly the right

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:48.250
choice here Steven is a nice damage up

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:51.190
actually very pleasant damage up and all

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.810
around class act so appreciate that

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.830
we're at four point six nine damage now

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.450
straw is going to be much more

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.030
productive I'm still not too far behind

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:05.140
schedule although you know my boss rush

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:06.880
dreams no longer no longer seem as

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.490
applicable with every passing floor they

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.290
get a little bit less likely to come to

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.530
fruition hot and fresh out the kitchen

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.120
I'd say No Deal that's fine but another

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.430
tiers upgrades we really improved

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.310
ourselves DPS wise on like the final

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.730
three rooms there and the more the

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.440
merrier

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.990
forget boss rush for now just focus on

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.110
the smart money which definitely for now

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.750
is uh your HP as low as possible picking

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.010
up some luck upgrades if you can

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.390
leveraging piggy bank this is why we can

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.270
afford to spend so much money and there

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:41.710
we go more HP with a speed upgrade

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:44.290
associated with it as well I actually

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:47.830
feel like we are capable of killing

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:52.150
enemies now so it's a great sign for us

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:54.340
as a as a character here not quite one

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.380
tap at enemies into oblivion yet with

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.470
the straw but you know a good deal with

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.300
the angel here surprising you know

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:04.500
golden chests pay out there Bob's your

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.500
uncle we're off to the races

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:14.220
probably never going to be able to take

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:17.190
advantage of this boss trap room I'm

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:20.639
like mildly more attached than usual to

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:24.120
boss for us right now because the straw

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:27.180
is a good boss rush item but anything

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.160
you can use all the time it is a decent

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.470
choice for boss rush relative to how it

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.480
normally usually so I mean the lovers

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.250
card was not an exceptional pickup there

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.899
are no laws slipped into a cockney

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.639
accent there I don't know why I thought

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:42.149
a cockney accent was Australian

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:44.310
apparently it's offend as many other

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:46.920
Commonwealth countries as I can all at

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.570
once now do you understand it's you

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.510
can't offend Commonwealth countries

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.880
which is not true I say that as a

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:58.769
Canadian has been defended before in my

00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:01.290
life yeah Oh in might fancy a spot of

00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:03.089
ice hockey do you know I don't that's

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.220
very offensive I'm here to get medical

00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:08.699
treatment please I have a splinter in my

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.459
in my elbow I've broken my caucus and

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:15.300
you are being a racist right now but we

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:18.060
have this this permanent all it's so

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.829
good Thank You death touch other

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.750
Commonwealth countries like Canada

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:24.360
included members of these countries can

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:26.640
always bond over Americans being

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.180
insulting to you about your sovereign

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.779
state

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.699
hey have you ever had any Americans come

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:35.430
over to you and ask you if the Queen was

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:39.000
your head of state God certainly have

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:44.370
night all the time

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I'm not laughing this is now like the

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:52.769
the Australian dude on a Ridley Scott

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.199
like alien reboot or held is some action

00:15:52.769 --> 00:15:59.640
down now been itching all the news Mon

00:15:55.199 --> 00:16:01.529
trigger fingers the years right this is

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.050
not meant to be actually Australian it's

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:08.160
just it's meant to be like hey my name

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:12.300
is a Darcy Tucker I'm from Wichita I'll

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.980
be playing Mick Dundee in this film it's

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.529
a ferret Lee brothers joined did I go to

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.839
the shop I don't to go with you to shop

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:21.360
either way like we're actually rolling

00:16:18.839 --> 00:16:21.690
now where it we're in such a good spot

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.940
the

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.770
cost ourselves a lot of HP with nine

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:30.720
lives but I'm happy to have it food and

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:32.610
ex placebo just so lovely we'll always

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.600
have that bond is the queen candidates

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.290
head of state yes

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.330
on a literal level just in the same way

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:43.680
that GlaxoSmithKline is the american

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:44.760
head of state just the same nerves -

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.680
real - real

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.760
don't forget about Procter and Gamble I

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:54.960
did but no the queen is Canada's head of

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:56.850
state on on paper but it's the same way

00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.270
that the queen is also England's head of

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:03.180
state but you know if she ever tried to

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:04.920
be like hey you can't do that they'd be

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.300
like okay now you're no longer England's

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.860
head of state like it's just a nice

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.720
thing that was like steeped in tradition

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.310
and we haven't really gotten around we

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.800
haven't a good reason to get rid of it

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.569
yet you know it's like you got a shirt

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.670
in your closet and you're like that was

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.319
my favorite shirt I don't really wear it

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.579
that much anymore but sometimes I'm like

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:23.240
aw I remember the good times we had in

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:26.610
that shirt those were those are swell

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.620
the actual it's not like the Queen sits

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:32.040
in Parliament here I'm just trying to

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:35.280
dispel a stereos not even a stereotype

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.290
just though it's the falsehood okay I'm

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.380
going to donate we got the cash we got

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.520
the capital and we want the luck to be

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.230
honest with you I think we're going to

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.610
we're going to pop and possibly get the

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.340
boss searched look at that angel deal

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:49.230
chance come up there not that it raises

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:53.010
our devil deal chance to begin with but

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:55.440
you know got a peep it got a check we do

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.810
want to get the ability to fly I'm kind

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:04.890
of surprised that was 6.50 damage I have

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:08.270
not yet I've not yet like one tap

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:11.130
enemies even close to consistently but

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:15.630
the other thing Commonwealth countries

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:17.490
share is people try to do impressions of

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.050
us all the time and then we have to go

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.790
that's not what we sound like like you

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:24.090
probably did earlier on in this episode

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:26.640
as my guest but it always be like oh

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:30.179
you're from Canada oh you're from Canada

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.490
eh oh go down to the Air Canada Centre

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:34.620
watch the Montreal Canadiens shoot

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.940
around the old flippy Paco and you

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.250
oh that's not what we sound like and

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:41.460
they go ho ho this doesn't know what we

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.950
sound like yes right I'm I hear you

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.380
there

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:50.700
Malibu nights in Canada dreams we got

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.200
nothing that's five we went to our shop

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.790
we did not go to our item room

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.790
honestly we got the time here

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:08.080
okay let's go that is our third blood

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:10.480
bag I'm not intending this to be the

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.630
anti-american episode at all you know I

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.220
think even more than most I have a great

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.830
respect for our friends and neighbors

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.870
across the border I go down to the

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.730
United States on many occasions despite

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.770
the fact that your dollar is currently a

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:27.640
currency powerhouse so if you go to

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:30.430
McDonald's it's like $28 Canadian to eat

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.530
a sandwich $28 Canadian what's that like

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.090
40 cents in there see you're doing the

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.700
thing again where you make me not want

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.080
to like you you know in spite of the

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.100
fact that we're in close proximity to

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.750
each other you're making fun of

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.310
somebody's country it's just where they

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.380
were born they got no control over it

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:47.050
Plus cannon is a g8 nation I got nothing

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:55.510
to apologize for okay anyway the point

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:56.740
is ever you bring up America around the

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.870
Canadian or getting all sorts of

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.380
complicated is there's pent up

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:04.060
aggression and misunderstanding and

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.130
resentment and and all sorts of stuff I

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.890
know you're going to be doing the John

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.330
handle I don't think about you at all it

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.440
doesn't bother me through it's just

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.320
that's what happens when you're in the

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.180
shadow you know shadow thinks about the

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.820
Sun does the Sun think about the shadow

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.820
now but sometimes is nice in the shade

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.750
prove me wrong

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:28.240
so we're not gonna make boss rush but I

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:32.260
didn't feel good about just skipping our

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:36.580
item room so if we can get like an

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:39.690
emperor card sign me up we probably will

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.690
not but we might as well look

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:50.000
come yeah okay I'm taking that for the

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:59.240
speed upgrade mostly now I want to like

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:01.160
I want to freaking zip man no come on I

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:05.600
know we got an emperor in here I know we

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:07.970
got an MP murdered-out MP please nothing

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.740
we're it's I mean it's breaking my heart

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.030
here because I know that I want to make

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.190
it but we're not going to be able to

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.500
make boss rush but if we ever were able

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:17.780
to make boss rush 1.95 he is going to

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.740
need enough to do it there's no question

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:26.540
about it this is our last chance

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:29.840
basically two of the imaan days it's

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:31.280
pretty great you again we got to be

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.360
careful not to accidentally blow up our

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.540
donation machine we're kind of getting

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:40.490
down into that range Hermann oh it's

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:42.830
still plausible not likely but plausible

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.020
please teleport worthy room not we got

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.760
to start like this and then you just go

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.750
out and I know you're going to look at

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.270
this you're going to go why would you

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:52.910
ever sacrifice like anything to go to

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:57.890
boss rush with this you just don't

00:21:52.910 --> 00:22:01.400
understand okay dad I still think

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:05.110
there's no chance we make it but there

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.110
might be like a better no chance now

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:16.190
this pains me deep in my soul we have to

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.490
bounce we can't do it we got to it but

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:20.600
we can't do it

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:24.890
it would only would have been better if

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:26.600
that were the Emperor but that's that's

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.600
hard cuz like we worse we were there

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.130
right we were at boss rush but we're at

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.890
the boss fight at least but I was

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:37.670
watching the time there's no conceivable

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:39.200
way we could have made it to the point

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.130
that we killed the boss in time and we

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.080
might have skipped our deal with the

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.520
angel to do it so you know let's keep an

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.930
eye on what's important on this run and

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.470
that's that's having a fun time and

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:52.550
having a fun time is it's going to be

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:53.960
easier to have a fun time if we play

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.940
smart you know play a little sensibly

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.200
altitude absolutely BFF we definitely

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.400
should have bought restock first but

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:03.820
that's fine let's hope it I mean it's

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:09.640
feel pretty good but I was hoping for a

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:11.750
fuller year old heir to the spades

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.760
foolery rule what am I talking about I

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.310
don't know doesn't matter anyway

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.650
good stuff Libra absolutely let's go

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:21.290
damage up speed down

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:26.510
that's actually pretty acceptable I'd

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:27.860
say we're going to go no we're not going

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.480
to go here we don't have an arcade

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:33.470
either so we're pretty much out at this

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:37.550
point I think we did well on our uh on

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:39.140
our shop we don't need more than 32 keys

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.030
I mean if this is a daily we'd maybe

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.230
push it a little harder but let's be

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.840
real here

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.860
okay so we got maybe a few more rerolls

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.790
built in here we should have gone

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:51.470
starter deck but doesn't really matter

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:58.010
this point black candles pretty big

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:59.330
puberty pill is that bad yeah I mean

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.980
there's a double key room back there but

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.960
I don't know I'm not that impressed with

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.390
double key rooms can't believe he made

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.430
it there deserve to get hit no question

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.170
it's one of those ones even people who

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.520
are big fans of mine are like I really

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.810
wish he got hit there so we didn't get

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.810
the idea that that's a good idea

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:20.020
and you know our damage is actually

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.870
better now and our DPS is better because

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.640
our tear rate didn't change this should

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:28.120
tell you everything you need to know we

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:31.210
just can't make it no deal

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.490
dad hurts me because I'm really trying

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:36.730
to make these angel deals pops and

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:39.150
you're not giving me the opportunity the

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:42.760
popper tunity

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:44.050
how many times now have we gone like hey

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.520
first you know what the devil's not that

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.380
good let's try to ride deals with the

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.720
angel on this run and then the game just

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.730
goes about that you're going to miss

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.700
every conceivable deal with the devil

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:56.020
chance that you know on a normal will be

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.940
what the angel chance should say that on

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.330
a normal run would be paying out like

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.220
crazy you know it's like they're

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.260
punishing me for being a dreamer here

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:10.890
who dreams his life away like Ozzy

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:17.550
Osbourne great probably on the best song

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:24.160
I'm just a dreamer I dream my life away

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:28.840
Sharon I'm just the three man a dream

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:31.270
most every day Sharon oh yeah I mean

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.510
that's not nice to just fill of rock

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.830
legends down to a caricature based on

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.260
the show that made them like four

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:42.330
hundred million dollars and a household

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:46.120
name to a younger generation but look

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.830
I'm mining it okay I got no disrespect

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:53.940
for Ozzy Osbourne

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:56.500
I respect Black Sabbath war pigs Ironman

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.660
paranoid great songs dude they're

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.100
probably more than that that I'm unaware

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.130
of because I never really listened to

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:06.300
back catalogue but you know I'm not

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.300
givin them disrespect

00:26:07.429 --> 00:26:14.089
I want to see a new season of The

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:24.519
Casper mattress

00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:37.429
honestly the run has become I wouldn't

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:41.149
say unremarkable the speed down grades

00:27:37.429 --> 00:27:42.979
hurt me in my soul because they're

00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:47.149
actually all stamps down grades when

00:27:42.979 --> 00:27:49.399
they could be all status upgrades but we

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:52.339
need something to make Libra truly pop

00:27:49.399 --> 00:27:57.109
it's not a palpable levels I do love the

00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:58.460
ooh okay it isn't all stats off I was

00:27:57.109 --> 00:28:02.960
worried I would actually be like a mild

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:04.580
all stats down but but what is let me

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.589
give you a small downgrade in something

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.519
I can't recall what it is but I thought

00:28:06.589 --> 00:28:10.249
it did

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:14.200
we need like it doesn't have to be soy

00:28:10.249 --> 00:28:16.429
milk but I wouldn't mind it if it were

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.719
not going to take that I'm happy was I

00:28:16.429 --> 00:28:19.369
do the straws been doing good work for

00:28:17.719 --> 00:28:20.720
us just throw it away like a piece of

00:28:19.369 --> 00:28:21.979
debt reduce

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.999
it's not the way I want to live my life

00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:27.799
man okay never got a much better a

00:28:25.999 --> 00:28:30.619
mildly better chance of making our

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:35.409
dreams work here am I gonna fight hush I

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:38.479
don't know we didn't miss boss rush but

00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:39.679
nine lives without a certain huh skill

00:28:38.479 --> 00:28:45.289
is always dangerous

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:46.849
we do have piercing piercing shielded

00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:50.389
peers so we're really good against

00:28:46.849 --> 00:28:52.879
bullet-hell enemies we do have the like

00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:54.320
a guaranteed mega satan pop as well so

00:28:52.879 --> 00:28:56.479
you know what give me a lump of coal and

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.950
I'll fight Krampus that's our deal you

00:28:56.479 --> 00:29:00.559
got to meet me halfway I'm not like a

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:02.960
say my rookie deal anymore no I'm sorry

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:04.669
I what kind of man would I be if I if I

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.460
proposed this deal to you that was very

00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:12.229
fair and then you just threw it all away

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:14.509
you know again this okay now we got 92

00:29:12.229 --> 00:29:15.919
cents I'll go down to the hospitai the

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:17.989
same my rookie deal though you got to

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:20.929
give me something you know this is an

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:24.409
old earlier Brown James pay you 75 bucks

00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:28.039
a game to you know score 40 points I'm

00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:30.259
getting paid now I'm scoring triple

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:32.599
doubles and you know if you're making

00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:34.669
money off me you need to you need to

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:36.710
toss me that eihwaz card so I appreciate

00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:39.289
that you did there's actually two of

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.700
diamonds that was a big one but okay

00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:44.749
well I mean that's not worth anything

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:49.849
sadly and neither really is this so we

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:53.359
got here we have money tell the children

00:29:49.849 --> 00:29:55.609
now to the left now we're I don't know

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:57.349
we'll try like bleh oh we got restock

00:29:55.609 --> 00:30:05.269
that's right so we should be buying good

00:29:57.349 --> 00:30:07.849
passive students I mean I guess I'd

00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:11.479
rather have mom's box of trinkets yeah I

00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:14.629
mean okay sure um blank card eihwaz I

00:30:11.479 --> 00:30:17.269
don't know give it a shot bear nothing

00:30:14.629 --> 00:30:18.619
go back with the straw we got we got

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:20.119
some stuff out of that and we got a

00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:24.979
little bit more money actually quite a

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:30.470
lot more money here another two items

00:30:24.979 --> 00:30:34.039
close to three I really care what we get

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:34.490
here probably not so think Celtic Cross

00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:37.880
for the

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:41.030
incivility is the wise choice none of

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:44.330
these matters so we'll go more options

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:48.559
nuns have it's fine PhD I think we

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:50.140
should grab sorry donation machine had

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:55.370
to be done

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:57.770
pay to play is not worth it all right

00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:05.660
well it was a whiff but it wasn't like a

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:08.050
huge whiff almost trying to escape all

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.050
right buddy

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.290
okay you want to come in I mean I can

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.700
just hold the button down and fight

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:15.710
those guys we'd like to enter the room

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.420
it's really up to you is there no food

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:20.630
in the food dish when it rotated is this

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:22.520
what you're trying to tell me it will be

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.260
handled it will be handled they're

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.670
freaking out yeah there's definitely no

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.040
food in the food dish when an auto

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.960
rotated it's the thing you know we got

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.640
this Auto rotator for the food dish so

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.910
you fill in like six days of food at a

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.740
time but now we need an auto filler to

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.850
fill it once every seven days we got

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:43.040
like the whole rimworld

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:46.520
philosophy going on right now this it's

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:49.520
not automation yet it's just you know

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:52.330
automation no feeding don't give me food

00:31:49.520 --> 00:32:01.010
if it's been six days and Riesling do

00:31:52.330 --> 00:32:04.990
2dc 2dc 2dc - this is my meow retorts

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.990
see I knew there was something in there

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:15.490
some rotation no feeding don't give a

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:18.690
fuck if I scratch you're all bleed they

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.690
do give a fudge I think

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:33.730
this is like the most yawn worthy hush

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:36.550
fight yawn gonna make me win this fight

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:40.930
up in here up in here

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:44.170
yawn gonna make me ball out up in here

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:48.310
up in here y'all gonna make me look real

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:54.880
cool up in here up in here don't forget

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:58.050
to stay in school up in here like just

00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:01.990
sanitize songs all day every day every

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:05.080
night but I'm just I really thought we'd

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:07.690
be kind of having a little bit more cook

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.430
spa on this run we don't I mean I don't

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:11.800
even know if the Holy Light show I know

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:16.120
they're the Holy Light shots are sending

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:17.440
beams of light down I thought maybe

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.040
because they were piercing they didn't

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:28.270
count as having collided for that reason

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:31.660
but no just give me the easy way out

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:34.420
here I mean you're dead I could be hit

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.600
but you will be dead so I really like it

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:43.810
if you could just stop trying to survive

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:46.120
here is lump of coal an all stats

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:47.800
upgrade when your shots travel a long

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.220
distance because of the fact that we

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.220
have Libra

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.240
it sounded like it was a setup to a

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.710
punchline but obviously that wasn't the

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.650
case because if there's any labs that he

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:01.090
had I didn't get to experience them

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:04.840
there um

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:09.310
cathedral cap he drill never mind

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:11.590
Spanish and feed these cans we're

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:15.400
looking for year of runes

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:17.919
and apart from that a nice ad upgrade is

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:23.440
an all stats upgrade as long as it

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:24.760
doesn't carry a penalty like a stat

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.860
penalty associated with it as well like

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:30.370
number one I was thinking of great rate

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:31.960
of fire increase does it actually count

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:34.390
as an all stats upgrade with Libra

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.590
because it does nerve fuel range sure it

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:39.700
does great things to your rate of fire

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:41.050
but destroys your range the answer the

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:47.980
question is very simple I don't know

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:52.870
maybe it does maybe it doesn't either

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:54.669
way we are like beyond safe we've killed

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:57.910
the only boss that that should be able

00:34:54.669 --> 00:35:00.250
to have a chance to stop us and then we

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:02.020
have nine lives so I mean the mega satan

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:09.000
fight admittedly could throw things into

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:11.080
a bit of a tizzy but I'm I mean

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.520
justifiably doubtful I think would be

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:17.470
the correct way to phrase this just

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.690
we've got a hive mind just just give me

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:21.340
the Joker card let me get goofy it's not

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:24.760
the runs have been tough lately it's

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:26.320
just been a while I don't get the I

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.720
don't get the guppy pals as often as

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.930
usual or as uh as often as I used to it

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:35.650
should say but sure I mean you got the

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:37.950
wafer can't deny that still can't fly

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:41.560
either

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:44.230
small rock it wouldn't even be that

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.270
valuable with Libra something with like

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.010
Libra is like indefensible most of the

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:54.040
time I think it largely contributes to

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:56.610
runs being bad but still love it come on

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.610
come on

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:02.510
just getting a little silly here I'm

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:06.290
starting to tilt that's usually a good

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:08.270
sign it's like my last advisable to be

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:10.430
the last Isaac run of the day is when I

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:16.040
start to tilt off the face of the

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:17.840
stratosphere here now wouldn't say I'm

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.640
on the face of the stratosphere or off

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.560
the face of the stratosphere but you

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:25.760
know I'm starting to tilt can't deny it

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:28.220
so that means they'll probably do one

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.200
more get bad stuff and lose early

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.870
because of a you know compromise mental

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.940
position is a little is morale to

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:37.610
staying in one you know good mental

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:42.920
state over the course of a run there's a

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:44.450
science to it I'm not necessarily a

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.640
hundred percent privy to it we're doing

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:48.140
fine I mean you know look at our stats

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.830
and tell me I should be tilted just

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:54.080
don't pee down my neck and tell me it's

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:56.870
raining so with no yarrow room we're

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.030
gonna open all the stuff we might go

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:02.540
just explore for a little bit at least

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:03.800
small rooms because I do I I mean we

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.720
don't need to straw anymore that's

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.210
that's the straight and narrow of it so

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:13.850
I think we'll take this probably blow

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:14.360
this up and gas lock up okay lock up

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.880
okay

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.830
puberty moving towards that stat upgrade

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.610
so the stat of welders that help upgrade

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:26.030
at least then you d8 yourself I'm going

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:29.470
to say every v8 or at least maybe every

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:31.970
d8 actually will be an all stats up I

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:35.060
might be a wishfully thinking a little

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:36.530
bit there seven lucky means I want to

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.700
explore a little bit we actually I'm

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.620
glad I didn't forget me now because that

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.240
means you can't fight megacity sure we

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.910
get another set of items like right off

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.260
the bat foot it's sort of like we would

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:47.360
seven luck we should be able to create

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.410
as many items as as we'd be getting by

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.060
using the forget-me-now and then

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.660
everybody's in the same boat you know we

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.540
all win

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:56.870
ah no sometimes it's an all stats

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:59.690
downgrade I guess it's there's probably

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:01.850
like an array of possibilities now I'm

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:04.040
not making this just about like oh dae

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.910
taking one programming class but now

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.560
there's probably like an array of

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.650
possibilities and some of them are very

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.360
good and give you

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.800
like a net positive gain some of them

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.370
give you a net negative but because we

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.510
have Libra a net negative is actually a

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:17.600
distributed negative to every stat that

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.920
can be affected and a net positive is an

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.220
amazing positive that's a distributed

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.810
one to everyone that can benefit from

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:31.470
the upgrade in the first place that's

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:34.170
another downgrade hoping to hoping to

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:40.470
beat the feed the system on this one

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:45.810
here there we go we're back at speed

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:48.060
which it means everything hangman let us

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:52.500
keep your hand

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:57.510
don't forget what the goodness is a good

00:38:52.500 --> 00:39:03.600
man or bad fan it's a Seinfeld theme

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:08.760

said George Costanza fits in there

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:16.380

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.930
that one so we're you know I don't want

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:27.060
