00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.460
everybody welcome back northernlion The

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.200
Binding of Isaac after birth plus I'm

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.010
doing a daily challenge I'm going to try

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.870
something new

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.340
yesterday's daily was not actually that

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.280
bad but I've been playing bad Isaac

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.650
lately here's our daily not looking at

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.230
the scores and take a second to pet

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
Telmo hey Tomo give me your energy for

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.310
this run please buddy this is a run that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.199
should go to delirium I don't know what

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.730
the scores are today I don't know what

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.500
my ranking was yesterday but it was

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
probably finished in like the 500s and I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.280
guess not that bad considering we

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.260
whipped on it pretty hard at a certain

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.290
point at least I am going to go to our

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.690
cursed room here cursed images and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.260
really I just need I'm mixing things up

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.390
now at what point do I realize that my

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.219
slump breaking mechanics have not been

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.620
working as effectively as I'd like you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.539
know first I was like we got a good

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.070
burst first I was like we got to keep

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.930
everything the same just keep doing it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.809
the same you win with the same stress

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.720
most of the time variances screw when

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.920
you don't get it twisted and then that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.450
didn't get me out of the slump as

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.909
quickly as I'd like and then I said okay

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.210
let's mix it up try playing is the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.229
keeper try playing is the loft that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.720
didn't work either

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.170
so you know what today I'm taking the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.909
pressure off what is this two staves

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.360
it's actually pretty great right now but

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.820
we really really would like to encounter

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.079
a single bomb wait there's a red heart

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.090
in our shop we should go back to that

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.979
just because it is relevant right now

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.380
I'm trying to get one more penny if

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.020
possible as well because we could get to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.070
our shop which is sadly up there I say

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.659
sadly because there could have been a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.820
library or something right there it was

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.329
right next to our spawn room but that's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.579
okay as well bombs are so valuable here

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.509
we have tinted rocks and we have secret

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.040
room chances and obviously we have that

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.719
stone chest as well and the stone chest

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.340
is like the most valuable of all of them

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.180
so I'll just tell you straight up this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.530
is like the worst possible boss to fight

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.759
on this floor to the best of my

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.470
knowledge you know there's there's

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.940
several Ragman

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.250
of the champion persuasion I don't know

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.340
if this is the worst one I'm pretty sure

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.740
this is the one that just spawns like 20

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.400
spiders and then after you kill them he

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.590
just walks around raising them over and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.240
over and over so like ride man is most

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.770
vulnerable when he spawns his head

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.810
because he takes damage when you shoot

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.520
the head but then also he doesn't really

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.720
attack you during that phase either as

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.240
long as you don't walk into the head

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.100
you're usually pretty good so we got to

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.720
strike an unfortunate balance here

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.400
between crowd control and also dealing

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.810
damage to this guy himself he's got like

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.190
a Duke of flies thing going on where

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.010
he's kind of got like you've got

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.230
protection the thing as long as we don't

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.140
get it too twisted we should live for

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.120
certain real question is whether or not

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.850
champion rag man does one full heart of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.740
damage because if he does we're going to

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.870
be displeased if he doesn't we're

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.710
probably fine for is it for spiders is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.700
too many this is too many spiders I

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.500
don't know if there's a limit to the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.820
number that he can resurrect as well

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.590
like there's a limit to the number that

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.510
he can spawn you might be able to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.850
resurrect all of the dead ones forever

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.620
so I'm not I'm not too bummed out about

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.750
getting hit once although it was

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.010
preventable damage this is a tough boss

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.250
fight that's going to annoy a lot of

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.620
people we got bombs back okay so we're

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.690
going to be very very slow leaving this

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.550
floor but we should make up for it later

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.130
hopefully this is the second secret room

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.130
it is not but we do get a spear at hard

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.730
our regular secret room is in kind of a

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.660
weird potential location that's

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.540
extremely good

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.650
and the luck upgrade is very nice as

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.600
well like that's not going to be the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.030
secret room so this is almost certainly

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.420
the secret room what we could basically

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:13.070
go to the shop for free right now but

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.840
I'm going to abstain all right well at

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.790
this point there's really only one

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.440
possible location for this all right

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.970
well disregard that I don't know why I

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.670
wasted all those bombs but hey at least

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.710
we got all those consumables and we've

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.470
got more money more than enough money I

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.670
should say to spawn a blood bank on this

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.960
floor which would be very nice for us

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.610
unfortunately I have no bombs with which

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.100
to access that area over there but you

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.140
know what big things have small

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.630
beginnings what we got here

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.090
High Priestess good card use that

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.650
immediately on the boss and save voids

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.290
that we have already we want to get like

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.270
a damage upgrade as soon as possible

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.280
void is one of the easiest ways we can

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.040
make that happen little horn would have

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.320
been super annoying we definitely do not

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:59.590
care about Plan C but I do care about

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.000
precedent so I'm going to grab that

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.880
despite of being effectively useless we

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.100
got a damage in a shot speed increase

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.410
good especially considering we got a lot

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.000
of floor left to take care of here so

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.550
that actually was pretty solid too his

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.530
fades gives us it means we have three

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.680
keys right now effectively and we

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.180
probably want to start going to the shop

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.160
just on the off-chance that is one of

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.960
the lucky shops seven cents is enough to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.520
possibly make things work and you know

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.990
there is an exploration bonus tied to it

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.300
as well all right I'm feeling I'm

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.950
feeling relaxed I'm feeling better I'm

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.590
putting too much pressure on myself I

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.200
know that it's a very self-serving thing

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.260
to say is like putting so much pressure

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.110
on myself in my extremely stressful line

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.330
of work but now I've been way too

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.270
focused on the results of Isaac and

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.500
sometimes when you focus on the results

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.660
distracts from actually achieving them

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.800
you know sometimes it can be helpful

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.270
you're going to write an exam and it's

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.560
only got one question the teacher let

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.120
you know what the essay question was

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.650
going to be ahead of time you should

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.919
prepare yourself to be able to write

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.690
that essay there's no question about it

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.940
we don't really want to suck up to D 10

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.100
I'd rather just save the

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.040
arge honestly but in a lot of cases

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.040
think the best way to prepare for an

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.390
exam just to learn the material focus on

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.360
making sure you know what has a good

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.590
chance to be taught now that I've gotten

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.690
that preaching that's out of the way

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.740
what I mean to say is never do your

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.260
homework that's not true I don't know

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.820
what I want your staffs I guess amnesia

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.890
is basically irrelevant

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.610
I wanted bombs - but no pill can give

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.840
you bombs if you don't have keys so we

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.900
haven't been to the shop yet right I

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.940
think we should buy a bomb if there is

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.010
one we're not going to be able to get

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.470
the humbling bundle like this so we

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.390
should grab this bomb and then hope that

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.100
we get secret room and we can open the

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.630
golden chest and the golden chest gives

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.630
us enough money to get a humbling bundle

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:02.710
sometimes you can get an extra penny or

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:05.410
something out of this - two cents that's

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.960
something then you use a bomb here you

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.150
get a bomb back anyway we do get the

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.950
secret room you've got two bombs

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.990
we got a vore pill that could have

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.540
caused me some serious problems and now

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.720
we need keys we want keys to get Black

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.400
Lotus okay well we got three bombs we

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.780
can get one key very easily we don't

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.540
even need to go to our shop and spend

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:29.590
money and we're going to use another

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.990
bomb now we got to make sure we get this

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.120
we also need to speed up that's like I

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.400
hope that that's fairly obvious there's

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.590
Black Lotus it's very very nice HP

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.990
upgrade but I think apart from that

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:47.890
we're just we're gone that's life and

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:49.690
let's move on I think we'll go to the

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.800
cursor yeah we shouldn't go just yet I

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.360
mean I know we're a minute behind

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.730
schedule I want to minimize backtracking

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:59.230
but if we get like guppies head in there

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.760
we want to have void ready to play we

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.890
don't want to have to walk back in so

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.860
I'm going to peep these rooms I don't

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:08.830
really want to but I also want to get

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.840
charges as soon as possible so what kind

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.610
of torn here we have to do hush and I

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.080
know that like I said that yesterday and

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:19.810
we ended up missing hush and still doing

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:20.770
okay not amazing but okay today we have

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:25.810
to do hot

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:27.789
that's where the points come in because

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.069
we got to get to the Delirium floor so

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:31.990
we even if we miss boss rush that's not

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:36.159
a cataclysmic thing although it would be

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:38.440
bad gotta do hush so what's the big

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.479
winner for you as apollyon by the way

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.330
really we can find one library that has

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:46.649
a Book of Revelations or a Satanic Bible

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:50.470
in it we pretty much win the game I

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:52.860
think at least but I had I've been known

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.510
to be wrong before sure okay

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:59.560
he's too fast this is an enemy that's

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.940
too fast for us I don't I can't take

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.570
advantage of the battery charge so let's

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.070
just move on all right not too rattled a

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.600
little bit of damage but I wouldn't

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:11.890
describe it as bad damage you know with

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.020
base speed and still relatively average

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.870
damage you're going to get hit from time

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:21.520
to time especially by enemies that chase

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:23.890
you down an hour tanky as heck we're

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.730
lucky we've got the resiliency to

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:31.990
survive mentally and or no but in terms

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:36.550
of our in terms of our stats especially

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.800
HP for certain so that is like case

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.420
number one

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.890
first off greatest dodge I've ever made

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.990
secondly that's case number one for why

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:49.899
we need to stack items on void because

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.520
once every six rooms mom's bra not

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:54.130
really crushing it yet we do have

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.940
battery charges back there though so we

00:09:54.130 --> 00:10:01.209
can recover the quarter it's really good

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.920
if we can get some more keys I don't

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:05.410
like our character is dressed for a

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.490
funeral right now I also don't like how

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:13.930
I just pronounced funeral counterfeit

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:17.079
pennies also great like to expedite this

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:18.670
whole process of getting strong if you

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:20.200
could just drop one of the items that

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.750
makes us strong immediately like it was

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:26.470
the matrix that would be awesome I'll

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:28.270
use a bomb here and this is great this

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:32.350
is actually amazing black rune is so

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:33.930
good for us it's like a version of the

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.779
void that hates bad

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.720
active you know it turns them into into

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:46.200
stats could save us a lot of hassle a

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:48.210
was is not necessary but not necessarily

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.610
without use either it's a weird sense

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.380
say algae's is also nice but first pop a

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.209
was just get it out here see what you

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.839
get then I think we take algae's into

00:10:54.209 --> 00:11:03.570
our room here this is kind of an

00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:05.160
interesting call nightlight is okay

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.690
especially at fighting hush so I think

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.610
I'm going to grab it and I think I'm

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:12.630
going to grab this just to save us the

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:15.330
time of walking back and then I'm going

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.500
to go fight hush not hush whatever the

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.570
boss is on this floor

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.010
you can't know yet but I'm going to take

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.709
the black rune in with me

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:26.959
it would be maybe best to take algae's

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:31.890
but the black rune allows us to reroll

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:34.020
bad active items into stat increases on

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.899
the deal with the devil if we're lucky

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.370
enough to get one so at this point you

00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:42.900
got to acknowledge we probably should

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:44.160
have taken Telmo you can exit in a

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.730
moment buddy we probably should have

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.260
taken algae's this is a small pestilence

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.959
fight is extremely annoying we

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.390
definitely want the orbital so we'll

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:56.310
take that and then that's it so we'll

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:59.850
grab this grab this we're going to take

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:01.050
black room with us does blacker and do

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.610
anything on the shops because we have

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.250
another one back here nah does nothing

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.110
all right so we're going to go back grab

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.430
black rune don't need al just go down to

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.529
the next floor still a min of iron

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:15.240
scheduled for boss rush but also still

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:19.200
live in life didn't really improve much

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:25.709
on that floor but didn't you know throw

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:28.589
throw the dream away but we're urging

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:31.170
Lee kind of requiring the speed up right

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:32.579
now these enemies are predictable enough

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:36.570
oh jeez

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:38.040
okay well yep this is a little dicey in

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.329
here but I'm going to say these enemies

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.490
are predictable enough that we can use

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:44.910
our orbital to to hurt them pretty badly

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:48.140
but the beam enemies are the ones that

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:51.029
are the the biggest pain in the butt

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.680
just 4.5 damage is not going to carry us

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:55.140
too much longer this is exactly what we

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.940
asked for so far be it for me to

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:00.360
complain we're going to pick it up use

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:02.430
it Quinn okay and then we're going to

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.959
grab this now we're getting mad spirit

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.339
arts every time you get a battery charge

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:06.750
that's a spirit heart once every six

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:10.980
rooms if we got nothing better to use it

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:13.589
on we're going to be stoked these are

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.000
the wrong enemies to use orbital damage

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:16.320
against but to be honest with you we

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.769
might end up having to do it just by

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.230
virtue of you know them not dying until

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:24.000
they get right up in our face so try to

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.510
kite them along as long as possible here

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.339
but so don't I think another thing I'm

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:33.120
guilty of is is it's the number one pet

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:36.510
peeve I have for myself and I'm falling

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.730
victim to it we just suck that up get

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.410
luck and shot speed it's okay at least

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.240
but it what I was going to say and now

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.589
it's thankfully not an issue is don't

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.899
get too cute with the black room you

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:47.490
know if you think you find a situation

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:54.300
where the black room seems useful just

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:56.160
go for it like we do not lose by getting

00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:01.529
a luck upgrade you know we lose by

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:04.230
getting nothing out of out of that black

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:05.670
room so thankfully we've at least gotten

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.890
some value out of this you know I've

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:11.010
done enough dailies in my in my life

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:15.390
here to know that we're in a bit of a

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:18.329
tight spot here on time the runs tend to

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:20.700
get slower as they go along not faster

00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:23.339
you know those first floors the enemies

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:30.410
are easier there's less space less rooms

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:32.850
I guess I should say we should really

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:37.500
really I mean like I want to go to the

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:39.270
shop I really do so we got a we got to

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.649
get out ahead of this one we're not even

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.620
going to have a battery charge which is

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:44.850
extremely unfortunate but if we want to

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.079
have any chance of making it the boss

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.079
direction think we got to go for it here

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.999
I'm a little a little predicting this

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.550
Daly's not going to be the necessarily

00:14:54.999 --> 00:15:00.040
you know highest added daily of all time

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.829
we have taken what I would consider like

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.339
almost every available up that was so

00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:05.259
bad

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:08.709
almost every available opportunity to

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:11.110
create damage upgrades out of nothing we

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:13.809
want to take that just yet and the

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.160
reason was actually very astute it sucks

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:16.660
we got a I think we got to look for a

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.610
battery charges we're taking the deaths

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.839
touch anyway didn't get a battery charge

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.249
but got something good because it would

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:24.420
have been nice to suck up book of sin

00:15:21.249 --> 00:15:27.639
but not the end of the world either way

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.079
experimental treatment did give us every

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:31.480
stat that we wanted except speed

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:32.860
basically but the the damage upgrade is

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.360
really nice there it didn't give us any

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:38.949
bad stats is what I mean to say alright

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.209
so that was not a perfect floor we

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:41.499
didn't get to go to the shop we didn't

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:43.300
get the suck out book of sin but

00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:44.620
all-in-all I think we actually improved

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.870
ourselves a great deal there we got a

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.970
nice all this is so good we got a nice

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.399
damage upgrade in the form of death

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.990
touch and then experimental treatment

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:54.759
was pretty good as well we got closer to

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.220
the bookworm transformation and we're

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:58.959
still holding steady at a minute behind

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.899
schedule for boss rush but I mean

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:04.209
obviously it's not perfect but it's not

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:06.249
terrible we actually do now thanks to

00:16:04.209 --> 00:16:10.209
Booker book of revelations have like a

00:16:06.249 --> 00:16:12.100
good reason to use the void every six

00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:13.449
rooms you know previously we've just

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.480
been a whole not honest thing nothing to

00:16:13.449 --> 00:16:17.800
deal with is like a old prophylactic you

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.110
got stuck in your wallet or something

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.779
like that and now you got I don't know

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.490
this is getting into an uncomfortable

00:16:21.779 --> 00:16:28.389
analogy the point is you shouldn't keep

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:29.740
a prophylactic in your wallet because

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:31.600
that's where you keep your money and you

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.709
wouldn't want your money to get dirty no

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.269
that's you know everyone knows this I

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:39.399
think it's one of the one of the

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:42.100
ultimate rules of condoms you never keep

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:47.050
them in your wallet you never put on two

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:49.899
of them and then you know when in doubt

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.339
you can use it as a sweet little joke

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.480
mechanic you put it over your head and

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:54.639
then blow it up with your nose and you

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.230
look like a cool dude so we were going

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:58.089
to take demon baby demon baby is fine

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.350
I'm not sure if you notice but we have

00:16:58.089 --> 00:17:00.800
suffered a little bit in the damage

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:06.459
department so I'm

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:09.650
uh fairly content I'm going to go for it

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:11.480
that went fine I'm fairly content to

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.490
take something that hurts enemies to get

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.329
close to me seems like that's going to

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.530
be important for us on this run any

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.089
extra damage dealing source is something

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:25.130
I can't afford to turn up my nose at

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:27.949
right now we do have the shot spa we

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.809
have the shot speed necessary to hurt

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:31.730
these guys pretty good from pretty far

00:17:29.809 --> 00:17:36.170
across the map unfortunately our speed

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:37.700
itself is actually god-awful so you know

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.170
it's nice that we got pace when it comes

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.140
to killing enemies but we need to speed

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:45.230
ourselves up as well you know I mean you

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:49.190
could buy caffeine pill and then suck it

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:53.000
up but I don't actually care caffeine

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:54.559
pills not good enough not enough present

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.840
circumstances anyway so at this point

00:17:54.559 --> 00:18:03.500
I'd say we save our oh that's pretty

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:06.470
good I'd say we save our voice charge

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:11.809
and try to use it make sure we can get

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:13.370
through whatever we get from our boss

00:18:11.809 --> 00:18:14.960
fight here and I know that we've got

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.710
more stuff to do on this floor but we

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.790
really really have to bounce you know

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.530
sometimes you can only read the synopsis

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.809
sometimes you can only get the spark

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.800
notes you can't get the whole book I

00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:26.960
mean come on To Kill a Mockingbird

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.530
that's like 200 pages I don't have time

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.960
for that

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:36.770
the NL s s is on teacher now the sun

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:40.010
card is amazing as long as we don't get

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.540
okay that's the most beautiful debt the

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.700
sun card is amazing as long as we don't

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:47.710
get curse with the lost on the next

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:49.340
floor grab that grab this next floor

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:53.510
didn't get a deal with the devil

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:56.570
completely okay sick okay so we walk

00:18:53.510 --> 00:19:01.580
into one room pop this immediately do we

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:03.470
want the left hand why not why did you

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:07.220
not get affected by mom's bra that seems

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:09.080
wrong okay come over here I'm not

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.970
necessarily expecting to be Gubbi but

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.240
you know I wouldn't turn on my nose at

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.240
it either

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:23.129
you know what let's check it fairly

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:26.070
worth it I'd say the game plan on this

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:28.529
floor is really you know make it to boss

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.749
rush if we make it to boss rush void is

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:34.669
okay and I'm not going to say it's the

00:19:30.749 --> 00:19:39.019
best void of all time but we do have a

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:39.019
spirit heart coming out on the regular

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:44.580
just start by working your way to the

00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:46.529
boss fight just in case we do have a

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.259
spirit are coming out on the regular and

00:19:46.529 --> 00:19:51.719
mom's bra is not necessarily bad if we

00:19:49.259 --> 00:19:54.450
get our deal with the devil at least you

00:19:51.719 --> 00:19:56.609
know we might have extra damage to kill

00:19:54.450 --> 00:20:00.450
the enemies while they're in that very

00:19:56.609 --> 00:20:02.039
very short mom's bra state which if I

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:06.239
had to give a state to the mom's bras

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:08.219
state I'm going to say New Mexico why

00:20:06.239 --> 00:20:09.839
New Mexico I don't know what I've taken

00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:12.029
other states as the butt of jokes before

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:13.799
I don't think I've ever rag on New

00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:16.139
Mexico because I mean you always just

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:18.089
forget that it exists this has been the

00:20:16.139 --> 00:20:19.469
northernlion 50 states tour it's like a

00:20:18.089 --> 00:20:21.450
twisted fevered dream of searching

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:23.339
Stevens what do we got here battery

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:31.229
charge three cents it's actually a

00:20:23.339 --> 00:20:36.269
pretty good deal we should be able to

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:38.700
kill mom not with it being super forever

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:40.409
what am I trying to say here that was an

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.359
expression that made no sense well again

00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:44.179
that is mom shouldn't be that tough

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:47.729
because we got a second level Cuba me

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:50.339
it's not a great item always but a great

00:20:47.729 --> 00:20:53.940
item against mom without a doubt dude

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:55.919
just give me like Necronomicon as my as

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.460
my other space bar item that's all I ask

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:58.139
for it

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.759
I'll take angry fly but I should have

00:20:58.139 --> 00:21:02.669
saved a battery charge to suck it up we

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:04.889
just ran out of time to go back and and

00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:09.629
get it changed but angry fly is pretty

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:11.489
terrible and I always do this I always

00:21:09.629 --> 00:21:13.200
go I'll just do one more room and then I

00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:14.909
go to the boss fight and it's like no no

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.129
no no no no what was I thinking on it or

00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:18.779
not okay so get the battery charge I

00:21:17.129 --> 00:21:20.669
don't think we already use the other

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:23.490
battery charger figure out 35 seconds to

00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:27.100
beat mom we should be okay

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:31.090
for myriad reasons but I'd rather not

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:35.730
use the void much better to use it to

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.730
suck up some of those boss rush items

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:43.930
that was a great moment for us and

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:47.440
therefore the world that's fine not

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:49.300
sweating it take the Polaroid going the

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.400
boss rush we have ten seconds to spare

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.650
buddy oh do it okay so this is tough

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:57.370
because I would love to suck these up I

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:59.170
would also love to just get epic AK but

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:02.440
you don't do that what you do instead is

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:05.170
grab this and then you have Tech X and

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.900
you just go crazy because you're a god

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:10.060
now Tech X is better than I mean that's

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:14.980
the best like commendation I can give

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:17.200
the Tech X it's better than wow all of

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.590
those items put together including

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:24.580
ipecac which is an item that like

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:25.930
probably you know ninety let's make it

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.090
an odd number so it makes sense like

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.640
ninety seven out of a hundred times I

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.230
would I would take that on boss rush

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.780
because it just changes your fortune so

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:39.520
easily Tech X is just that much better

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:42.730
so we're in an amazing spot as far as

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:46.600
I'm concerned we do need to or at least

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:48.790
would like to finish this boss rush in

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.400
an expedited fashion because we have to

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:53.050
go to the hospitai however as compared

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.630
to yesterday's run we're so much better

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.250
equipped I'm trying to spam out shots

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:01.510
here by the way it's not as easy as you

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:03.720
might expect also some of the enemies

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:07.330
are unaffected by mom's bra which

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.740
threatens and offends me but what are

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:14.160
you doing they're angry fly just sort of

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:22.150
hanging about huh hey old man what Sheen

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:24.330
Wilhemina people bag of Doritos there we

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.330
go

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.070
if human giant old yet trying to think

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:33.040
like you know human shine was an mtv

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.690
sketch show that was contemporary when i

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.460
was in the middle of my university

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.410
career how does these sans re of course

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.970
very famous for parks of recreation is

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:44.560
stand-up specials and also the excellent

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.870
Netflix original series master of none

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.580
and then Paul Scheer of course famous

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.600
for the how did this get made podcast

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.010
and then also these on the league which

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.290
is probably what is more well known for

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:58.720
and also Rob Huebel who you may know as

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.550
the dude who plays the dude who fucks

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.590
the main characters life in every movie

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:06.520
ever he's always the scumbag dude who's

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:08.110
like you know one level higher at the

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.000
company than you are and he's like sorry

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.530
dude you know I you just know I had to

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.540
tap that he's got a great face for

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:19.990
playing a dick bag but I think like that

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:21.940
is now probably as old as mr. show was

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:25.480
when I started watching mr. show which

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:28.570
is a scary thought for me you know

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:32.200
because that means that I'm on the verge

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:34.120
of almost being a little bit old not

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.120
quite old but old enough that people who

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.300
are 19 are like you lived through a

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.880
different era and it's true man yeah

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:49.810
that's right I had Napster come and get

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:51.700
me pigs I ain't ever scared so at this

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:54.310
point we are basically just using void

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:57.790
as if it's mom's bra it's not a great

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:59.380
look for us right now coming soon I

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.770
don't know why I said that is if I

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:07.960
worked for a movie theater we should

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:09.340
start to consider not using void not

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.040
just because we're basically at full HP

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.690
but because we want to possibly be able

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.870
to suck up whatever the remaining item

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:18.370
is that we get when we finish this this

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.440
boss rush we got to be getting somewhat

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.000
close like we're not we're not killing

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.240
things too quickly our rate of fire is a

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.350
little too bad for us to be getting

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.350
through here in record time but

00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:33.389
yeah I don't think we should use this

00:25:31.409 --> 00:25:37.919
all we're getting out of it is mom's bra

00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:39.899
which is like the ultimate who cares the

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:41.579
existence of mom's bra functionally

00:25:39.899 --> 00:25:43.709
changes like almost nothing if we had

00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:46.019
one HP and we were on a room with things

00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:49.259
chasing us down yeah give me mom's bra

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:52.379
but but we're not so now we can go pick

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:55.739
up this Black Card thank you for not

00:25:52.379 --> 00:25:57.599
hitting me I mean you can tell I'm a few

00:25:55.739 --> 00:26:00.450
thousand points below where I like to be

00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:01.919
at this point on a boss rush I don't

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.419
know if that's par for the course on

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:05.399
today's daily because I didn't look at

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:06.779
the scores is that a strategy that's

00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:09.329
working out for me I don't know I

00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:12.289
consider myself skeptical enough that

00:26:09.329 --> 00:26:14.879
you know I know variance is a thing and

00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:17.669
many things can have an impact on our

00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:19.169
performance right so I wouldn't deign to

00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:21.059
suggest that my new philosophical

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:26.789
mindset for today has made any

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:28.139
difference whatsoever I think we're a

00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:29.309
few thousand points lower because I

00:26:28.139 --> 00:26:31.919
didn't really get a good chance to

00:26:29.309 --> 00:26:34.289
explore just stood there and watch that

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:37.379
shot come in I didn't really get a good

00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:39.619
chance to explore or try to like max out

00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:42.899
any consumables or anything like that

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:44.969
predominantly because we were so weak

00:26:42.899 --> 00:26:46.950
that we had to rush from basically like

00:26:44.969 --> 00:26:48.450
the second floor onwards actually from

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:53.159
the first floor onwards the champion

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:55.109
Ragman set us back like to be out of

00:26:53.159 --> 00:26:56.940
that floor by like 90 seconds I give

00:26:55.109 --> 00:26:58.409
myself three minutes but if you can get

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.499
out of that floor by 90 seconds you're

00:26:58.409 --> 00:27:10.229
in a good spot okay so I'd like to be

00:27:01.499 --> 00:27:16.129
done with boss rush like right now ideal

00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:16.129
outcome here by the way did you die

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:25.099
we can't we got a huge tears upgrade

00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:28.069
that's very nice um ideal item would

00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:30.139
have been speed but in a way shot speed

00:27:28.069 --> 00:27:32.179
not shopping sorry rate of fire does

00:27:30.139 --> 00:27:37.549
allow us to circumvent having pretty bad

00:27:32.179 --> 00:27:38.809
speed because it means that I can kill

00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:40.819
enemies before they can get to me

00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:42.679
because I can just spam shots or at

00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:44.899
least I can spam them more easily than I

00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:46.579
used to be able to at least so we're

00:27:44.899 --> 00:27:50.209
definitely uh you know we got our eyes

00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:51.769
peeled for the hush fight now what I

00:27:50.209 --> 00:27:53.689
mean to say by that of course because

00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:58.159
I'm the nine-year-old man is and do the

00:27:53.689 --> 00:27:59.899
hush fight this did it did it did it I

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:01.819
mean I could I know the whole tune of

00:27:59.899 --> 00:28:03.229
the hustle I can just keep doing that

00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:05.329
for the next 15 minutes but that would

00:28:03.229 --> 00:28:07.849
be a new low I think as far as my

00:28:05.329 --> 00:28:09.739
YouTube content is concerned although I

00:28:07.849 --> 00:28:11.689
don't know I did die three times as a

00:28:09.739 --> 00:28:13.539
polygon in a video this week and do it

00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:16.489
daily where I walked into the trophy

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:19.849
accidentally in a just Cataclysm of

00:28:16.489 --> 00:28:22.069
disaster so we again you know we could

00:28:19.849 --> 00:28:23.689
Book of Revelations with a nail I think

00:28:22.069 --> 00:28:27.049
we will because I don't mind getting a

00:28:23.689 --> 00:28:28.609
third level and some it's not the end of

00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:36.229
the world I don't mind getting a third

00:28:28.609 --> 00:28:37.759
level of bandage girl probably second

00:28:36.229 --> 00:28:39.079
level is better but we don't have any

00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:41.809
permanent polaroid invincibility or

00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:44.049
anything to compromise who right so it's

00:28:41.809 --> 00:28:46.669
a shame actually we got teleported

00:28:44.049 --> 00:28:48.949
because I might like to suck up that

00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:51.289
item although since we're not on boss

00:28:48.949 --> 00:28:53.599
rush anymore we're living in a post boss

00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:54.349
rush world Krampus is head is not that

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:55.999
useful anymore

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:59.709
you know we're doing adequate damage

00:28:55.999 --> 00:29:03.139
ourselves largely thanks to that awesome

00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:05.539
tears upgrade and we're not going to

00:29:03.139 --> 00:29:09.379
have anymore you know multi charge rooms

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:10.969
in all likelihood so helped up I'm

00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:12.649
thankful for it but it is largely

00:29:10.969 --> 00:29:15.259
irrelevant can I pay that forward to a

00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:18.009
future run that I'm potentially going to

00:29:15.259 --> 00:29:18.009
die on because

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.529
nice so we don't need to use this

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:26.409
anymore we should basically just use the

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:27.759
void whenever we are lower on HP

00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:32.529
whenever we like are lower than full

00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:34.480
line HP basically I'm a little tool you

00:29:32.529 --> 00:29:36.789
gotta suck it up right yeah as a speed

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.200
upgrade well worth it we do want to be

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:40.389
able to suck up krampus instead just

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.490
because it's the right decision you know

00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:43.809
you never know when something that even

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.210
if it seems minor might have like a

00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:49.419
pretty important impact so we might as

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:51.549
well give it a try but certainly if we

00:29:49.419 --> 00:29:59.080
get the chance to suck up a passive that

00:29:51.549 --> 00:30:00.340
stinks we'd rather do that because I

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.629
mean I don't know if you need me to tell

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.309
you this curse the tower is kind of

00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:05.649
garbage I'm the kind of guy who'll

00:30:03.309 --> 00:30:07.330
reroll my whole run you know on the

00:30:05.649 --> 00:30:08.679
chest even if it is a dailies at least

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.480
some of the time if the dailies already

00:30:08.679 --> 00:30:12.250
lost I'll throw the you know something

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.389
at the wall to see what sticks it's you

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:16.000
know why by the way there's like a

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:18.940
lasting legacy of this one daily that

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.220
came out soon after the release of

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.860
rebirth or I guess afterbirth cos

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.480
afterbirth that at the dailies right I

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:28.029
believe so

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:30.190
anyway there was a day leery where the

00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:33.009
lost it was post holy mantle so you

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.730
started with holy mantle but the right

00:30:33.009 --> 00:30:35.860
call

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.840
was to actually reroll statistically

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.399
speaking like you lost holy mantle of

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.750
course but you got an amazing damage

00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:42.669
upgrade or something like that and it

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.340
just like tied the whole run together

00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:49.450
and I lost as a result of my reticence

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:52.539
to re-roll which is that sounds like a

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:58.120
very erudite scooby-doo saying that my

00:30:52.539 --> 00:31:01.179
reticence to re-roll now which don't

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.679
winter of our discontent okay but you

00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:04.419
know make glorious some of other sons of

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:07.600
York we all got to say once is what is

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:10.240
dead may never die let's go um not not

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.070
11 life right now on in with respect to

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.830
you know the whole hey could we please

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.389
get to the hush fight in whatever sort

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.590
of stuff going on right here because I'm

00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:19.570
not sure if you're familiar with this

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:23.740
but we're running a little bit light on

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:25.629
time here this has to be our it's the

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.070
only way that can lead to something

00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:30.129
that's not a dead end

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:32.350
so it must be in this direction the only

00:31:30.129 --> 00:31:35.889
question is how long how

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:38.980
unless I sing this song how long how low

00:31:35.889 --> 00:31:45.179
whoa you know Sunday Bloody Sunday by

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:49.539
YouTube probably pretty popular song

00:31:45.179 --> 00:31:51.009
whatever old man okay let's let's go I

00:31:49.539 --> 00:31:53.409
think we're going to be able to make it

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:56.919
might be right we got to boss fights

00:31:53.409 --> 00:32:00.009
that's correct so I'm going to use my

00:31:56.919 --> 00:32:01.509
orbital light it I was going to say like

00:32:00.009 --> 00:32:02.710
it owes me money it's an expression that

00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:05.200
doesn't really make sense in this

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:06.940
context grab that line to back

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.899
uh sure got the stuff to make a booty go

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:13.990
smack we got it we got a this is like a

00:32:10.899 --> 00:32:15.429
million points on the line right here we

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:22.120
don't have an orbital a more bandage

00:32:15.429 --> 00:32:23.320
girl we've done it forget Krampus we

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.700
just want to make sure we get to the

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.960
hush fight we don't I don't care about

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.059
Krampus I said as much as I care about

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.860
getting to this hush fight and I think

00:32:28.059 --> 00:32:30.460
that the hush fight door might have

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.289
stayed open

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.210
but boss rush doesn't so you can forgive

00:32:32.289 --> 00:32:36.399
me a thing for making the well reasoned

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:38.230
choice here so I did make it I don't

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:39.669
even know if this is a bad decision to

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.740
be honest with you I think it might be a

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:46.659
completely okay decision to have red

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:48.309
chests on on the Blue Room we don't need

00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:49.570
to save keys but they rarely give you

00:32:48.309 --> 00:32:51.460
items anyway so we basically got

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.200
syndrome's out of a red chest you've got

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.840
to go soy milk even at the cost of your

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.399
own damage going way down being able to

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.620
spam shots like that makes it all worth

00:32:57.399 --> 00:33:01.090
it party clown is like straight-up

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.090
garbage

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:05.950
we can't take any of these so I think

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:08.409
you just I think you void both of these

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.759
we got a fairly good I mean the luck

00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:11.500
upgrades probably the best part but

00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:16.120
getting damage out of that is not

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:19.840
insignificant necessarily so I am I'm

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:22.750
extremely happy that we are by the way

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:27.009
get ready for this sound but I am

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:28.990
extremely happy that we are holding Book

00:33:27.009 --> 00:33:31.809
of Revelations inside a void right now

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:35.980
because it would be a flippin nightmare

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:38.440
man we're going to the void floor the

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.289
void floor is annoying we're going to

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.570
take a lot of damage probably delirium

00:33:41.289 --> 00:33:46.830
itself is going to be

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:48.480
a total pain in the butt there will be a

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:50.009
discussion I'm sure about whether or not

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.230
soy milk was the right decision here

00:33:50.009 --> 00:33:59.399
we've I mean if you factor it in a

00:33:52.230 --> 00:34:02.480
pretty sure we lowered our damage by 80%

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:05.340
you know we went from like 9:00 to 2:00

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.690
but our rate of fire went from 9:00 to

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:10.859
1:00

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:13.379
which is a nine-fold increase in our

00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:16.020
ability to output damage however I

00:34:13.379 --> 00:34:17.520
actually cannot tap the button fast

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.790
enough to take advantage of that like

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.339
the ideal would be to flex your

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:25.560
four-hour muscle as hard as you can and

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:28.649
believe me I have practice doing this

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.659
but it's it's uncomfortable and

00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:31.800
unsustainable it might even like what

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.599
I'm getting at it that the fact that our

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.970
rate of fire is 1 is not really that

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:37.349
relevant because if it was 3 we'd

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:39.780
probably be outputting the same amount

00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:41.760
so it is plausible that soymilk was the

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.960
wrong decision the other option was my

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.490
reflection which I don't think does

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.230
anything for us but we could avoid that

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:47.460
room and who knows what that might have

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:51.000
given us I think it would have been a

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.409
safer bet maybe but I don't think the

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.169
hush fight is the right time to really

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:57.839
judge that by the way I know why I want

00:34:55.169 --> 00:34:59.160
to have bandaged girl in there chewing

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:02.430
but I also don't want to get that close

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.319
to the enemies did I not take night

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:07.500
light like where where is my night light

00:35:04.319 --> 00:35:10.410
action here was waiting for their shots

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:16.380
to get slowed down am I losing my mind

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:18.120
or is bandage girl shooting what

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:26.310
vanna's girl get in there and do some

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:28.350
chewing oh that was so bad your job is

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:36.390
not to shoot bandage girl your job is to

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:39.240
chew well you are substantially less

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:42.300
useful you're actually like just a worse

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.460
version of the second level bandage girl

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.830
if you don't orbit me any longer but you

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.810
still you know don't chew on the enemy

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.540
it's like if I don't shoot you go in

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.880
there and deal some damage

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:57.210
no that's mad confusing dude I got no

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:59.430
idea what's up with that alright so

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:03.570
what's the game plan on the void floor

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:06.540
very very very simple we owe it to

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:08.670
ourselves to not fight delirium first we

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:15.960
got to try to get stronger before we go

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:18.620
through with the delirium fight recall

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:23.700
that damage upgrades are not going to be

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:25.200
all that useful tier effects are going

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.700
to take precedent but I mean if we see a

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.930
damage upgrade we probably take it even

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.290
though it's going to be like one tempest

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:34.080
as its magnitude will be 1/10 what it

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.840
normally would be you know you got to at

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.430
least just try and see if it was a black

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.390
heart you got to at least give me credit

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:44.670
I'm not going to go to that accidentally

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:46.920
okay so I don't need to look at the

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.360
scores I think that it's conceivable a

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.170
lot of people will make this but it

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:56.460
wasn't necessarily easy to make it to

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:58.080
the to the boss rush to make it to the

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.450
hush fight was a little easier although

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.260
it did get a little tight at the end

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:04.830
conceivable somebody could have gotten

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:10.170
mapping I did not get so more than

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:14.580
possible two extra spirit odds honestly

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:17.610
that's probably irrelevant but that's

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:21.799
okay you might want to leave spirit

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:30.169
hearts on the ground like

00:37:21.799 --> 00:37:34.709
it seems maybe needlessly my newts but I

00:37:30.169 --> 00:37:36.299
sort of disagree because we can generate

00:37:34.709 --> 00:37:37.880
our own spirit hearts and we're going to

00:37:36.299 --> 00:37:42.479
generate our own spirit odds as a

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:44.699
byproduct of using void to pick up items

00:37:42.479 --> 00:37:47.819
or to you know use mom's bra or whenever

00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:49.529
that we're going to do with them but so

00:37:47.819 --> 00:37:50.849
why would we bother picking up spirit

00:37:49.529 --> 00:37:52.859
arts that are on the ground those could

00:37:50.849 --> 00:37:54.569
be used whenever we want them they could

00:37:52.859 --> 00:37:56.369
be used dynamically instead of you know

00:37:54.569 --> 00:37:58.259
whenever we have a battery charge so I

00:37:56.369 --> 00:37:59.759
think those are more valuable the thing

00:37:58.259 --> 00:38:01.019
is we're just not using the charge we

00:37:59.759 --> 00:38:04.439
have right now which doesn't really help

00:38:01.019 --> 00:38:06.089
us out so you know might be a case I'm

00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:09.630
I'm doing the right thing for the wrong

00:38:06.089 --> 00:38:11.849
reasons or at the wrong time at least

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:14.189
pretty happy to be alive here okay so

00:38:11.849 --> 00:38:19.049
we'll void now because we can get the

00:38:14.189 --> 00:38:20.819
full HP this could be delirium so I

00:38:19.049 --> 00:38:22.259
think we just slow our roll I'm okay

00:38:20.819 --> 00:38:25.949
with today's daily being a little on the

00:38:22.259 --> 00:38:32.759
long side why not fight delirium right

00:38:25.949 --> 00:38:37.859
now well I don't trust myself to not die

00:38:32.759 --> 00:38:40.309
really we've got the voids we really

00:38:37.859 --> 00:38:43.049
might as well leverage our our

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:45.809
advantages any one of those could be

00:38:43.049 --> 00:38:47.219
delirium usually we'll find a tighter

00:38:45.809 --> 00:38:49.169
cluster a little later that'll make

00:38:47.219 --> 00:38:50.489
things easier on us so so it for magic

00:38:49.169 --> 00:38:52.109
mush here in a secret room

00:38:50.489 --> 00:38:56.009
you know secret room they'll magic much

00:38:52.109 --> 00:39:00.989
but relatively efficient bomb ranking

00:38:56.009 --> 00:39:02.549
wise I mean we're on the low side if if

00:39:00.989 --> 00:39:04.679
you only look at the what leads up to

00:39:02.549 --> 00:39:05.759
the boss rush we were on the low side we

00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:08.669
were probably looking at like you know

00:39:05.759 --> 00:39:10.049
top 500 maximum now of course we don't

00:39:08.669 --> 00:39:13.819
want that goes up yet not to be good

00:39:10.049 --> 00:39:16.079
anyway but now I think there's a

00:39:13.819 --> 00:39:19.019
conceivable case that we could be in the

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:20.579
top 250 at least they we pulled it

00:39:19.019 --> 00:39:22.849
together here and honestly I needed to

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:25.979
run like this get my confidence up

00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:28.349
yesterday's daily was fine in the end

00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:31.649
not great but fine but it wasn't what I

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:33.790
wanted you know I I messed up my plan on

00:39:31.649 --> 00:39:37.540
today's daily we executed the plan

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:39.460
properly probably not delirium I mean

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.190
any boss fight is probably not delirium

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:45.550
but it says the lowest chance of being

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:47.650
delirium Gabby's head you take you use I

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.420
think you just go for the suck on it I

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:53.020
don't expect it to be particularly

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:55.470
strong but it's fine and we got a got

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:58.420
the item so it's a start

00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.820
we got the left hand Guffey is not out

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.230
of the realm of possibility it's pretty

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.300
unlikely I can't believe we've had the

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.100
left hand for like three floors we've

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:09.280
gotten so many chests and then our first

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:11.650
guppy item was on a boss room on the

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.350
void you know whoever had that money in

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:16.390
the in the prop bets wherever at that

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.920
proposition in the prop bets is making a

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.390
lot of money I should say it's like

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.860
betting on the Senators to make it to

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.380
the conference finals if you know what I

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:28.600
mean

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:30.550
now just continue going here it's like

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:37.650
12 mega fatties it's not my favorite

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:37.650
room one has died

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:52.190
please they can make that jump I think

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:58.730
so gotta be careful we're done we're

00:40:52.190 --> 00:41:00.490
done I'm going to use it I think we

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:03.560
should be using it whenever possible

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:04.910
battery charges aw that was so bad I saw

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.250
it coming I just couldn't get out of the

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:11.510
way fast enough I initiated the dodge

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:12.650
protocol slightly late we got spirit

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.420
eyes from the ground that we want to

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:18.100
make sure that we avoid ready for like

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.100
sucking up items we don't want but I

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:23.300
think we can we can afford to use it the

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.740
thing is we're never going to get a deal

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:28.940
with the devil so if we see an item that

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:32.120
we want to suck up but we don't have a

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:35.330
charge we can just wait like we lose

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:37.010
nothing I walked into the enemy because

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.290
I didn't do enough damage quickly to

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:42.500
kill a single spider that's not even a

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:44.630
bad sign that's just a needless damage

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.220
at this point in our lives lockdown I

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:52.640
mean I'm never going to use something's

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:55.640
wrong for productive purposes but might

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.290
might I ask what blew that up how did my

00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:02.750
tear blow this up there must have been

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:04.520
one barrel in there that wasn't or one

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:06.380
barrel that we could shoot there many

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.700
barrels in there is my brain broken I

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:13.730
think my brain might be broken on this

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:14.960
one that's okay dude not saying every

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.330
single one of these should give us a

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:21.980
spirit oh that's unrealistic I am

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:24.820
suggesting some more of them should give

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.820
us spirit hearts

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:34.240
we've only fought one boss so far it's a

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.490
bit of a light floor

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.109
there must be here's like seven bosses

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:40.540
on the Delirium floor somewhere in that

00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:46.210
range so honestly there should be like a

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:47.440
cluster of bosses over here which is

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:50.290
great because if they're clustered

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.119
together makes it less likely I'm just

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:54.099
going to save my charge for now because

00:42:52.119 --> 00:42:55.960
effectively we are at full HP you know

00:42:54.099 --> 00:43:00.280
having this charge stored up as an asset

00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:02.349
so now we're not at full HP and we're

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.119
kind of wasting time but I'd like to

00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:05.619
make sure we have a charge to suck up

00:43:04.119 --> 00:43:06.760
whatever our next item could be anyway I

00:43:05.619 --> 00:43:08.800
mean we should probably should have

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:12.470
sucked up Steam sale now that I think

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:14.580
about it that was a bit of a whisk there

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:16.840
[Music]

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.970
if I shouldn't be surprised that this

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:23.230
super-secret last floor of the game is

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:30.250
long but like it's really long dude this

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:34.210
could be delirium kind of misusing void

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:37.599
at this point but I really really do not

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:43.240
want to fight delirium first or second

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:45.670
or now wherever maybe I mean I know we

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.770
don't have to but I feel the I feel the

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:53.470
pull to do so anyway this will not be

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:54.700
delirium in all likelihood the bloat I

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.349
don't even wait to see if it was

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.180
delirium that's how confident I was in

00:43:56.349 --> 00:44:00.990
my in my assessment of the situation

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:04.300
don't ever fire on me thank you

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:06.820
roasted the bloat pretty quickly suck

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:11.619
that up we get luck and honestly the

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:13.810
speed is so valuable we're almost out of

00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:15.190
El please give me a battery charge no

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.960
batteries charge all right please give

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:19.960
me good items then because we are out of

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:22.230
charges it's not like we need one for

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:25.030
our boss fight anyway this is the gates

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:26.680
I'm happy with the speed upgrade it

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.180
might even be more valuable than damage

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:33.190
at this point makes it a lot easier for

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:35.700
me to dodge things give a sad bombs it's

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:38.589
a lovely get thank you very much

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.340
we have soy milk so I don't expect sad

00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:42.970
bombs to real

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:50.230
crush it but nice nonetheless five extra

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:52.030
bombs uh now it matters don't question

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.670
it just say thank you and move on I

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:55.950
don't know how we didn't get hit there

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:58.480
now I don't think it really matters

00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:01.750
whether we fight delirium first or the

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:04.570
second or twentieth so we're going to go

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:06.520
up and we've already we haven't done the

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:08.440
top one this has a good chance to be

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.210
delirium I'd say kind of by his lonesome

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.040
daddy-longlegs which is really nice

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:14.380
although daddy-longlegs Plus try acting

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:16.090
on the same floor is a little you know a

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.000
lot of this daddy-longlegs damage is

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:21.220
somewhat improv n table so can be a

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.330
little dicey but we made it happen ten

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:31.330
extra bombs at this point it's points

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:33.130
plus maybe bombs are good with sad bombs

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:36.430
but I don't think I mean we can just see

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:40.900
for a second here don't think it's going

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:42.220
to be great I'm really glad that I mean

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.560
if we're going to focus on the positives

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:46.960
exclusively here mistakes are well known

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.520
on this run but we we tried I think we

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.950
did a pretty good job - ready we already

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.360
checked that I'm sure and I think our

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.650
score is going to bear that out I don't

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.070
think today's score is going to be bad

00:45:53.650 --> 00:46:01.600
but I'm really glad that we chose not to

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:02.590
go for one of these bosses right off the

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.180
bat I mean we'd probably would have

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:06.460
thought monstera through first but yeah

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:10.300
that Delirium fight could have been a

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:12.130
real problem goat head is not even worth

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.990
taking at this point but there's no

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:16.120
battery charges that I can see they're

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:21.180
just looking for like an empress card or

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:24.130
something take us to the next level if

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:26.230
not though where we're moving out we're

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:29.040
moving on and it's the Delirium fight

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:33.250
this is where you alt f4 if you want to

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.840
be a freakin trihard baby but we're not

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:38.550
going to do that we're going to fight

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:45.310
the lyrium gonna take a long time

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:52.270
that's okay not all of these deliriums

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:53.859
created equal some of them are wouldn't

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.180
say impossible but pretty difficult to

00:46:53.859 --> 00:46:56.980
dodge some of them are very easy to

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.570
dodge and same thing applies for dealing

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.520
damage like now that we actually have

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:02.619
functional speed give me more of this

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.450
mom foot like we can stay far enough

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:08.320
away we are extremely lucky by the way

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:10.290
we have infinite range so it really

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.369
nullifies like one of the principal

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:14.080
difficulties and fighting delirium is

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:15.520
hey I never want to get close to this

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.440
guy because he fired shots extremely

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:20.109
unpredictably but I can't get that far

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.240
away or I'm never going to hit so we're

00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:24.099
pretty lucky that we're we're able to

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.080
hit from afar we're going to take damage

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:27.130
if you've already taken damage but we're

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:31.300
going to take more damage over the

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:32.730
course of today's daily or today's Void

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:36.670
fight delirium fight

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:38.050
it's unpreventable see like in that

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.880
situation we were kind of darned if we

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:43.000
do darned if we don't but I think we can

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.680
leave today's daily a little proud you

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.080
know they say pride is the same tonight

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.640
can understand why we ever watched us

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.190
played player on knowns battlegrounds

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:55.900
pride is the downfall of many of our

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:59.890
runs I'd say but pride also means you

00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:00.550
know you work for something and you

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.920
succeeded

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:05.890
uess maybe sacrifice not that you know

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:08.080
I'm not gonna make it sound like I've

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:11.349
given up a lot to be on today's daily

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.869
but I think we can be proud of our

00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:17.619
performance today okay that that hurts

00:48:13.869 --> 00:48:19.660
me we're at more than half of our HP and

00:48:17.619 --> 00:48:21.369
we've taken out more than half of

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.990
greed-based we're at half of our HP and

00:48:21.369 --> 00:48:24.640
we've taken out more than half of and I

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:29.830
said greed but I mean delirium of course

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:34.530
deliriums HP so good we're on pace at

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:34.530
least I'd rather be more on pace

00:48:34.759 --> 00:48:43.079
there's a card down there the judgment

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:50.999
cards worth exploding but not worth

00:48:43.079 --> 00:48:53.359
distracting yourself probably perfect

00:48:50.999 --> 00:48:53.359
perfect perfect

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:06.770
I always get rattled by the explosive

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:10.430
shots man now remember I think you only

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:12.230
get the point ball hisses getting a

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:18.890
little close but you only get the point

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:22.550
bonus if you don't die I mean of course

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:24.020
even if he died I mean is will somewhere

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:28.460
so he can just lay back and chill

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:30.020
somewhere but gone on record you know

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:34.880
I'm not the biggest fan of the Delirium

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:37.850
fighting because no matter what you're

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:41.630
destined to get screwed on it by telefax

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:43.400
but I don't know how we didn't get it

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:45.320
there of what that like thank you

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:50.570
okay we're probably going to die I still

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:51.230
think today's daily is a success I can

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.750
live with myself

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:58.610
76 absolutely fine we did it our way

00:49:53.750 --> 00:50:00.800
became 76 I'm proud of it please make it

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:02.450
so you get a point bonus for fighting

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.620
delirious oh there's some incentive for

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.550
