00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.389
everybody was making it on the lane

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.080
plays the binding of issac a truthful I

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.450
swear I am NOT going to do a rerun run

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.410
this time because I need a break let's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.049
see what we got here

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:19.220
zero zgz gp2x we got the negative black

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.310
feather and void horrible rate of fire

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.170
horrible damage but a great space bar

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.570
item and what you wouldn't ok sure it's

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.700
going to be one of those I've sucked up

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.530
the D infinity the D infinity is my

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.500
voided item of choice once every six

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.879
rooms or rather whenever we choose to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.789
use the infinity we are going to re-roll

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190
our whole run we roll all consumables on

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.969
the ground we roll our stats re-roll the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.710
enemies reroll an existing item pedestal

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.800
or you know just for kicks sometimes

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.449
will reroll everything depending on what

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.160
we got okay you know what get the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.760
freaking Twitter closed yeah I don't

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.500
care

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.060
Twitter I like to have any up in the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.710
background just because I've usually got

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.420
a Twitter tab open in the backer I'm not

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.950
checking on it while I play the episodes

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.060
just have it don't die here early that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.340
would be embarrassing even though our

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
stats are terrible but now Twitter's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.850
always like hey you want to know what's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.170
going on on Bloomberg News I don't care

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.080
do I strike you as the kind of person

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.060
who invests in the sp500 if you said no

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.159
well you know shame on you looks can be

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
deceiving it's important you know make

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.610
your money work for you put it in an

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.720
index fund earning an average of 7%

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.579
annually you know adds up over time at

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.259
the same time I did part of that two

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.420
hands off the situation means that is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.020
don't give a crap about what's happening

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.810
you know Tesla's made a billion dollars

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.520
said good okay I always thought that guy

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.790
was unappreciated in life even though he

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.549
died like 95 years before I was but I

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.619
don't know when Nikola Tesla tied the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.630
point is that I would start broadcasting

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.899
NHL playoff games through that little

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:12.180
box on the Twitter page and I'm okay but

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:14.170
nothing else Bloomberg News I don't care

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.510
unless you run ads in front of these

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.300
videos in which case great work crack

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.700
team of journalists over there just

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.620
about the last reputable source for

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.340
financial news in this crazy mixed-up

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.660
world anyway how is today's daily well I

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.790
mean it's tough to say because this is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.130
not a daily house today's run it's

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:42.640
horrible cool this is like actually

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:47.440
awful but here's my my major incentive

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:52.990
not to die is because void the Infinity

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.420
is not necessarily good it's too much

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.600
uncertainty but that's what makes it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.060
kind of enjoyable and that maybe even

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.700
more so than kind of enjoyable keep in

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.130
mind I could void an item but reroll it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.140
well I void or alternatively reroll

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.460
every other item I have on the run well

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.590
I void it which I don't even know what

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.550
the implications of that are so I'm

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.650
liking the optics on this run is God

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.660
Zane written all over it certainly this

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.459
is not a run that I would expect to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.709
pivot into a into a rerun anytime soon

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.020
and the main reason for that is holy

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.209
hell if you notice that we have roughly

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.090
half of our usual rate of fire and then

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.330
also below average damage making this

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.630
probably like a once a month bad start

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.180
as far as DPS goes but still to HP means

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.310
that it's not implausible to make it out

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.709
of this and we did get a great starting

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.180
item as far as active items go even

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.000
though our trinket is presently useless

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.590
and the negative is just I mean at the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.590
best of times that item is barely

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.130
noticeable so I'm not trying to make it

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.870
sound like we're screwed here because in

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.690
all honesty I'd rather be in this

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.610
situation than have average damage and

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.320
like substantially below average speed

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.850
with the same amount of HP in which case

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.810
we might already be dead by this point

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.190
but there is an out for this run but

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.390
it's going to be unlikely like we're

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.090
going to be one of those people you see

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.470
on the news where maybe some of you are

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.289
watching this video where you're going

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.490
to be like you know I shouldn't even be

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.010
alive but look at what I've done for

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.450
myself

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.040
my life it's an amazing thing that's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.620
where we are right now not to make light

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.050
of the you know situation I think we

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.430
should I think we should do it we deport

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.620
ourselves and sucked up nothing so yeah

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.050
we should not have done that case that's

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.770
not abundantly clear sweet okay one more

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.110
floor that day skirts the blinds thanks

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.640
me for being an idiot but also Thank You

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:57.710
curse of the blind for enabling my

00:04:49.640 --> 00:05:00.830
idiocy you know I think with 1.06 speed

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.950
we can just roll it yeah okay all right

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.140
so what's the plan well honestly I'm

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.780
fairly unconcerned de bout a deal with

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.420
the devil I'm very much concerned with

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.590
survival and somewhat skeptical that

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.590
we're going to be able to hit that goal

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.600
on this floor if we've missed a deal

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.540
with the devil but Liv I'll be a happy

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.590
camper the heck of a shot speed on this

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.260
guy I will say we started with above

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.290
zero luck not much above zero but above

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.760
zero luck so it's not implausible that

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.510
we at least get enough red hearts to

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.670
live someone's going to explode soon and

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.520
it's going to change the dynamic on this

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.650
room by the way did you know do you want

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.950
an indication for how I feel about

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.050
today's run boss rush is probably out of

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.930
the question for us and we're on the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:55.130
second floor so that's a good trying to

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.420
think of the word that I'm looking at a

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.640
good emblem it's emblematic of why I

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.360
don't like today's run at the present

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:13.070
moment however it is a huge step for us

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:15.410
I shot at him as many times as I could

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:22.190
shoot at him before he hit me what can I

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:23.690
do but there is still a way out you're

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.930
not gonna love this strategy I'll tell

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.900
you that right now but as long as we're

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.310
going through heck you know it's like

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.660
Winston Churchill said if you're going

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.980
through heck keep going you might have

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.080
used some more colorful language there I

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.140
don't know you go the skinny room or do

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.380
you go big room

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:46.220
I win skinny room but there's some

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:50.690
skinny room variants that are not

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.340
beloved by me right now especially

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.760
considering you know if we get hit once

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.760
we die

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:03.350
dude that was horrible

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:08.440
let's restart okay well it's the right

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:14.840
time to have a loss jpc w2 f 0h we got I

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:17.120
forget pasal and flush great damage

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.650
great rate of fire actually I'm not just

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.840
saying that to draw a contrast with the

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.640
last run I wish I'd lived on the last

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.740
run and the damage that I took at the

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.090
end was indisputably something that we

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:31.120
could have done better about preventing

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:33.110
but I really I dodged and then he shot I

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.580
should have waited for him to shoot and

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.200
then dodge but I mean you don't need to

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.450
you don't need to explain to me how to

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.620
dodge those attacks I've dodged like 500

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.660
of them and my Isaac career just

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:47.780
unfortunately chose the wrong moment to

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:49.220
miss that one we have no desire right

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.810
now to take thunder thighs unless we get

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.920
a huge speed upgrade somewhere else on

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:59.330
this floor I think that 0.86 speed is is

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:01.070
the problem hilariously my my run has

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.210
sort of given me exactly what I asked

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.790
for and like a be careful what you wish

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:07.100
for sort of situation I said I would

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.590
much rather have the last run than have

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.990
above-average damage but severely below

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.480
average speed however I would argue that

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:18.110
0.86 speed is not severely below average

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.070
it's like one one standard deviation

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.950
below the norm

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.540
it's almost unnoticeable unless you find

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.180
yourself in some rooms that are already

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:29.240
fairly tough because the enemies are

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:32.840
speeding but our damage is actually like

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.940
really good they have damage over four

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.750
and a rate of fire that's above or sorry

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:41.510
below I guess 10 is indicative of like

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:44.480
we're beating the we're beating the

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.890
average at both ends here you know we

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.180
got more questions right and we got

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.410
harder questions right that were worth

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.900
more points that's not a very good

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.610
school analogy but the school analogies

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.820
they're good because we all have

00:08:52.610 --> 00:09:02.350
some familiarity with it you know I

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:06.080
so the III make similes and idioms a lot

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.670
it's a very niche skill but it does help

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.790
me communicate in a way that I think is

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.720
more universally relatable bad idiom is

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.310
like you know let's look when you're

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.380
playing lawn bowling you see you've

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.150
already cut out like 98% of your

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.530
audience there doesn't have a

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.420
familiarity with lawn bowling

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.740
of course aristocrats like you and me

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.380
we've got a great affinity for lawn

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.120
bowling we know it's a gentleman's game

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.770
height of athleticism balance and form

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.020
but on the other hand not everybody

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:34.850
shares our taste in sports

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:38.500
now again Plan C is just an item that

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.500
might as well not exist in my opinion

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:47.930
the use for it is so niche that it never

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:51.760
really factors into our our game plans

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:54.200
here one day maybe I believe you know a

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.880
million monkeys working on a million

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.430
typewriters would eventually make

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.220
William Shakespeare's plays right one

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:04.120
day Plan C is going to be one of those

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:10.190
monkeys is going to be the chosen monkey

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:12.590
spider but is okay nod leaf is great so

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.490
now I mean not leave as a compromise and

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:19.430
the compromise here is very simply this

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:21.920
if we get any orbital not leaf is really

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.380
really good now we owe it to ourselves

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.840
not to die by the way in case that's not

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.510
obvious like on every single run but if

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.340
we die on this run after getting what we

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.070
asked for on the last run we're in a

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.900
rough spot now that spirit heart resists

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.610
the notion to suggest that that spirit

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.440
heart has carried us because we haven't

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.090
taken read our damage we haven't even

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.460
really come too close to taking read

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.620
heart damage but I will say that I would

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.930
be lying if I wasn't thankful for that

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.990
spirit heart but I'm thankful for every

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.310
spirit heart baby and why throw a baby

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.390
in at the end there and made it sound

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.190
weird it's one of those words that

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.400
doesn't sound right coming out of my

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.400
mouth

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.839
I don't know I'm trying to think of some

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.439
other ones I don't get bothered by a lot

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:07.579
of words they're just words to me some

00:11:06.439 --> 00:11:09.709
people are bothered by the word moist

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:12.350
doesn't bother me at all I sort of

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:15.439
understand it it's kind of like it's got

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:18.139
weird you know implications and then

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:19.879
also it has like a little bit of a snake

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:24.649
kiss at the end of the the end of the

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:28.009
word doesn't really bother me what

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:30.620
bothers me is hearing a grown man say

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:32.540
well that's not true hearing a man in

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.309
his 20s say honey that sends shivers

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:38.629
down my spine and not in a good way

00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:40.309
ladies so someone like a 50 year old man

00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:41.749
says honey you're like yeah you know

00:11:40.309 --> 00:11:43.970
you've earned it you guys have been in a

00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:45.649
partnership for a while perhaps you're

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:49.879
like a 20 year old guys say honey you're

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:51.499
like six years ago you were 14 you can't

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:53.209
say honey yet you haven't earned it I

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:54.860
don't know what other words you should

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:58.899
be using I'm really I'm levying and

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:01.579
unfair criticism at you right now but

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:07.429
I'm just saying that's that's an earned

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:10.759
word so that worked somehow and you know

00:12:07.429 --> 00:12:13.540
we're a little bit out of sync when we

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:16.339
almost take damage against blighted ovum

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.509
boss is very very simple to deal with

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:19.550
but here's where we're going to start

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:21.860
falling out of control what did I tell

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:23.540
you black powder absolutely worthless

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.129
for us in our current situation let's

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.449
head down to the next floor great item

00:12:25.129 --> 00:12:32.600
we need some speed to deal with it

00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:36.709
though nah it's not good enough so what

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.720
is uh what's our primary course of

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:40.309
action on this right now our what we

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.920
actually desire on this run is a cube of

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:45.589
meat so if we can get like a library

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.089
book of revelations force that keep of

00:12:45.589 --> 00:12:48.769
meat into existence I don't really need

00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:51.709
to get rid of flesh I think it's like

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:54.709
basically the Necronomicon and it nukes

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:58.699
down some bosses in one hit but really

00:12:54.709 --> 00:13:01.519
like as a pretty niche concern nice if

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:06.139
we can get it but unlikely to be of

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:07.879
principal importance its abate Abel here

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:09.870
if we get a bomb back yes then it's not

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:11.530
debatable perfect

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.480
[Music]

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.580
keep moving

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.950
obviously Cuba meat is probably the most

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.510
likely orbital but there's other ones

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.520
that can show up on item rooms of

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.080
varying degrees of usefulness sac dagger

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.970
can also show up on deals with the devil

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.470
which would be good or obviously deals

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:30.110
with the angel we can get guardian angel

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.840
but can't really do anything for us get

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.930
a range upgrade from anemic an item that

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:40.340
is largely pretty awful in my opinion

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:41.840
and a battery charge most of the time I

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.760
wouldn't say a battery charge is like a

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.130
no-brainer not battery charged it's

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.840
literally the battery most the time it's

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.120
a no-brainer if you have a space bar

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.100
item that has some worth to it but we're

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.740
pretty much going to use flush whenever

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.380
it's available unless the room is so

00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:03.080
easy that flush has no purpose even like

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:06.290
existing on it you notice you know

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.660
you've got a to that own self be true so

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:11.710
we're using black powder we're using it

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:16.430
to make the actual world smallest

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:20.510
circles but hey when it works say works

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:23.090
man some of these enemies are still

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.710
terrestrial somehow that room made me

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:30.020
look like a genius I assure you that was

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:32.510
not intentional kind of wondering

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.580
actually why I'm seeming to struggle a

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.560
little bit right now because our stats

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.620
are actually except for speed our stats

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:43.310
are pretty good you know five damage

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:45.470
with a nine rate of fire should not be

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.770
leaving me feeling this bereft of you

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:50.510
know ability to kill the enemy but

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.860
suppose that is still somewhat modest in

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.560
the whole scheme of things you know five

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.900
damages a lot for the first floor but

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.980
pretty quickly can get outpaced by some

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.570
of the enemies that you face especially

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.760
if you find it so tough to dodge because

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:04.190
of I don't know your brain not working

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.480
right or speed being a little bit on the

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:09.680
lower end of the average today at least

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.270
which is I think probably the most

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.980
honest way to describe our speed stat

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:18.410
right now it's not the horrible just on

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:23.100
the low end of a verge so this is not my

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:28.310
ideal phosphide right now

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.310
but monstro should eat it pretty quickly

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:38.460
if we can get monster to land on

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:40.080
black-powder he will probably die of

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:44.010
course as soon as he landed on it it

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.810
disappeared but this should do it okay

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.550
now we can fight fistula and fighting

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:53.370
fistula on a big room is not really a

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:55.380
problem also going to try to least throw

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:59.130
down the occasional black powder circle

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.660
because we know that once fistula pops

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:04.470
into its terminal form it's going to

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.720
have silkworms so so Gorm's are going to

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:10.100
be tough for us to deal with with

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:12.930
relatively modest damage right now so

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:16.860
not quite fast enough to make this

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:18.300
circle work really felt to me like I

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.460
should say not quite fast enough to make

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:25.010
this circle work and that means that I

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.010
have found a word I found my moist

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:32.790
because were chol I don't respect that

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:38.940
as a word that's to Ned Flanders for me

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:41.700
it's to dokely honestly relatively good

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.740
bossfight greatly reduced rate of fire

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.430
and we got one spirit art out of it it's

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:49.050
not a game breaker but it's pretty good

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.790
like five damage I'm four point nine

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.010
seven but you know what I mean five

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.850
damage with the ability to go okay that

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:57.210
was pretty bad

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:59.460
basically shoot 50% faster is uh it's

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:02.040
really really good it's worth it for

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:05.850
sure so let's get flush ready and then

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:10.910
it's probably a secret room get flush

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:10.910
ready and then go to that boss trap room

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:19.440
the big item for us right now is nine

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:21.060
lives obviously the actual big item is

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.940
moms knife brimstone you know tech X

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.650
epic fetus there's a couple items that

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.360
mean more but nine lives is the best

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.640
because it gives us a huge safety net

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.860
and actually doesn't change our HP at

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.070
all so nine lives has effectively no

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.960
cost right now and like no cost great

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.230
benefit is a pretty good value in my

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.230
world

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.090
Harlequin baby is not worth too much

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.820
I recognize the the direness of the

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.920
situation now that we've lost even more

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.420
HP and this this HP is my bad I stepped

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.660
on creep I had no business getting hit

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.310
by so instead of going to the boss Trap

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.910
room we're flush now that I think about

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:04.340
it is fairly unlikely to be worthwhile I

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:04.340
mean there is a there's a chance that

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.810
help there is a chance that this boss

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.920
fight is the right course of action

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.830
let's give it a shot

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.660
Bighorn probably not the right course of

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.570
action given the prodigious amount of

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.100
bombs that are going to be created here

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:23.460
and I don't think Flush is going to do

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.050
too much for us and our speed makes it

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.240
pretty tough to dodge bombs to begin

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.820
with okay I didn't even see the hole

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.540
open up there hah hah hah hah hah hah

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.940
hah

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:40.140
but still of course if I can get black

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:43.020
powder to work I'd be stoked in an

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.760
extremely rare twist of fate I might not

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.890
even want to go to the deal with the

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:52.260
devil if we get one because there is a

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:54.990
chance that it's Krampus and if it's

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.600
Krampus we could be in a pretty tough

00:18:54.990 --> 00:19:00.450
spot we didn't get a deal with the devil

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.100
and we got spirit arts plus rate of fire

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.720
increase to the tear cap so I think

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.700
really we got lucky there but we did

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.380
play well against Bighorn as well we got

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.060
pretty lucky Bighorn didn't drop any

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:14.490
troll bombs if he had done that we would

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:16.560
be in a world of trouble instead though

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.080
we seem to be holding it together

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.060
relatively well I will say for all of

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.230
our HP related problems on this run I'm

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.480
really glad we didn't take thunder

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:27.309
thighs

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:30.909
she would have been an even worse

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:34.419
situation and I mean a dime from a fire

00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:38.110
is great but King baby is largely

00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:43.750
irrelevant as far as items go if we're

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:46.600
gonna do the boss trap for a golden

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:48.940
chest I have to think a little harder

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.370
about that I think because one golden

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.260
chest is not worth that much perhaps

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.149
more importantly one golden chest is

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.769
worth like exactly as much as another

00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:58.960
golden chest so if we can find the

00:19:56.769 --> 00:20:02.409
golden chest that we don't have to fight

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:07.330
a bunch of bosses to deal with it's much

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:10.769
better for us so there's two plays for

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:13.840
the Hermit card here one of them is to

00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:16.659
save a key and also get you out of the

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.039
boss trap room in two floors the other

00:20:16.659 --> 00:20:19.659
one is to use it right now and save you

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:21.100
half a spear at art we're going to do

00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:25.899
the one that saves us half a spear at

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:28.899
heart because the HP is slightly

00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:31.870
concerning right now I think we're going

00:20:28.899 --> 00:20:35.549
to leave and it's really because I'm a

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:38.740
baby but it's also because HP is at a

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:40.870
premium right now at least for now and

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.450
that's a great use of that thankfully

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.610
algae's a was Yara here is great

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:48.130
obviously but a waz gets us out of boss

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.360
rush which is probably more relevant to

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.000
me right now what a waste of the pacano

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.059
rune on my part if you're going to take

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.340
a waz you might as well double up and

00:20:54.059 --> 00:21:01.000
then take algae's and then take algae's

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.950
into the boss Tramp room back here and

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.659
then use one a watts to try to find like

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.850
a black market or a crawlspace and then

00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:08.380
take the next a waz down in fact you can

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:13.149
also use a nalgas to just open that

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:16.929
which we probably will so maybe we just

00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:19.500
got money but we got money at a cost of

00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:19.500
nothing

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:27.660
keep in mind our next boss is going to

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:31.880
be mega fatty which is why I'm not

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.880
investing in this algae's room right now

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:39.480
he's going to die very quickly so kill

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.049
him well this black powder circles still

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.590
around

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:46.710
oh it's actually shoved my bed either

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.100
way like six of one half a dozen of the

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:53.100
other

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:55.200
for our purposes right now it's pretty

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.419
smart play actually if I may say so

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.360
myself

00:21:56.419 --> 00:22:04.350
do we care about boss rush yes

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:06.270
yeah I mean we do is the thing so even

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:09.299
with 0.86 speed

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.669
I do feel a desire well you first pop

00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:13.410
that see what you get okay that's just a

00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:15.540
ticket down in the next floor then you

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.760
take the algae's rune we are doing this

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:26.100
to steal a free item out of the boss

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:28.309
rush so if we don't get the boss rush

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:31.710
it's a little bit of a whiff on our part

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:34.679
spend about 45 seconds here to get able

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:36.120
it's a bad play unless you you know can

00:22:34.679 --> 00:22:38.070
divorce yourself from the idea that boss

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.870
rush matters and I'm probably guilty of

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:44.040
overvaluing boss rush a lot so I

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:45.419
recognize that maybe I'm either way

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.370
Able's not going to be that good okay

00:22:45.419 --> 00:22:50.309
you can't Jedi mind trick me into

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:54.000
thinking that I'm now like apologetic

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:56.700
too able however did it really cost us

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.190
anything probably not so I had to take

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.020
the fish tail on which up until recently

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:04.320
someone tweeted me and then they're like

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.429
hey have you ever had fish tail like if

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.049
you unlocked it I don't think I've ever

00:23:05.429 --> 00:23:09.000
seen it on one of your runs and then I

00:23:07.049 --> 00:23:11.910
thought about and I was like fish tail I

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.740
never heard of an item or a trinket like

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.669
that rather and then I looked it up on

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:20.070
the wiki and I was like oh you're

00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:22.169
talking about the weird glod guard which

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:24.090
is obviously my own ignorance and not

00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:27.750
theirs but apparently what this does is

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:30.390
it doubles the amount of flies or

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:34.299
spiders while n spiders I guess rather

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:37.169
that you get when you generate spiders

00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:39.669
so to have this with like a guppy

00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:41.769
related items such as Guppies head or

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:42.909
just the transformation or the Mulligan

00:23:41.769 --> 00:23:44.320
or mom's wig

00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:50.080
you know sissy long legs you get the

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:52.479
idea can allow us to compensate for not

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.799
really crushing it in the damaged

00:23:52.479 --> 00:23:56.739
Department right now although I can't

00:23:53.799 --> 00:24:00.190
complain too hard still waiting on that

00:23:56.739 --> 00:24:02.619
one orbital because oh you mean it's

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:05.529
that's unfortunate you got to think

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:07.359
about it here because I mean fishtail as

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:08.739
soon as I actually read the description

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:11.679
of the trinket instead of just trying to

00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:13.779
rely on figuring it out in the you know

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:15.969
real world environment I was like that

00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:17.769
drink it's great I just didn't want to

00:24:15.969 --> 00:24:20.349
deal with the time on this room no greed

00:24:17.769 --> 00:24:21.849
no greed it's greed why no greed because

00:24:20.349 --> 00:24:23.999
I wanted to buy a key and then also have

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:27.039
a chance to buy something in here but

00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:31.119
whatever Steam sale is not great for us

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:34.119
but life goes on but we need the extra

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:37.419
speed right now 0.15 speed is actually

00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:41.289
like relative to 0.86 speed is something

00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:43.359
like a 20% increase so even something is

00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:45.820
relatively modest as that is pretty

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:49.389
important when you're low on speed to

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:51.999
begin with so got a 100% deal to devil

00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:54.669
champs 9lives is still kind of the dream

00:24:51.999 --> 00:24:57.309
but I think we have enough spirit heart

00:24:54.669 --> 00:25:00.519
protection right now to be like you know

00:24:57.309 --> 00:25:02.709
what if you want to give me something

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:08.919
high damage I can roll with it for a

00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:11.589
while I can make it work it is I mean we

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:14.009
got to try to go to the item room but it

00:25:11.589 --> 00:25:17.820
is going to set us back

00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:20.829
not to mention like black powder is

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.239
probably sadly our best chance of

00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:27.999
dealing a lot of damage to enemies

00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:31.059
quickly so I do think that it's a good

00:25:27.999 --> 00:25:32.919
case to be made that the gotough sadly

00:25:31.059 --> 00:25:36.999
despite the fact that it's a somewhat

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:40.589
boring trinket is also simultaneously

00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:40.589
the exact right call

00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:48.870
okay good work good work 100% no Krampus

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:52.020
no Krampus cake growth hormones is great

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:58.410
no Krampus that's right let's go

00:25:52.020 --> 00:26:01.620
Abaddon's big money now we've got eight

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:03.990
damage five rate of fire and very good

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.910
speed so you know what I thought that

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:14.940
didn't work I think we can afford to

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:15.990
take the fish tail when we find it's

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.460
been teleported to a room that's

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:23.100
actually closer to where we want to go

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:24.929
now so that's fine and I'm banking on

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.200
the idea that was horrible obviously but

00:26:24.929 --> 00:26:33.030
I'm banking on the idea that I can also

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.919
still make it to boss rush here and

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.659
that's going to be a bit of an asking

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:40.650
pokeballs not going to help us too much

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:42.990
on route for that so I feel like we

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:45.000
whipped a little bit please no curse of

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:48.929
the maze shenanigans just let me take

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.850
the fish tail in my defense this looks

00:26:48.929 --> 00:26:53.700
much less like a fish tail than it does

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:56.580
like a weird dart that you know Tommy

00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:00.390
Davidson would shoot into Jim Carrey's

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.890
neck during the part in a Sven charity

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:04.650
when nature calls when he's in that

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:08.850
tribe and the pipes him and he gets

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:10.530
called the white devil remember is that

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.360
I mean it's not current reference but

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.159
it's a movie that I feel like has a

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.640
place in the public consciousness I

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:23.840
wouldn't be surprised it wasn't like a

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:26.520
an exclusive reference with one key I'm

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:31.110
basically going to go I mean I probably

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.549
should use in my defense I thought with

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:37.260
eight damage they be dust and pretty

00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:40.440
quick but we'll use our key basically

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:46.660
whatever important room comes first you

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:49.460
got a look but okay go go up here

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.650
two keys for those bombs yeah in another

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.050
world maybe where we had keys oh you

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:59.570
guys were immune during that okay so a

00:27:54.050 --> 00:28:00.920
bit of a whiff we're getting tilted

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:05.809
everything tilted for a bad reason

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:07.880
there's no reason to we got two keys now

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:10.340
check it check it check it you got to

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:16.790
try it I think got to grab this forget

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:18.050
broken stopwatch I'm proud I was gonna

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.330
say there's no there's no reason to take

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.470
damage against like easy enemies even

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:25.280
when you're trying to go fast because

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:28.550
you're the odds of you getting an item

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.580
on boss rush that compensates for the

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:36.790
bad damage you've taken is fairly low

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:38.870
now we did go to the last item room I'm

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:41.990
not going to go to this item room

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:44.240
because I think getting what our choice

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:46.929
of four items from boss rush is more

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.880
valuable than going back and maybe

00:28:46.929 --> 00:28:51.140
getting one item and I mean I shouldn't

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.670
say maybe because the only uncertainty

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.429
in the situation is whether or not we'll

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.960
still make it to the boss rush right

00:28:55.429 --> 00:29:00.640
isn't like that's what's actually in

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.640
question here that was bad

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:13.799
it could be Krampus I got a check not

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:16.350
Krampus not good but not Krampus alright

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:18.480
that was way too much spending to get

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:23.460
something from here and I've been

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:26.010
rewarded with nothing in fact I have no

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.679
desire to take any of these and that's a

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.179
new low for boss rush is to go to it and

00:29:28.679 --> 00:29:36.830
be like all four of these items are

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:42.630
garbage so that's that's the new one is

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:45.770
the eihwaz rune el horrible well it's

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.770
not good

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.419
certainly in heck this is one of the

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:54.330
situations this rarely happens that you

00:29:51.419 --> 00:29:56.610
make the boss rush attempt and then when

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:59.700
you get there you go well everything is

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:03.059
bad I'm not talking about everything you

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:07.710
know being not worth it I mean these it

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:09.330
actually was stepped on creeper it

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.040
actually would have been bad for us to

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:13.830
step on a spike to pick up any of those

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.540
items maybe you can get some cool stuff

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:19.190
done with the clicker I don't know I

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.190
think that's a bit of a reach

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:31.580
but it's up to us to not lose this one

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:37.520
we paid much too large of a price trying

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:38.720
to make it the boss rush now we got a I

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.150
mean I'm making it sound like we're

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.810
about to begin the Battle of Helm's Deep

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:49.130
or something like that it's not the case

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:51.230
still just playing a video game here but

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.090
the video game is an extension in many

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:56.240
ways of you know mental and mechanical

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:58.820
prowess and it would be emasculating to

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.630
some extent to lose on a run in which

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:04.700
we've been given ample benefit not

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:08.420
ridiculous benefit but an ample benefit

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:11.090
no question so let's engage in the

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:13.370
mental exercise of saving ourselves from

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.320
a downward slope right now you ever you

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:18.020
know you're riding your bike riding your

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.930
bike uphill sucks you know it's a lot of

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:23.540
work you as soon as you get to like a 15

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:26.090
degree slope a 15 degree slope times

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.770
like a few hundred meters it's gonna

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.840
have you sweating bullets at least if

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:33.220
you're you know living the kind of

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.220
lifestyle I'm living most of the time

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:40.820
but at least there's control in going up

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:43.550
a hill going down a hill is actually

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.500
substantially more dangerous I mean I'm

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.940
not a professional cyclist dogs but in

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.530
my opinion it's more dangerous because

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.530
it's much harder to slow yourself down

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:57.260
when you're working you know against

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:58.880
gravity or grab as well you're not

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.710
really working again you get what I mean

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.990
you're trying to slow yourself the

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:05.780
descent when the laws of physics are

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:10.910
going not that was so dumb of me I

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:14.630
actually thought that my kilis triac

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:16.250
need actually a horrible boss fight for

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:18.650
us right now because we can't control

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:20.300
the damage that comes out of it some of

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:22.970
those attacks are almost impossible to

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.740
dodge so we did get an HP upgrade and

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.900
occurs to the unknown running away right

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:33.110
now would be very nice ok so we were we

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:34.350
were low on HP not quite dead but but

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:38.730
low

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:40.890
now if you'll excuse me I've got to sign

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:42.360
out of Skype here I'm not gonna belabor

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:49.410
the point where you hard in the

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:51.270
backgrounds gone blue okay never should

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:55.110
have taken so much damage on the devs

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:56.100
too but you know if ifs and buts were

00:32:55.110 --> 00:33:01.170
candy and nuts we'd all have a Merry

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:04.380
Christmas right would we I mean if I got

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:06.060
candies and nuts for Christmas and I'm

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.980
not even talking about candies nuts but

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.240
if we got candies and nuts for Christmas

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.370
I'd be pretty happy but I'm also you

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.930
know approaching 30 I'm at the point and

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.250
I've talked about this you know probably

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.140
every holiday season for like the last

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:20.040
three years of these Isaac videos but I

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:23.670
tend to receive less on Christmas these

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:25.680
days then I give and that's just there's

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:28.740
a natural balance of approaching a

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.260
certain age in life you know I'm sending

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:34.440
the elevator back down I'm at the point

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:36.090
where if I got like a $20 bill in a card

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.400
for my grandma I would have to collar

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.780
and be like grandma was I'm nearly 30

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.700
years old like we're approaching

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.860
ridiculousness here you know you got to

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.900
retire someday grandma think about this

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.570
$20 you got to put that in an index fund

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.340
tracking the performance with S&amp;P 500 at

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.780
7% annual leave so we're going to get I

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:58.190
mean that's just what it is we're going

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:58.190
to get hit here this room is hell

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:12.590
but it's not that Christmas is a or

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:15.290
holidays let's say it's not that the

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.790
holidays are about the game theory of

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.320
you know spending less than you receive

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.990
it's more about spending time with your

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.550
family obviously but candies and nuts

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:24.170
for Christmas at least I'm getting the

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.630
gift that I would be like you know I'll

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:29.560
eat these hey thanks for the candy I

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:33.320
have a great excuse to eat this now and

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:35.179
everybody knows that bad foods that you

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.470
get as a gift foods it's bad for you you

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.940
get as a gift when you eat it it doesn't

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:39.860
count to your body your body's like is

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.940
Christmas just send these calories

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.480
straight through you know we're not

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:46.730
holding on of these give them a break

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:49.850
it's the way it works also vacation

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:54.250
calories don't count we're probably

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.250
going to die let's let's resist that

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.520
because this run is I'll just level with

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.380
you

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.210
we should not die on today's run it's

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:07.160
not bad enough to die on it's not

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:09.410
amazing but it's far from bad enough to

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:12.140
die on we've got a good space bar item

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:14.930
our damage is you're going to say that

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:17.450
I'm you know moving the goalposts here I

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:21.680
don't think I am our damage is great

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:23.710
it's not a step above great at least not

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.710
yet

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:34.270
the real problem for us has been defense

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:36.220
and admittedly I've let a lot of bad

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:47.140
damage hit me especially over the course

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:49.540
of the past two floors or so but as long

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:53.440
as there is blood in my body we got a

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:55.600
chance here this is our chance to fight

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.790
back against the narrative of you know

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:03.880
once you lose you're more likely to lose

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:05.020
in the future we had a really like a

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.490
street that was going pretty well

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.140
although honestly a lot of those runs

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.100
were very easy if I'm being honest with

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:13.960
you

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:16.240
and then you know we lost on rerun after

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.210
building a run that to be honest with

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.950
you we could be proud of

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.570
take your time look for tinted rocks

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:29.530
here I can't tell if this is attended

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:33.040
rock it was not a tinted rock but it is

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:38.250
a decent Avenue wow that was one a heck

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:38.250
of a speedy attack there as you see that

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:49.800
tinted rocks please there is attempted

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:54.610
rock no small rock one spirit heart

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:59.250
guess who's back back again confidence

00:36:54.610 --> 00:37:01.570
Tara through ok don't get hit by that

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:04.500
and then of course he says guess who's

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.500
back you get the idea

00:37:06.089 --> 00:37:10.240
the other day I asked Michael al Fox I

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:12.819
said what's your favorite song with

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.140
Hello in it and he said you know I was

00:37:12.819 --> 00:37:16.000
thinking you know he got a lo by Adele

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:19.390
you got hello hello my place called

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.339
vertigo hello goodbye and he says does

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:23.349
hello have to be in the title I said no

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:25.990
ofcourse not vertigo is just called her

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:28.029
to go and then he said oh then in that

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:30.220
case my favorite song with hello and it

00:37:28.029 --> 00:37:33.250
is the one that goes hello my name is

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.539
what my name is who my name is Chieko

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.880
Slim Shady

00:37:34.539 --> 00:37:38.950
and at first I was like good answer I

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.779
didn't even think about that two six two

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.460
seconds later I said to myself he says

00:37:40.779 --> 00:37:43.089
hi not a lo what's this guy talking

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.569
about

00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:49.089
I can't tell to this day if he was if he

00:37:46.569 --> 00:37:51.789
was a joke master and he was trolling me

00:37:49.089 --> 00:37:53.200
or feed accidentally made a mistake one

00:37:51.789 --> 00:37:56.109
of which of course is acceptable the

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:59.099
other one is unforgivable I mean have

00:37:56.109 --> 00:38:02.680
you heard the Marshall Mathers LP oh

00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:06.069
you're an Eminem fan who's this then

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:10.720
holds up picture of devon Sawa dressed

00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:12.670
as mm from the Stan Musial video yeah I

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.099
know the name of the actor who played

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:19.480
stand in the stand music video you know

00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:20.890
why devon Sawa was famous not just for

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.690
that it's not like he was an extras they

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.940
hired to be in that he's just not famous

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:29.410
anymore but there was a time where he

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:31.480
was up he was like a b-tier JTP okay so

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.220
we I mean the a was earn is now useless

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.460
we should have used it I am it doesn't

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:39.490
really matter actually since it's all

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.059
about survival it's irrelevant I hate

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.849
these guys

00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:44.650
dude these freaking ghosts they get me

00:38:42.849 --> 00:38:47.400
now and I don't mean they get me in like

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:52.349
a you know you complete me sort away I

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.349
mean they have my number

00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:03.710
got him got him but if we can make it

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:05.540
through this room we can make it through

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:10.700
anything go for it do tella pills

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:12.860
oh I don't dislike it there are some

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:16.220
rooms that I will allow myself to take

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.420
damage on without I'm going to check and

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.710
see the secret rooms back here because

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:24.200
you know possibility of there being

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.520
spirit hearts is very important that

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.020
still might not have let's be honest

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.970
we're not going to use a team bond so

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:31.550
doesn't bother me there is no secret

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:40.300
room there we had to make sure had to

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:42.530
see you with my own two eyes good work

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.050
because there could be spirit hearts in

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.070
that secret room sorry in the curse room

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.310
so we had to go for there could be

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:50.660
health in the secret room as well which

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:53.930
would be of course very useful for us

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:55.420
but no such luck and you know what

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:58.460
that's okay

00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.200
ever since we've had the play better

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:06.410
we've played better and that's not

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:08.480
always guaranteed it's a bit of a tough

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:12.860
call isn't it because you sort of have

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:16.390
to open these the first one did not work

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:21.160
out but it did almost pay for itself

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:21.160
killed like 1/3 of the enemies here a

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:29.350
luck upgrade actually could win us the

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:32.390
game it's extremely wishful thinking but

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:40.160
see fishtail gave us more flies that

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:43.240
time unlikely to be super useful but

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.240
here we are

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:52.109
I think you have to blow this up looking

00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:53.999
for the secret room but also looking for

00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:55.959
chance to get something out of that

00:40:53.999 --> 00:40:57.459
technically we are in the key

00:40:55.959 --> 00:40:59.769
we don't have got details I wouldn't

00:40:57.459 --> 00:41:02.880
expect to need eight keys for a normal

00:40:59.769 --> 00:41:02.880
chest but it can happen

00:41:08.249 --> 00:41:15.819
this will be a great time for a hero

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:17.170
font card might not be the way it's

00:41:15.819 --> 00:41:19.959
actually pronounced but we've created

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:26.609
our own pronunciation for better or for

00:41:19.959 --> 00:41:34.029
worse ace of clubs actually basically

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:36.400
terrible although there might come a

00:41:34.029 --> 00:41:39.959
time een I guess I could foresee a

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:50.559
situation in which we do use 23 bombs

00:41:39.959 --> 00:41:52.779
but it's pretty unlikely actually seemed

00:41:50.559 --> 00:41:54.670
like a decent play there as I never

00:41:52.779 --> 00:42:02.140
thought of using the ace of blank

00:41:54.670 --> 00:42:07.179
preventively preventatively that was a

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:10.719
horrible place to stand so we we took a

00:42:07.179 --> 00:42:20.199
mimic out of the equation all there was

00:42:10.719 --> 00:42:21.369
a rock and a block after all that if we

00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:27.130
got hit by that ghost that would have

00:42:21.369 --> 00:42:30.130
been I would have been displeased now

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.809
for all the flack that I'm going to get

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:35.469
for this episode and much of it is

00:42:31.809 --> 00:42:39.069
deserved much of it is deserved you got

00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:41.559
to admit not a whole lot of help in the

00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:43.599
spirit heart or HP Department and many

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:44.170
points over the course of this run am I

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:47.789
wrong

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.789
I don't think I'm wrong

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:58.260
sure much of the damage we took should

00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:00.180
never have been taken but there are a

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:03.060
lot of runs in which I probably have

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:05.840
taken a lot worse damage but it sort of

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:09.770
gets glossed over by the fact that a

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:13.050
standard amount of spirit arts drops

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:16.800
drop suppose that has not happened here

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:18.870
I think we got to try this if you drop a

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.470
troll bomb I am never going to play this

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:37.350
game again until tomorrow so you know

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:39.960
balls in your court got to admit it gets

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:44.040
the people go in at least mystery sack

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:45.930
is an out for us but it's probably isn't

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.850
why Mia is definitely not a high

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:52.260
percentage out plus we got to live for a

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:53.820
while to potentially make use of it like

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.770
right now would be a really good time

00:43:53.820 --> 00:44:09.030
for it to pay out with anything like a

00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:10.560
nalgas ruin for example okay this is

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:12.810
alright three point five luck

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.110
I got hopes this could win us the game

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:19.140
it probably will not be enough but it

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.400
could an Ace of Hearts has a theoretical

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:27.870
chance to be useful if we could actually

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:29.700
get an HP upgrade at some point you're

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:31.320
really looking for algae's but I'll take

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.480
a brick on O room before an annoying

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.500
fight I guess fishtail maybe really only

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.500
does double flies

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:54.519
there we go one spirit heart completely

00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:58.180
changes my outlook on this run the devil

00:44:54.519 --> 00:45:00.519
also good for this boss fight

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.700
specifically we don't need our money for

00:45:00.519 --> 00:45:12.730
anything barn penny is not too relevant

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:14.230
right now but it should let you know

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.670
that I'm a little scared about the

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:17.440
situation that I still bothered to pick

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:22.450
it up okay so we're going to take the

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:26.440
devil card in here of course plus 1.75

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:27.819
damage is largely irrelevant when we're

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:32.079
talking about the amount of damage we

00:45:27.819 --> 00:45:34.539
got but largely irrelevant does not mean

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:42.130
useless and on a run that's a little

00:45:34.539 --> 00:45:44.849
close here I'll take it that should make

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.849
him disappear

00:45:50.499 --> 00:45:56.959
and now we'll make him disappear so

00:45:54.739 --> 00:45:59.890
assuming we don't get hit here how do we

00:45:56.959 --> 00:46:03.079
win it's a couple of a couple of waves

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:07.969
just getting an emperor card drop early

00:46:03.079 --> 00:46:12.439
enough would do it getting a respawn

00:46:07.969 --> 00:46:18.279
item preferably dark Judas or Lazarus

00:46:12.439 --> 00:46:18.279
rag actually in the chest would do it

00:46:20.049 --> 00:46:24.709
apart from them we're going to have to

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:27.979
fight for it and that doesn't interest

00:46:24.709 --> 00:46:30.019
me I am NOT built for fighting on this

00:46:27.979 --> 00:46:33.890
or I'm not built for love and either I'm

00:46:30.019 --> 00:46:35.509
neither a lover nor a fighter I think we

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:37.519
will take it before these these items

00:46:35.509 --> 00:46:42.890
are largely junk for us right now though

00:46:37.519 --> 00:46:44.630
and I know the myth of northern lion is

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:49.369
that even in this situation he would

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:51.949
take tiny planet if things were slightly

00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:53.419
better I would take tiny planet part of

00:46:51.949 --> 00:46:54.979
the thing is it's not going to help us

00:46:53.419 --> 00:46:56.689
on the tear cap to begin with sorry on

00:46:54.979 --> 00:46:59.029
that oh maybe it does lower your tier

00:46:56.689 --> 00:47:01.189
keV I'm not sure and with F before we

00:46:59.029 --> 00:47:06.549
might be able to roll with it but we're

00:47:01.189 --> 00:47:11.419
just too tight to to try it right now

00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:17.589
at before by the way is great we do have

00:47:11.419 --> 00:47:17.589
an issue and the issue is we can't use

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:29.530
red candle and still get the F before a

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:37.010
bonus simultaneously rosary is enormous

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:41.150
actually enormous rosary is like Plan C

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:43.520
done right dude item the majority of the

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:47.390
time you see it annoying and largely

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:48.920
worthless right now saving our run maybe

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.720
not largely worthless but usually when

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:54.410
you see it you go out rosary I'm going

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:56.300
to have to accommodate it now it's

00:47:54.410 --> 00:48:01.010
accommodating us and I thank you for

00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:03.410
that wait we can keep our rate of fire

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:06.590
room-to-room here with epic aura has

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:10.270
that always been the case if so never

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:10.270
stop shooting to the right direction

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:18.050
because a to rate of fire with a damage

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:20.120
is good enough man that is some super

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:29.840
powered soymilk territory I promise you

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:36.800
that so unicorn stump actually does

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:40.910
nothing for us we have no orbitals we

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:43.670
have peepers I it's approximately

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:45.850
negative 20% worth it to try to make

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:45.850
that happen

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:54.620
what have I done I got a I got a pivot

00:48:52.610 --> 00:49:00.670
we lost our rate of fire temporarily we

00:48:54.620 --> 00:49:03.080
can build it back though who cares right

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:06.050
keep it going keep it going

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.670
there's a 3/3 is pretty good right a

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:09.310
dead end regardless dude this is nine

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:13.910
lives

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:18.440
please let me kill nine lives man laughs

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:21.170
there we go we did not get nine lives

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:24.500
but an eternal heart is worth something

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:28.280
gosh darn it and I think we're going to

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:30.260
pull this one out I whether or not we

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:34.630
deserve it is you know that's for you

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:38.690
and the god of your choice to decide

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:43.070
because good lord some bad damage but I

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:45.760
still feel like we were also handed kind

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:48.590
of a bad draw here in terms of like ever

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:56.030
getting spirit hearts we could get some

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:58.340
can't act like we didn't get any less

00:49:56.030 --> 00:50:00.200
than average but we're going to complain

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:03.290
about something being less than average

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:06.110
on an Isaac run you know it's a little

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:08.330
tone deaf every run is deficiencies and

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:10.100
strengths and I do think our strengths

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:13.910
greatly outweigh our deficiencies at

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:19.390
least by this point start firing in this

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:19.390
direction now we to get Pisces

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:25.660
I guess we would prefer to get the virus

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:28.599
over anything else so stop shooting lust

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:32.230
if possible bombs are the worst though

00:50:28.599 --> 00:50:36.760
so at least kill sloth laughs now get a

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:38.590
good tarot card like the Emperor or

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.490
Bob's are on head it's another all-time

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:42.640
classic

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:44.440
okay panic power from adrenaline so the

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:52.510
longer you spend on a room the more

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:54.340
damage you do something like that longer

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:59.200
you spend on a floor the more damage you

00:50:54.340 --> 00:51:06.849
do I don't know dude all I'm asking for

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:08.800
is a way out of this floor eventually we

00:51:06.849 --> 00:51:10.119
have to hit every dead end on a run

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:17.710
where there's a little bit of a question

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:19.210
about our survivability I have 40 minute

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:22.240
Isaac run is no joke that's a little on

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:24.450
a longer side for a you know lately at

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.450
least

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:33.030
you know what we can totally use red

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:33.030
candle without compromising em perfora

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:37.780
I'm learning a lot about eff before ax

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.520
I'm learning you know it took me a while

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:43.000
to even respect it as an item which is a

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.380
personal failure but now I'm learning to

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.210
love it as an item and that's an

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:49.300
important step in my relationship with

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:52.980
that before because here's upgrades are

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:57.070
not always easy to come across

00:51:52.980 --> 00:52:05.370
I'll take them as I can find them we

00:51:57.070 --> 00:52:09.690
almost got it there okay we're actually

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:09.690
kind of in a terrible situation

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:23.240
it's okay kill sloth laughs not Bob's

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:29.780
rotten head please I'm begging you

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:36.650
oh my god you had to do it didn't you

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:43.790
this is the tough room dude this room is

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:46.280
like actually zero percent a joke dude

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:50.480
actually launches these doubled spiders

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:53.240
like right on top of me so honestly we

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:56.660
have activated like our Super Saiyan

00:52:53.240 --> 00:53:02.800
abilities just to survive as long as we

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:05.240
have on this room oh that was so close

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:14.869
it's hard to dodge them while they're in

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:17.090
the air that was heinous okay so what's

00:53:14.869 --> 00:53:19.790
the next step as long as there's no

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:24.200
mimics take your time and look for some

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:27.710
second secret rooms or some secret rooms

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:34.430
for that matter so be a really bad time

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:36.380
to die - you could probably make a case

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:37.849
for unicorn stump temporarily be a

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:44.030
really bad time to die - greed is what I

00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:45.410
was going to say it's fine are you a

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:50.859
wizard that's fine you just wait it out

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:50.859
who cares I'm a doctor too

00:54:06.809 --> 00:54:11.239
does not reroll every item on the floor

00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:17.909
so we basically just have to win easier

00:54:16.709 --> 00:54:20.009
said than done but if you think you're

00:54:17.909 --> 00:54:31.979
going to get hit so when you pop unicorn

00:54:20.009 --> 00:54:34.499
Stumpf better safe than sorry I don't

00:54:31.979 --> 00:54:36.439
expect to be entitled to kill blue baby

00:54:34.499 --> 00:54:41.640
in like an instant on every single run

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:45.449
but I will say it is taken forever here

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:48.569
if you want to be true to the run and be

00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:51.059
a total scumbag we could stand still get

00:54:48.569 --> 00:54:56.130
not leave to work and have peepers I

00:54:51.059 --> 00:54:58.469
kill every enemy that is something that

00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:00.989
would work it's going to take forever

00:54:58.469 --> 00:55:04.229
and on a way in a way that's actually

00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:06.929
like worse than a loss that's a loss of

00:55:04.229 --> 00:55:08.939
dignity now if we were dealing with a

00:55:06.929 --> 00:55:15.479
streak of any magnitude I might consider

00:55:08.939 --> 00:55:18.089
it but just a normal blue baby run is a

00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:19.979
requisite skill as an Isaac player to be

00:55:18.089 --> 00:55:21.449
able to kill blue baby without getting

00:55:19.979 --> 00:55:24.929
him not saying you should be able to do

00:55:21.449 --> 00:55:26.309
it every time but some of the time you

00:55:24.929 --> 00:55:28.759
should be able to kill blue baby without

00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:28.759
getting hit

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:38.920
we've almost got it already it looks

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:40.480
like we've done it so that was scary we

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.650
did redeem ourselves maybe somewhat at

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.180
the end so thanks for watching hope you

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:44.260
enjoyed it if you did click the like

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.070

subscribe you are if you are in the

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:49.800
future for now thanks for watching and
