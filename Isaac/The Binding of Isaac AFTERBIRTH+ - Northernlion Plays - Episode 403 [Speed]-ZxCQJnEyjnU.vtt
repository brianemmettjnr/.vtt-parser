##

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.220
everybody welcome back to normal and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.990
please binding lines again truth Plus on

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
the last episode we did xxx

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.660
please somebody rescue me spin that

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.960
record baby did it do do I forgot this

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.160
is a the worst challenge in the freakin

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.369
video game good lord LBZ eh 9 9 b i also

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.160
mashed up like 20 songs there so how

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.080
does speed work you get 16 minutes to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.019
beat the run all the way through to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.270
mom's heart this took us a million years

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.930
last time everything's that doubled

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.910
speed or you know roughly doubled speed

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.469
I should say except for the timer the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.950
timer moves that you know one second

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.329
equals one second but it's a it's a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.879
freaking nightmare this challenge was

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.030
probably doubtlessly the hardest one I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.250
had in after birth it took me like I

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.520
think I had to do one video where I just

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.420
did this challenge but I will say a very

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.830
good start for us here is in the books

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.150
with infestation - the problem is it's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.680
going to be very tough for us because

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.290
everything is moving twice as fast it's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.180
going to be very tough for us to not

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.650
take damage and the secure the deal with

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.880
the devil on the next floor and thus

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.259
have the best chance possible to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
complete this but I'm going to give it a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.100
try because you know why wouldn't we

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.320
write the complete this challenge early

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.380
would be very nice for me and kind of a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.950
little bit of redemption after not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.570
necessarily crushing the first two or

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.920
the 1st suite of challenges that we had

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.720
available to us like particularly

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.070
failing head trauma was a little silly

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
but I digress

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.479
now I probably should use the bomb to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
finish you off but I really want to use

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.960
a bomb to get a tinted rock and spirit

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.320
art on the next floor so if you could

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
just die that would be excellent

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.130
you are now dead thank you very much I

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.840
don't think we took too long there

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.610
should we have taken shorter or less

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.460
time I would love to don't get me wrong

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.540
but at the same time I'm not sure what

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.719
else that could have really done about

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.590
it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.319
dude the music sounds super cool sped up

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.170
like this it's like a brand new track

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.459
and fudge wrap you can have it back some

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.900
enemies are I'm not going to say they're

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.000
going to be on dodge able because again

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.859
our speed is going to be higher as a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.599
result of the challenge to begin with

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.250
but they're going to be tough to dodge

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.379
especially enemies that have like almost

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.250
no tell to their animations these guys

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.079
should be relatively easy but I also

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.370
think the speed might affect the physics

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.319
for some enemies like that guy was

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.859
firing shots way further than I would

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.569
normally expect that's not a spirit of

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:48.000
hard but it's not bad and I think we do

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.560
want big chubby up in NYC I still kind

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.139
of want to go to the shop because again

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.900
like mapping is super important but ok

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:00.590
this boy is - oh I guess the creep just

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.790
doesn't dissipate in the speed challenge

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.519
thereby making it like literally

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.590
impossible to succeed so sweet thank you

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.909
for that I really appreciate that one

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.819
anyway we're down to the next floor we

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.549
at least got two tiers upgrade yo if

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.919
you're going to make everything go twice

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.030
as fast the creeps should dissipate

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:22.680
twice as fast I actually don't know if

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.239
there's a way that we could have done

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.409
that without getting hit except possibly

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.109
I suppose it might have been conceivable

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.479
to like just drop a bomb and get his

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.209
progress and then kill him but I don't

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:39.989
know it was I'm sceptical to that what

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.430
it works so you can see on the speed

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.799
challenge dude when it rains it pours

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.239
like we actually have gotten pretty

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.909
lucky I think we have like maybe an

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.019
eight or a nine out of ten start here

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:53.280
might actually take a ten to win this

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.650
challenge I haven't even done the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.840
arithmetic yet of what the timing needs

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.549
to be to make a win on the Speed

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.720
Challenge plausible these are nightmare

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.519
enemies by the way you have eight floors

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.849
in 16 minutes you have two minutes per

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.849
floor

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.640
not only do we have to be fast though we

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.200
also have to survive which strikes me as

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.470
probably being a little bit more of a

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:25.180
challenge right now oh my god

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.830
I thought we were cool man so there goes

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.690
our deal with the devil chants in all

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.300
likely they're gonna place a bomb oh no

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.970
I'm not because I don't have a bomb this

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.970
is where I'd place a bomb if I had one

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.630
it really front-loaded the BS challenges

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:52.300
an afterbirth huh

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:56.470
Oh No why not dude oh this is also a

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:01.360
pretty bad draw far as bosses I don't

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:05.320
want to fight go oh my lord dude they do

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.310
not pull any punches yep okay okay okay

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.840
restart restart my god that was a just a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.419
nasty spawn

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.740
I blame blighted ovum because who knows

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.260
we might have gotten like brimstone in

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.180
that item room or in that in that Devil

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.650
Room I should say okay I mean there's

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.650
something to say about Holy Light

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.110
imagine buying The Binding of Isaac

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.400
after birth you know I haven't played

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.080
this game in a while maybe I'll start

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.000
with the challenges okay that one took

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.919
90 minutes and then this one is

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.630
borderline oh I placed the bomb there

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.310
borderline impossible okay I'm letting

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.919
them get inside of my head here just

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.740
slow your roll you can work your way

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:51.330
through this holy light is great all you

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.800
got to do is actually land these shots

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.080
I'm not even going to say anything about

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.000
the fact that I think it's a little rich

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.680
that we find ourselves fighting like the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.050
hardest bosses in the game on this

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.090
challenge that that's just life dude it

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.160
is what it is but hey would it kill you

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.270
to give me like a single Larry jr. or

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.590
something like that I mean I recognize

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.640
you're not trying to give me you know

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.270
any charity here yet at the same time

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.900
[Music]

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.150
all of the Holy Light shots are missing

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.450
Wow okay I think we got very lucky there

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.130
like the shots of the fired didn't hit

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.880
because the shot height was too high or

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.780
something ridiculous I'll take it well

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.160
we're going to leave this floor in

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.420
roughly two minutes but this isn't the

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.850
one that I'm worried about this is the

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:42.530
shortest one so we did like greatly

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.820
increase our speed to make this happen I

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.250
think that was very good though

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.590
Lasky's fine the HP will keep us alive a

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.810
little bit like the eternal heart will

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.850
keep us alive a little bit longer than

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.980
we otherwise would be set up here by the

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.990
way if you're waiting for like the point

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.150
of which we start having like funny

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.510
commentary on this episode I wouldn't

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:06.230
necessarily get your hopes up not sure I

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.430
have it in me to do some you know go on

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.550
a bit here well I got to maintain

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.880
supreme focus but in a way it's okay

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.370
because it is kind of no tinted rock it

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.590
is kind of unique in the Isaac Pantheon

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:22.870
or the Isaac collection as far as

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:26.420
challenge runs go this one is I mean a

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:30.260
singularly on its own in terms of what

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:34.520
it is and then be also probably the most

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.930
difficult in the whole game even if a

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.330
lot of that difficulty from my

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:41.540
perspective is that it's just not

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.120
designed very well not to AH

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.740
not to be completely you know Drude to

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.550
it but okay a black marketeer could

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.230
change a lot

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:55.490
we need mapping this is not mapping of

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:57.500
any variety I think we got a swing to

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.500
the fences so take buddy in a box and

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.890
that's sadly like the only great one

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.600
there and even that is not great but I

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.310
needed something that improved us

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.790
offensively and that's as good as it got

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.790
in there unfortunately

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.660
maybe like pay-to-play doesn't matter I

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:18.360
think in fact it's probably just bad

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.330
considering the HP requirements for this

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.630
run potentially uh what else was there

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.610
in there like but bottle of pills maybe

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:30.210
you can get lucky with some bottle of

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.980
pills but so I let's try it let's try it

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:35.040
huge growth

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.780
it could be worthwhile just pop this

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.970
right here and get a huge damage upgrade

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:42.990
kill pin guaranteed deal with the devil

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:44.910
and then please God a good deal good

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.140
enough not good enough to make me feel

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.980
like we got a great chance but good

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:51.690
enough to feel like we in this so I'm

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.380
going to push forward here and go to the

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:57.360
item room because I feel like you kind

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.010
of it might seem like it's going to slow

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.570
us down but I think you've got to make

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.340
these low percentage plays they have a

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.140
good chance to win speed or maybe you

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.240
don't I mean I am talking out of my butt

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.740
to some extent I will sacrifice the

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.400
spirit art to get God's flesh

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.660
mostly because it showed up and I

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.220
certainly should not have gone for that

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.720
but let's have this payout with crickets

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.270
head and solve all of our problems

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:25.320
please world card versus hermit we take

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.910
world for certain okay so I mean we're

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.610
worse off than we were on the last run

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.400
but we're alive which is better than the

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.960
last run it takes a lot to get me to do

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.660
that room it's also going to take a lot

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.080
to drag me away from you there's nothing

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.360
that a hundred men or more could ever do

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.310
okay so guffy chances exist I thought it

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.400
was a weird little curled-up weird

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.690
literal curled up snake that we had as

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.940
our buddy in a box but I think it's

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:56.100
actually some kind of all I was so kind

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.810
of weird like amoeba or something dude I

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.740
will take little monstro assuming he

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:04.980
charges twice as fast I'm a relatively

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:07.680
happy camper because he can do quite a

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.090
lot of damage we do have more bombs we

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:16.560
should go to the curse room right away

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:19.490
because in doing so we can maybe get

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.170
like Guppies head would be 10 out of 10

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.530
obviously but like for real in this

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.740
situation tenets and

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.630
we ruined our chance out of impatience

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.910
to get skeleton key it's a little bit of

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:33.400
a bummer but this isn't as your standard

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:35.560
vanilla run you know if this was a

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.700
vanilla run I'd be like dang I just

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.260
ruined my chance to get an item we

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.580
almost never see but because of speed

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.140
I'm like hey at least you didn't spend

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.050
more than two seconds thinking about it

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.960
we needed that and I'm going to try

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.760
something a little bold here give us

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.470
just enough money and a luck upgrade to

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.120
get this and then this is the two of

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:55.000
spades which at least allows us to go to

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.830
remaining item rooms I'm very very

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.840
tempted don't get me wrong to check on

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:05.340
that to check on that golden chest but

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:08.260
I'm going to abstain for the time being

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.690
without knowing how valuable like the

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:14.050
keys that we have are I don't feel

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:17.620
comfortable just throw-in some away so

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.120
remarkably we're still on pace as long

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.250
as we can beat this boss within the next

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.890
let's give ourselves little tolerance we

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.750
can beat them dang it if you can beat

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:30.280
the boss within the next 40 seconds or

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:33.670
so consider it relatively on pace but

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.740
we're slowing down and we're certainly

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:41.290
not going to get a deal with the devil

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:45.010
here or shouldn't expect to at least we

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:47.470
might have a chance no but well scent is

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.660
good and again pretty much on schedule

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.140
but the more teleportation cards the

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.390
merrier

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.930
as long as they take us where we want to

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:57.910
go oh okay I mean I don't know if I've

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:01.060
ever seen this payout with like a ten

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.440
out of ten pill just being very cautious

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:08.190
because I don't want to ruin our devil

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:11.530
chance here unfortunately dude thank you

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:15.220
but if these are even okay it might be a

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.360
huge help power pill versus two of

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.840
spades I mean I think we should take

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:24.650
power pill into our rooms with us

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:28.550
I am an idiot I am an idiot I'm just

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.960
going to cause so much backtracking if

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.090
we're going to go back for a power pill

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.370
like literally every time so I don't

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.290
want to go back literally every time but

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.810
I do want to go back like on occasion

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.820
here and apparently I'm an idiot for

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.860
doing so because on the catacombs you

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.730
only fight enemies that are like across

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:48.350
a bridge from you and as a result

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.000
there's no reason to be invincible and

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:56.300
and turn yourself into like pac-man

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.370
I think we're holding it together though

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.310
this would be a really big floor to get

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.990
a nice hole that was close to get a nice

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:11.780
like deal with the devil improvement

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:16.270
this is fine he did not get hit by that

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.270
am i living in fantasy island

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:27.439
well I mean at this point I don't know

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:30.410
should we make it an effort to get more

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:33.529
power pills going back for to a spades

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:35.569
or none of the above right like kind of

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:37.309
getting like really strapped for time

00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:39.379
we're at the point where we're behind

00:13:37.309 --> 00:13:41.509
schedule the idea being that we can get

00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:45.350
ahead of schedule but only if things get

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:48.499
strong and to luck with gimpy is is a

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:52.879
start a very good chance of improving

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:56.480
our survival I would suggest not fully

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:58.309
convinced of its ability to make us go

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:04.129
faster but you know what hey thanks to

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:07.089
the spirit art I think we need to save

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:10.869
our money in the hopes of getting a

00:14:07.089 --> 00:14:13.369
magic mushroom in the hopes of getting a

00:14:10.869 --> 00:14:19.699
mapping item on future floors I think we

00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:22.339
just save our money for now play the

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:25.249
percentages here we're going to be

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:28.160
almost two minutes behind schedule which

00:14:25.249 --> 00:14:30.549
I mean in layman's terms means we're

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.549
screwed

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:37.850
unless a deal with the devil that we

00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:43.220
didn't even expect to have a chance to

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:46.100
earn please lord stop moving and yet

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.839
also give me the holy light shot that I

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.660
desire in order to have a chance of

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:52.579
success how we didn't get hit there is

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.959
basically like I can only assume divine

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:57.139
intervention thank you

00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:58.059
troll engine you've done me a solid for

00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:00.709
once

00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:03.730
thank you placenta for the res in there

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:03.730
don't think I didn't see that

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:12.730
and we got a guppy item it's it's it

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.900
what is it man I don't know where I've

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:18.490
been asking myself that same question

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:20.410
ever since the song came out could you

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:23.820
stop blocking the only shots I have that

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.820
deal a decent amount of damage please

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.410
one thing's for certain I'm very glad I

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.880
took the time to do one normal run in

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.990
the middle of these challenges before

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:41.560
starting the afterbirth ones because the

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:46.780
afterbirth ones are a problem I think we

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:49.740
have to go my dream here we got a black

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:54.940
heart from poop Wow

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:56.260
my oh my dream here is we get a deal

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.580
with the devil and then we come back go

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.980
to the curse room completely guppy

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.860
trifecta and then give ourselves a very

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:05.590
very small chance to actually win the

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.390
Speed Challenge I think we're playing

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.430
from behind right now I think we don't

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:12.130
have a great seed for beating the the

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:14.710
speed challenge so I'm not going to feel

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.090
too bad if all of our you know dreams

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.460
come to fruition and we still lose

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:21.790
because I don't think that this is a

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:24.250
very winnable speed seed which is a

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:25.900
strange sentence to say but certainly

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.850
we're going to give it a try regardless

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:32.560
we did get a deal with the devil no

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:35.320
Krampus please it's Krampus all right if

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:41.560
he ever spins we basically just take

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:43.510
damage I don't I don't care if we get

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.790
hit more we need something even Krampus

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.870
was head is fine there and then we need

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.730
to go to the curse room even though it's

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.770
going to cost us our black heart there's

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:53.160
a small chance there's to guppy items in

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:55.570
there we got it we got to roll with it

00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:02.170
that does not appear to be to guppy

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:05.650
items well I'm going to just peep one

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:09.280
more room my idea was maybe just maybe

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:12.730
it'll be the the shop here but we're

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.890
we're in sight we're going down to the

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.300
depths - we have a minute less than we

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.289
would like to have which i think is very

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.010
bad

00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:22.640
especially because the floor is like

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:25.640
only get longer right or at the very

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.649
little s potentially incorrect they're

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.750
certainly not getting any smaller I

00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:34.190
don't know if the womb is actually any

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:36.799
larger than the desk but it's kind of

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.299
secondary to the whole thing I did not

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:44.179
get hit there we have had some

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:45.529
miraculous saves I know we want to steal

00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:47.840
with the devil but we have to go to the

00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:53.179
cursed room regardless and we've already

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:56.230
taken damage I think so sadly sort of

00:17:53.179 --> 00:18:01.010
worth it we're rewarded for our

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:03.529
ineptitude there still to this day that

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.210
room can slop my knob as far as I'm

00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:07.850
concerned just doesn't make any darn

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:09.770
sense there is a full run reroll I don't

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:13.429
think backtracking for the full run

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:18.049
rerolls is very likely to come to

00:18:13.429 --> 00:18:19.640
fruition here we sort of like you might

00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:21.620
say you got to try something you got to

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.110
try a Hail Mary I think there is an

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:26.200
outside chance if we get like mad lucky

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:28.669
and get like an emperor card we can

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.460
maybe swing this but it's going to it

00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:33.590
would be very close for certain so but

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:38.230
at this point we have to swing for the

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:41.270
fences because the fences are all we got

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:42.860
not to put too fine a point on it say

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:46.159
I'm the only bee in your bonnet not to

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.799
put too fine a point on it I think we

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:52.070
will basically lose unless we get a deal

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:54.110
with the devil here or like an early

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:56.090
Emperor card on the next floor somehow

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.490
we did not get a deal with the devil I

00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.590
mean you got a look I don't know what

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.990
out if I got like a teleport item in

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.820
there that could have been useful but

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.710
yeah we're just we're too tight on time

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:11.000
here I don't think is anything you can

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:13.789
really a mustard and that's kind of like

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.990
the deal breaker right there it's a dead

00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:17.580
ends

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.470
well we're still going to play it out

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:25.650
and give it a shot but I've kind of lost

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:27.960
hope a little bit we really did make a

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:30.120
solid attempt at it here with you know

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.460
five point six damage and base rate of

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:38.100
fire I don't think anyone could accuse

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:41.220
us of just capitulating to the game yet

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.620
at the same time I think we you know

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:48.290
we've exhausted our our best chances

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:50.460
here probably always good to you know

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.290
focus on the positives of what you did

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.760
and then also simultaneously look for

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:57.840
improvement you know what we'll say a

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.850
big get for us a buddy in a box I

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.280
actually think that item is not really

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.290
that good but good on me to recognize

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.930
that in that situation it was maybe one

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:10.200
of the one of the few chances we had to

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:12.150
make something big happen or at least

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.310
make something make the run happened

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.560
within the realm of plausibility so I

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.910
got it I got to give myself a little pat

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.180
on the back for that at least because

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:23.250
it's a it's an unusual way to you know

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:31.790
in enact some form of momentum on a run

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:31.790
but this is this is not a nice room

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:39.150
that was pretty nasty that's what we

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.770
need basically but it would be better if

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.360
it were the Emperor and we are in a

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.100
position where beggars can be choosers

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.560
right now because otherwise we're about

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.800
to get chosen by the god of time itself

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:53.880
to be killed so I'm happy with the world

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:57.090
card but without you know unlimited

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:59.220
bombs I still don't see this happening

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:02.550
even if we know which way we're supposed

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.990
to go okay so we're gonna have an 18

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.650
percent chance on a deal with the devil

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:10.680
here a deal with the devil that gives us

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.690
guppy would be amazing at this point

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.690
even if we got an emperor card I don't

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:18.210
know dude an emperor card plus guppy

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:20.310
would probably do it didn't get the

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.290
emperor card got a spear at art how do

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.820
you do this I mean you basically we're

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:29.610
gonna have like ten seconds to beat

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:35.340
mom's heart at best so rooms that are

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:38.540
not that tough just get killed rooms

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.540
that are large get blown up

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:49.180
rooms that are even mildly annoying get

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.180
blown up now that's fine actually fine

00:21:51.040 --> 00:22:05.570
you got to go you got to go what's the

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:09.080
other way forward for us get like all of

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:10.550
the Holy Light shots immediately I mean

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:18.050
I can't I can't bomb through this room

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:24.500
so hands are kind of tied here got 22

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:26.480
seconds just focus dude you have a

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.610
spirit art you have gimpy your placenta

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.610
there's like an off chance you could

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.990
live you really like your only hope is

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.640
to just put out as much damage as

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.220
possible in the next five seconds is not

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.200
going to happen

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:42.050
we're dead okay well we're going to give

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:45.680
this one more try here because I'm like

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:52.240
a little upset that rush was extremely

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:52.240
annoying Bumbo huh not necessarily bad

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:59.900
the bummer as well is that that run is

00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:04.760
probably still like markedly above

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:08.690
average it does burn a little bit

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:10.580
knowing that like we were really only

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.530
thirty seconds away from making a win

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.940
happen there we should let bumbo take

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.600
the money I guess although we kind of

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.600
need the mapping

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.790
so if we had ever done anything that

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.020
optimize that run by like 30 seconds we

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.680
would have probably come out with a

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:31.420
victory but we would have still had to

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:33.910
kill mom I also like I take a little bit

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.380
of issue I'm not saying oh I'm such an

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:40.030
Isaac god no one should ever be a

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:43.090
challenge for me why so many rooms where

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:45.000
the enemies you know our knowing attack

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:48.070
by the way why am I not using on soos

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.170
because I want to use on soos for a

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:53.620
larger floor because even if it only

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:57.150
makes a mild difference in terms of time

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:59.200
save that mile difference could be

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:01.930
extremely important by the end of the

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:05.010
run so I hate this this little horn is

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:07.300
going to take a million years to kill

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.310
stop shooting those and just blow

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.230
yourself up with a bomb please or that's

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:15.360
fine if you just want to walk into the

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.360
fire I will accept this

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:25.080
I just you don't create bombs huh I

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.130
don't want to be on schedule I want to

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.590
be ahead of schedule

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.360
a speed upgrade is actually not

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:33.390
altogether that good in my opinion

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.070
because we're already us walking quickly

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:37.220
is far from the biggest problem here I

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:39.360
guess it's what I'm trying to suggest

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:44.370
being able to stand further away from

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:50.460
enemies is a perhaps and adverse the

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:55.200
mild bonus we have to save our bombs for

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:56.940
now I don't know the more time goes on

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.220
here the less disappointed I feel in

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:03.780
that last run actually feel like we kind

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:05.850
of did all right by us by my own

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:10.980
standards with one damage upgrade over

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:13.020
the course of that whole run to hold it

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.750
together for that long or in some deals

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.550
with the devil give ourselves a chance

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:20.880
things go slightly differently on that

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:22.800
one we might come away with the win this

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.570
is a real problem yet there goes our

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.880
deal with the devil chanson and probably

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.650
dust Lee I'm just going to hold our and

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:33.810
restart because I really don't think

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:37.890
that one's going to work this is a good

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:41.870
start I'm a little bit perturbed that

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.870
attack fly rotates at normal speed

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:49.830
because we needed we would like it to be

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:52.140
faster need is a strong word oh dude I'm

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:54.810
a fan of the speed at which we got

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.160
through this floor attack fly might be

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.990
our saving grace here and this might not

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.060
seem like that big of a deal and in many

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.510
ways it's actually not to just get a tax

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.980
lie

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:09.630
however us finishing the first floor in

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:10.830
35 seconds is a huge deal it took us two

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.360
minutes on the last floor and we were

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:14.780
arguably like a little bit better

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.780
equipped

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:23.370
attack flight not rotating quickly is

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:26.279
actually very irritating though because

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:28.440
the enemies are so much faster I'm just

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:30.149
I recognize this is an issue is probably

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.850
never going to be fixed it's a little

00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:35.220
bit of a niche concern but it's annoying

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.690
nonetheless is that oh by the way the

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.250
creep doesn't last

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:41.100
are they sorry the creep lasts twice as

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:44.250
long as well so that'll screw you

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.809
and then a tax fly doesn't rotate as

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:49.740
fast it doesn't screw you put to get a

00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:52.440
mild disadvantage it's like the

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.779
challenge is challenging enough to find

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.679
a seam and then have that seam

00:26:54.779 --> 00:27:00.480
invalidated by it being an edge case so

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:02.720
it's not accounted for is a little

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.720
annoying

00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:10.559
we need bombs in spite of the fact that

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.419
we need to go fast I do think it's

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:14.639
probably smart to look for a bomb but

00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:17.429
you know what we do have a chance of

00:27:14.639 --> 00:27:20.309
getting a deal with the devil here this

00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:21.690
is not a great boss to be fighting wait

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:26.130
a minute we have bombs we could have

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:29.330
just don't be an idiot you can't get too

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:33.049
close but don't be an idiot here oh I

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.049
hate you so much

00:27:35.419 --> 00:27:39.630
okay you know what deal with the devil

00:27:37.769 --> 00:27:41.340
gone but at least we preserved some

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:44.460
bombs and we're still going fast here

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.720
but I'm I'm a little cheese please don't

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.990
give me something that would have given

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:53.669
me an easy fight here yeah okay that

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:55.200
really doesn't change much but that

00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:57.450
one's my own mistake and that's what

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.269
burns so much but you know what we not

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.950
even messing with you with an orbital

00:27:59.269 --> 00:28:05.370
ochre sublime Oh No

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:10.710
with an orbital we really need defensive

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:12.410
items because basically I can kill

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:17.420
anything

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:19.040
I just need help because we're going to

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.620
take some damage in the process I mean

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.750
this is it's already usually a dumb idea

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.490
to use your orbital to deal all damage

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:27.800
it's a little different when you got

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.720
attack fly working with you because it's

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.180
it's further out then it keep a meter of

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:39.970
all advantages but still a dicey

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:49.550
decision smart fly revenge fly okay

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:58.550
we're building something I believe there

00:28:49.550 --> 00:29:02.270
is a chance here I wish that the revenge

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.750
fly was a little bit better before you

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.430
get hit

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.430
after you get hit it's a lovely creature

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.920
of course I think we're and this is me

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:13.330
making a deliberate decision that you

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:17.390
may disagree with here but I'm going to

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:19.070
probably just accept that our deals with

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.050
the devil are going to be unlikely we're

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.150
going to go extremely aggro and just

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.190
hope that we get like another gimpy in

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:29.750
our item room or something like not on

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:33.350
this floor but on this run because I

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:35.530
think that you got to access like a

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:38.240
different portion of your brain to

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:41.830
complete the speed challenge and that

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:47.000
that portion of the brain right now is

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:51.800
there's a heart somewhere here is how do

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.080
we save time forever basically I'm a

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:59.300
little cheese still at a tack fly I

00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:02.510
think a tack fly is kind of muted by the

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.860
fact that it's not rotating here but you

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.740
know it's not rotating quickly but you

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.120
know what here's our chance

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:11.450
we got a one-third chance of a deal with

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.960
the devil hundreds of times we've beaten

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.960
those odds

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.570
but we have to not get hit not least of

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.880
which because getting hit will probably

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:22.350
kill us yeah there we go okay well

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:28.559
that's gonna do it for this episode

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:30.330
