00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
hey everybody welcome back to new in

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.759
line please the binding of issac

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.360
afterbirth plus we're uh we've been

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.490
unkillable lately it's been nice Isaac

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.530
that's good we won with Lilith last time

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.759
the lost the time before that and the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.779
keeper the time before that

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:23.189
Isaac's a nice break vx NL h r TP

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.750
thankfully not an excel floor it could

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.460
have been and that would have thrown me

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.500
for a loop but instead we get a year of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.510
rune a crystal ball the crystal ball

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.660
does not come with a spear at heart

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.180
sadly we d6 it and get the quarter and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.989
honestly first floor quarter it's about

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.219
as good as it gets I was going to make a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.390
joke about basketball and then I

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.129
realized I don't know anything about

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.219
basketball the only thing I know about

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.219
basketball is that apparently if you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.910
have like two really good players you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.829
can't be stopped it's kind of cool you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.750
know the NHL I watch a lot of hockey

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.430
well I don't watch a lot of hockey

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.260
because I watch Canucks games and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.809
they've been officially out of the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.580
playoff running for like five and a half

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.290
months obviously didn't make the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.090
playoffs and then beyond that we're

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
pretty terrible for the last several

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.150
months of the year they lost something

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.710
like 18 out of the last 20 games which

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.680
is good but then we also lost the draft

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.960
lottery really badly so you know what

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.960
fifth overall pick see it doesn't matter

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.799
we're going to talk about something else

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.420
but in hockey there's there's more

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.759
parity than in other sports I think

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.140
teams can be good for a long time but

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.380
there's a lot of kind of like changing

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.790
of the guard you know that all the teams

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.650
that are in like the conference finals

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.500
right now none of them have been to the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.290
conference finals except maybe Anaheim

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.970
if they end up beating Edmonton because

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.710
that game has just started in the past

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.290
like five years or something like that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.119
so you know it doesn't happen you go on

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.310
the Superbowl Patriots Patriots Patriots

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.380
Broncos Patriots Packers Packers Broncos

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.090
Patriots you know I understand there's a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.710
salary cap in all these leagues but

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.009
still I'm not insulting football either

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.810
sometimes you know it's unfortunate I

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.329
guess it did happen in the NHL for a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.819
while it was like you know you go back

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.340
to the 2000s Devil's avalanche Devil's

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.450
avalanche avalanche Devils you know and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.560
then it was Pittsburgh Detroit

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.900
Pittsburgh Detroit

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.709
Detroit Pittsburgh Chicago Los Angeles

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.540
Chicago Los Angeles cago my favorite

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.700
city in Los Angeles wonderful State this

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.660
time of year and I don't know what I'm

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.330
talking about

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.950
I'm just salty but also happy that the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.170
Toronto Raptors got knocked out in four

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.330
games salty because I mean I'd like to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.670
see Canada win in basketball because

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.310
it's patently ridiculous but also pretty

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.810
cool it would be like watching Phoenix

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.260
win the Stanley Cup or something like

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.330
that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.690
implausible in the near future but maybe

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.850
one day but also happy because that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.890
means that there are other highlights on

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.420
Toronto sports networks I don't live in

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.640
Toronto but you know we got a small

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.080
educational base education entertainment

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.480
base that's what I'm trying to say

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.030
subscriber base on our cable channels so

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.680
we all get Toronto Sports News anyway

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.299
you get the idea is where my even coming

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.790
from with this the point is I hate

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.890
sauerkraut the point is actually I do

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.080
not hate sauerkraut I'm for it the point

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:19.170
is no greed fight which is not greed no

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.109
dukkha flies fight should ever take

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.590
longer than three minutes and 15 seconds

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:28.680
on the first floor it's a bad Bernie

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.829
Sanders impression by a person who's not

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.600
even in the nation okay that's it don't

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.920
even point out the fact that the frame

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.019
rate dipped because of a Skype message

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.390
trust me I'm aware I've pointed out the

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.950
absurdity so many times that it's it's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.739
functionally at this point is beating a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.780
dead horse I swear these dudes wait off

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.549
so good until I swear these do three

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.100
where is this episode going man I got no

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.530
idea either way we finally killed dukkha

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.660
flies we got a nice damage bonus still a

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.940
little sore from that tears downgrade

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.220
but we got the diplopia this is actually

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.440
quite good because you use diplopia

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.480
right away you get a d6 with a full

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.190
charge you want to grab that you want to

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.959
grab this if you want to be with me baby

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.209
there's a price to pay I'm a genie in a

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.109
bottle baby you gotta rub me the right

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.360
way you roll it again BOGO bombs is good

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.940
but if we get a free roll I'd rather

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.690
roll it again we get trinkets melter so

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.420
for free

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.210
we get a hold of petrified poop you

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.640
might think that that seems like a bit

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.700
of a whiff but honestly I actually think

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.170
trinkets melter is a good get at the way

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.880
in considering we basically got it for

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.010
free or for the price of diplopia as

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.180
like a huge package deal it's I think

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.290
it's pretty good because it's basically

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.280
petrified poop plus another trinket so

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.810
it's almost like we're also getting

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.980
mom's purse along with it although we

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.350
don't have the option to ever get rid of

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.060
petrified poop I still think not bad

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.510
it's not like we're going to roll with

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.830
the long term anyway so I think we got a

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.140
decent case to be made here for now I'm

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.850
just going to keep playing this guy and

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.540
open for the best a black rune is very

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.760
good does it

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.770
it doesn't suck up consumables right I I

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.780
recently got burned thinking it does

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.780
suck up consumables but I don't think it

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.040
sucks up consumables now we back off a

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.930
little bit and play this guy because we

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.780
want to get our money back I'm sorry our

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.550
HP back but I definitely want the demon

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.370
judgment to pay out that can be a big

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.370
pivot for us chariot card is wonderful

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.400
caffeine pills not what we're looking

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.300
for but a speed upgrade it's not bad

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.270
what makes you larger is bad but life

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.980
goes on considering we got petrified not

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.540
petrified but also petrified poop

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.150
considering we got magic mushroom on the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.590
last floor we should be at a low low low

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.640
risk of dying if we do die it's like

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.680
great personal failing so I would accept

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.910
my own my own role in that demise

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.290
without a doubt now I'm hoping to get

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.480
some extra HP here we're already well

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.460
past the point where we can maximize or

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.010
optimize our HP for the deal with the

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.470
devil unless we got like there are rare

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.970
like five or six item deals with the

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.700
devil and maybe we could have taken

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.460
advantage of but it's low percentage for

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.350
certain so we're going to roll with the

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.750
black rune here and the reason for that

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.540
is very simple we want to keep the

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.260
yarrow rune for later so the black rune

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.450
is much much much more likely to be

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.320
useful right now that was a tight dodge

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.180
I'm happy we made it work think with two

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.280
keys I'm feeling a little lucky I could

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.440
afford to go play this shop

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.060
makes you larger hoping that it's the

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.620
special shop you know the one with the

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.180
two lucky pennies on it it's not but it

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.680
would have been nice if that were the

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.750
case either way one key down not really

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.700
a big ask and it's a small floor so I'm

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.750
going to just get my d6 charged up which

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.070
is going to happen on this room then

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.330
we're going to figure out just where the

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:08.600
heck we need to go after that points for

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.600
now

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.900
kill them Oh petrified poop thank you

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.180
yeah we should be shooting all this

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.830
because petrified poop especially on an

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.210
early floor they can give us like five

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.770
or six cents per floor not to mention

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:28.230
those excellent spirit hearts here by

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.419
the way mr. Megas lovely don't take that

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.419
as an insult to you personally mr. mega

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.440
I think you're the bee's knees

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:36.620
unfortunately we need more than the

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.360
bee's knees we need the business and

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.010
sach dagger is going to give the enemies

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.440
the business I think that's important

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.430
why don't we say give the business as if

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.810
it's a bad thing

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.800
oh so I'm going to give them the

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:52.140
business that would be good if I if I

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.700
please give me your business I would

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.000
would like to have your business improve

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.160
via my consistency that I deserve it and

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.960
appreciate it

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.479
don't punch me in the face I know that's

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.520
what the business means I'm just saying

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:10.140
I'm calling into question the

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:12.419
reliability of that is a as a phrase

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:17.430
needle and being pedantic it's an NL SS

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:21.330
original you know what all it does suck

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.680
up their goods so my expectation there

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.330
is that that wouldn't have done that

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.770
I could have rear old Butterbean but I

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.600
wanted to save the re-roll for the deal

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.070
with the devil and then you know get

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.010
some value out of black room before we

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.650
left the floor for good it's another

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:37.800
reroll opportunity deaths touch is great

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:44.760
reroll shot speed is not bad I guess but

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:49.680
it's also not good at all really it's

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:54.030
not that mean it's nice as a super

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.020
fringe like it's super fringy we needed

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.100
you know if you get a blue cap or

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.960
something like that later on we're gonna

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.170
be like thank God we got this but

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:04.560
without the blue cap a little bit less

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.150
relevant just thrown a little Hail Mary

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.860
out here I'll throw half a spirit heart

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.140
of the problem and see if a sticks it

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:14.070
didn't stick but we're still loving life

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.080
here 9.33 damage rate of fire is pretty

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.700
bad but room to grow and we got deal

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.630
with the devil precedent petrified poop

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.220
came through in the clutch

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.920
and you know what to be honest with you

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.240
one of the big things about picking up

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.090
debts touched there despite the fact

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:32.370
that our rate of fire is garbage is I do

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:35.720
not have to crash into enemies with sack

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:38.700
dagger now that doesn't mean I won't

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.680
however I probably never needed to crash

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.210
an enemies with sack dagger because we

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:48.480
got magic mushroom like the first floor

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:52.140
but I felt like I needed to we can do

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.940
this that was not the right way to go

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.980
but we got a free play out of it that

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.690
way it was still very much not the right

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.230
way to handle it but all right so we're

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:03.510
looking for Guppies head if we could

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.450
somehow get a battery charge on this

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.640
floor did hematemesis was very good

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:12.180
they're not on this floor literally

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.100
within this room that would be sick we

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.080
also just found our secret room for free

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.120
but a great personal risk it was like

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.560
I'm very mr. Magoo Johnny English sort

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:25.290
of moment in there like I'm just going

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.300
to get this charged right now but tell

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.480
you what just so we don't forget will do

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:32.160
then go ahead we haven't gone in this

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.300
room yet it's ten bombs we could reroll

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.250
it but we definitely want to reroll

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.170
guppies head first so think we are going

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:41.760
to take ten bombs and suggest that ten

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:43.050
bombs is actually pretty good yeah would

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.580
take oh dude

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.580
great temperance card

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:52.180
but we will take child's heart with us

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:56.020
if we end up getting a decent amount of

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:58.870
money this is uh oh that was really bad

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.880
a good opportunity for us to hopefully

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.620
replenish our HP and then use it to play

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.740
a blood bank and at this point we don't

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:09.220
need blood bag IV bag though is valuable

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.320
as a reroll pedestal and kind of a

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.350
recreate able reroll pedestal in some

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.240
situations as well so think you come

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:19.300
back here and you hope that this rerolls

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.250
into a good item and it did I would love

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.220
to I mean because I'm an idiot sometimes

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.720
with valuations in this game I would

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.310
love to be the guy who says seraphim's

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.330
not worth it and then you know reroll

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.840
because you never know if you're going

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.280
to snag another for real you never know

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.330
if you're gonna snag another guppy item

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.520
out of it or something like that but

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.520
seraphim is good enough to not pass up

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:47.170
special shop I want those luck upgrades

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.210
I also want pictures on my desk of

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:52.270
Spider Man instead that's not a very

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.710
good Jay jonah Jameson impression why

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:58.090
does every impression end up being bad

00:11:53.710 --> 00:12:00.100
Bernie Sanders I don't know why I wish I

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.450
could do a good Bernie Sanders but if

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:06.130
it's not great it just runs the risk of

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:10.620
coming across as kind of offensive and I

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:13.390
don't mean it in that way plus all of my

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:16.420
Bernie Sanders impression fodder is

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:18.310
based on caricatures is not necessarily

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.900
antithetical to the spirit of comedy I

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:24.880
feel but I don't really have anything

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:26.680
more concrete to base it on I just

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.270
wanted like a him ordering a sandwich at

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:35.320
a subway I think all ingredients should

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:39.520
have equal representation on my Italian

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.500
BMT what that's actually just Barry

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.180
Sanders after he does the fusion Barry

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.680
Sanders Bernie Sanders after he does the

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.080
fusion dance with my Barack Obama

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.170
impression which is equally terrible

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:56.410
grab that let's go okay huge rate of

00:12:53.170 --> 00:13:00.040
fire increase this run is not quite set

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:02.690
because our HP is pretty bad but we

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:06.020
we don't have a long way to go before it

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:08.270
really hits like unkillable status which

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.860
straight-up we deserve sometimes I feel

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.770
bad about having a lot of good runs in a

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.540
row and admittedly some of the bad roles

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.250
that we've had I shouldn't have done it

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.930
some of the bit well now actually worked

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.220
out completely fine but some of the bad

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.020
roles we've had on characters have

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.390
turned into our strongest runs recently

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.490
like that lost run was crazy strong and

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.500
the keeper run was pretty strong as well

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:31.340
although those can go off the rails in a

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:33.650
heartbeat right so that being said

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.740
whenever you roll the keeper that gives

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:40.090
you a few runs absolution of not feeling

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:42.140
bad about getting great quality items

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:44.000
especially getting keeper and lost

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.010
back-to-back it just magnifies that

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.740
impact I'm going to take this I like

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.510
spun I'm going to take that I like guppy

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.530
we're not quite at either of them but

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.690
those are the two valuable

00:13:51.530 --> 00:14:01.070
transformations in the game we're most

00:13:53.690 --> 00:14:03.050
likely to get and we actually wouldn't

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.670
say against all odds but we were pretty

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.800
slow coming out of that second floor and

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:12.020
yet here we are on pace to have a good

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.460
chance to get boss rush using sac dagger

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.330
effectively without getting ourselves

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:19.820
killed as a result it feels nice

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:21.770
god I'm drowsy mom transformation fodder

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.620
gets rear old into secret room

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:28.010
guarantees the guy I'm going to do a

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:31.040
little bit of exploration if we could

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.340
snag that's probably a second secret

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.800
room up here right no if we could snag

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:41.030
another HP upgrade via you know myriad

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.350
opportunities I would welcome it did we

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.520
come down here with enough we couldn't

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.440
have come down here with enough money to

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.890
get an arcade so instead we're actually

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:53.780
going to book it secret room

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:57.020
no just lost my mind there it's like

00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:01.840
it's so 100 percent guarantee apparently

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.840
not it's not worth it

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.130
this is a big moment though are you a

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.440
wizard like I said huge moment

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:10.990
definitely want to go play that again to

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.580
see if we can get the second are you a

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:17.170
wizard pill without putting ourself a

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:20.050
great risk how's this one are you a

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.480
wizard trolls you if you take - are you

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.100
a wizards it actually gives you homing

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:30.220
tears but you've got to take them within

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:32.500
the time period of the first one still

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.420
being active because the first one was

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.340
like are you a wizard and it's a joke

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.330
the second one is like a whole holy crap

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:42.970
he's a wizard but I guess that would

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.520
ruin the pretty sweet joke of are you a

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.500
wizard which is that it's sorta makes

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.510
your shots as if they were being shot by

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.390
that guy from that internet meme picture

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:55.290
so I don't want to ruin the humor

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:58.390
implicit in that for the sake of a

00:15:55.290 --> 00:16:00.550
potentially functional game mechanic or

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.350
anything like that we should shoot this

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.170
poop we could use another spear a tard

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.520
gain access to the secret room and oh

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.800
sorry the curse room and use that curse

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.140
room as a springboard for another guppy

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.320
item and then Bob's your uncle we've

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.550
constructed you know the most common

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.680
archetype for an Isaac win in history

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:21.820
good damage plus guppy but dude

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.800
sometimes you got to order the number

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.710
one when you go to a restaurant you know

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.430
that's what Isaac's famous for I'm

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.520
all-in

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:32.730
that was pretty bad though reroll decks

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:36.700
we've already got something very similar

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:40.060
we will take the dog tooth mild mild

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.200
damage upgrade in fact we shouldn't have

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.030
taken the dog tooth now that I think

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:49.290
about it we already have the x-ray

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:52.840
goggles so the dog tooth is kind of

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:55.660
obsolete the damage upgrade is just not

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:58.960
worth the the opportunity cost of taking

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:01.450
it that early I think but it also just

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.800
doesn't really matter that much that we

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:10.090
did that so BFF is pretty good this is

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.220
great though IV bag so I think we want

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:14.860
money so we're going to go like that

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:19.030
there's two cents that takes us to 15

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:22.689
since BFF is a great item so let's take

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:29.020
that reroll this skeleton key kind of

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:32.140
irrelevant but also sick 99 keys by the

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:34.059
spirit hard good stuff grab this go to

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.990
your deal with the devil if you don't

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:37.390
get a deal with the devil

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.320
after the bow fallen fallen masculine if

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.170
you don't get a deal with the devil

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.090
after your boss fight I think we've got

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.799
the time to go to this curse room and

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:50.440
it'll cost us our ninth life who cares

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:52.120
very very very small risk especially

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.340
considering our ninth life is terrible

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.040
right now at least in terms of its HP

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.200
cat-o'-nine-tails is lovely copy copy

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.780
copy

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:06.240
balls of steel balls of steel infested

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:09.910
and crystal maiden crystal Maiden I'm

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:13.179
singing race sipes DOTA song now dota 2

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.640
dota 2 templar assassin templar said

00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:16.960
okay you get the idea

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:20.679
gonna have a half a red heart when we

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.620
leave here it's not good because we

00:18:20.679 --> 00:18:25.720
could get to a full red heart probably

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.730
but we might also be guppy and we might

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.110
get some demon hearts on here so we're

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.720
in a better situation than originally

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:34.059
thought let's get a move on eleven

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.220
damage 9 rate of fire 2 speed good d6

00:18:34.059 --> 00:18:39.929
tear effects are fine piercing shots in

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:42.490
particular is great yeah we can't really

00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:46.090
be too offended the quality of this run

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:47.669
right now obviously like it's in a great

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.510
spot especially considering were one

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:52.000
item away from two different

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:55.470
transformations that would be incredible

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.580
right now plus BFF sac dagger like I

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.770
kind of just glossed over the fact that

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.110
we got that but as you can see it kills

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.809
some bosses before they even get a

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.429
chance to do their first attack so it

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:10.090
does put us at risk of accidentally

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:13.090
walking into them but if we can okay we

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:16.290
can avoid that most enemies are going to

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.290
eat it pretty quickly here

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.970
self-sacrifice room we we might have

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.830
enough HP to make a self-sacrifice room

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:31.370
work but the desire is not really there

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.840
are you a wizard classics your house was

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:38.150
so funny last time I took that pill I

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.830
fell off my dinosaur it's a bed you know

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.830
what deserve a bit of damage I was being

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:46.610
overly Petty there at the are you a

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:48.380
wizard joke it's just like does doesn't

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:51.410
add to the mechanical nature the game

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.200
and as a result the 45 year old man that

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:56.630
represents my inner child is offended no

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.880
take the steam sale like it's a bit of a

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.970
toss-up but I take the Steam sale as a

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.160
little extra incentive to possibly go to

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.830
the hush fight we are going to require a

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.570
little bit more HP until either before I

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:12.260
feel like that's a great decision

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.830
taro cloth is a wonderful item when we

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.950
get here

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:23.270
we got taro cloth the aro cloth that's a

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:25.340
great situation so we use that yara on

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.800
the chest presumably at least where the

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.280
heck is our item room is very slightly

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:38.590
further behind us

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:38.590
kind of like the Year 2015 check it out

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.850
was there any reason to do that yeah

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:47.570
there was you know what keeping your

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:49.490
skills sharp practice it's important you

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.770
know allen iverson kept saying we're

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.390
talking about practice i thought wait

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.620
that's not even a self-sacrifice room

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.350
that's just a room with spikes that

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.730
looks like a self sacrifice room

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:03.190
that's wild we don't need this we don't

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.190
need this we also do not need that

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.200
sir we don't have time for that I was

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.559
like is there a battery charge in there

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.470
doesn't seem like it Allen Iverson said

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:20.020
we're talking about practice not a game

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:22.620
not a game of this game that I that I

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:26.140
bleed for but practice

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:28.870
yeah well Allen Iverson a manly Guinea

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:33.070
nor anymore you know who is I mean he

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:34.390
isn't in the league any nor either way I

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.760
was going to make a joke about command &amp;

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:40.720
Conquer but then I realized that's not

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.010
hand of not not nor or nor nor really

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.660
rad okay I'm getting caught in a

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.270
linguistic trap that I can't get out of

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:50.290
like the third single off of u2's

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:52.510
comeback album from the year 2000 check

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:56.190
it if it's Krampus Krampus is not

00:21:52.510 --> 00:22:02.770
thankfully but if it were that's fine um

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:03.250
sure let's go for invincibility with one

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.080
luck

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.480
I think that's acceptable you certainly

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:12.580
want the Polaroid what's boss rush Oh

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:15.130
baby I love your way the mind is really

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:18.190
good epic foetus is fine like it's it's

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:21.280
actually a great item most of the time I

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:25.230
don't find it that fun so it's not the

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:28.980
this is I really like to deflect

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:33.820
unwarranted praise when when warranted

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:37.750
weirdly enough I don't think I'm

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:40.299
avoiding epic fetus because wow he's

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.559
such a noble you know Isaac player he

00:22:40.299 --> 00:22:46.410
doesn't want to make his life too easy

00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:46.410
it's not the case at all the cases

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.870
epic foetus is sort of unfun if we're

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:58.390
already in a winning position it's it's

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.790
unfun if you already have a good run if

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.140
we were up against it right now I'd take

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:08.080
it in a heartbeat I wouldn't question

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:11.230
that whatsoever the other thing is it

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:16.680
really doesn't matter if we die on this

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:18.610
boss fight right now is it oh there is a

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:23.350
whatever this thing is called the

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:26.110
Forsaken champion forsaken probably like

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:34.120
80% of the time I fight this guy it's on

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:35.590
boss rush I'm not even sure if he exists

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:45.390
outside of boss rush it's like Michael

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:47.680
Buble and Christmas albums got him okay

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.300
that's not an insult you know if I could

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:56.380
be the king of Christmas music I'd be

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:58.090
fine with that brings joy to many

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.870
people's households during an important

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:04.230
time of the year you know nothing wrong

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.230
with that

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:14.100
dude sack dagger is still like by far

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.830
our best damage dealer if you can

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.360
position yourself properly you're like a

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:21.030
spanish bullfighter or something like

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.830
that going you know Toro carry and Queen

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.390
except nobody feels bad about it because

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.190
instead of being you know borderline

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.890
animal cruelty but also at the same time

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:32.060
a you know cultural tradition so as a

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:34.950
result it becomes a prickly subject

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:37.320
instead it just makes you look sweet cuz

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:40.260
everyone's like good kill that weird

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:44.120
little gross worm that drops red poops

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.120
and doesn't afraid of anything you know

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:52.500
you will never ever get this so we got

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:57.510
our spirit heart back which I thought

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:59.190
was pretty important it was close if we

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.780
could choose what item we get at this

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:04.710
point I would really like to get the

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:06.450
ability to fly I think just a little bit

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.500
of added mobility could tie this whole

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.970
run together we're going to win

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:17.610
basically 100% certainty regardless I'll

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:22.620
take stigmata that's it's decent um I'll

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:23.910
take but the ability to fly would just

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.500
leave us that much more head and

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:30.930
shoulders above the competition right

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:32.340
now I think the more Isaac I play and

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.660
we're really approaching absurdity for

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.210
that statement but I think the more

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.490
Isaac I play the more those enemies are

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:40.830
among my least favorite they're hard to

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:42.390
kill with orbitals they can hit you

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.400
because of their speed before you can

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:47.010
hit them even if your damage is really

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.440
good if your damage is amazing nothing

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.880
stopping you but I think I probably once

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.560
we get down to this floor I most

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.750
consistently take damage against those

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.760
vaginal silk worms especially if there

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:59.250
are bombs because then you can't even

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:03.510
crash into them not that that stops me

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:08.040
on a regular basis but okay 33 percent

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:12.360
deal with devil 100% concentrated force

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:14.780
of will one of the best cards in eternal

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.780
masters

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:21.880
Wow I thought for sure he'd be dusted my

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.450
own fault but I thought for sure he'd be

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:29.680
dust what do we got speed pheromones

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:33.670
hematemesis lemonparty one makes you

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:36.520
larger take Kiera he's gonna to be

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:39.280
honest you take a lot to get me to get

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.720
rid of this yarrow rune right now it's

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:45.460
going to take much more than a one makes

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:50.350
you larger pill speed upgrade not a

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:52.900
speed upgrade no spirit hearts I'd like

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:55.480
to take I mean I have many things I'd

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:59.800
like to buy the world a coke for one but

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:02.530
I'd also like to Cameron Bodi says in

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:05.590
the Smash Mouth song in why can't we be

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:12.670
friends say I'd like to buy the world a

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:14.860
toke I can't remember should go back and

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:17.020
listen to that album how many times have

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.520
I told that Smash Mouth story all-star

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.190
was a big song I mean it's a big song

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:24.700
now for whatever reason it was a big

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:28.660
song when I was in like sixth grade she

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:31.840
said hey MA for Christmas I would really

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:35.070
like the Smash Mouth album with all-star

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:39.160
on it get out of here

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:41.920
didn't work out um she says sure son no

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:45.760
problem was no malicious intent she's a

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:48.970
lovely woman as I'm sure you would infer

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.070
based on the lovely son that you know it

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:54.070
contains 50% of her DNA and was also

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.840
reared by her another thing we want them

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:58.450
bulb dim bulb is a cool trinket I'm

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.730
actually a little sad that I don't think

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.290
dim bulb has a place on this run child's

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.940
heart doesn't really either consider we

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.040
only have one HP but we're gonna be

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:09.280
holding full these six charges a lot of

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:13.990
the time it's just not the right item to

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:19.000
work with here no not really very useful

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:21.460
their Christmas comes you know open up

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.930
the CD it's clearly shaped like a CD

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.760
pretty sure it's either going to be

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:27.460
Ricky Martin's self-titled debut in the

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.230
West Wild Wild West

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:33.700
soundtrack just joking already own that

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:35.289
or smash mouths 1999 album album Astro

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.200
lounge instead I open it up it's Smash

00:28:35.289 --> 00:28:42.730
Mouth the album is called something you

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:44.260
know edgy like foo show Hmong or

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.700
something like that I know that sounds

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.070
like I'm being offensive but it really

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.870
is called something like that it's

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.899
called like fudge you man but like a

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.880
written weird now I'll give him some

00:28:52.899 --> 00:28:57.130
credit it may not have contained all

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.200
star which was basically the only reason

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:01.059
I wanted it in the first place however

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:07.240
what are you used by the single on

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:08.950
iTunes pack you might you hole you

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.870
making me mad we're gonna die here

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:12.669
but that's good for runnin baby

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:15.120
considering we had the same amount of HP

00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:20.440
then as we do now

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:24.370
but it did have walking on the Sun it's

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:26.649
an okay song it actually is probably a

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.260
better song than all star if you if you

00:29:26.649 --> 00:29:32.190
don't let yourself be blinded by Shrek

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.659
and internet memes in the modern era I

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:38.020
think walk I mean they're both pretty

00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:40.120
bad in my opinion and I know some of you

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.850
are smiling along and going yeah pretty

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.679
bad I get it no I don't like the song

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.450
all-star is it part of it is because

00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:50.140
it's become ironically overplayed but

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:51.940
also I understand that you know many

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.880
people are weary of nostalgia so instead

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.809
they've just mastered as irony I don't

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.039
know where I'm going with this is

00:29:55.809 --> 00:30:01.750
getting a little too pretentious even

00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:03.159
for me a dark bum please because then

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.799
you can listen to all-star and be like

00:30:03.159 --> 00:30:07.480
hey Dae all-star mean but really as

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:10.090
you're listening to it something in your

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:14.260
brain on a primal level is going things

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:17.460
are so much better back then back in

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:21.240
fifth grade man the world was so simple

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:23.590
what about iran-contra what about contra

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:26.620
great game series they don't make games

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.480
like that anymore well they do but then

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.309
they come out on Steam and we don't play

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.890
them instead we go all these indie devs

00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:35.250
with their a big pixel art like why

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.460
don't you learn how to make a 3d model

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.029
yeah

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.029
idiots

00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:45.429
it ain't no joke I'd like to teach the

00:30:43.179 --> 00:30:46.240
world the code that you can use and

00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:49.090
contrast

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:52.330
title screen the get in infinite lives

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:55.029
and then you try to find the Rams but

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:57.159
it's not easy because the song goes

00:30:55.029 --> 00:31:03.760
pretty fastest there's a Smash Mouth

00:30:57.159 --> 00:31:06.130
song from foosh your mom see you'll see

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.890
it yourself go look up the album before

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.960
you get mad at me saying something that

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:14.470
sounds offensive go look up the album

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:18.820
title okay I might be off by a little

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:20.799
but I don't think I'm off by a lot it's

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:24.340
like Alan Jackson said man a lot about

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:26.110
living and a little about love thank you

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.590
for these spirit hearts by the way all

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:31.179
good I'm excited and I just can hide it

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:36.700
anyway that was my Smash Mouth story the

00:31:31.179 --> 00:31:39.700
punch line has already passed wonder how

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.850
quickly we can dust him I really thought

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:47.529
we might be able to do it before he even

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:50.320
did his first attack there let's go it's

00:31:47.529 --> 00:31:52.299
going to be an easy run but you know

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.649
what we as far as I'm concerned deserved

00:31:52.299 --> 00:31:56.020
it after some of the runs we've had

00:31:53.649 --> 00:32:00.610
recently okay okay I'm trying to take

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:02.380
inventory first I really would have

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.120
wanted to reroll that one um we're not

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.059
going to lose our spirit or sorry our

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.549
red hearts in all likelihood so I think

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:11.380
we should take SMB super fan I think we

00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:13.899
should take blood of the martyr for

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.610
damage I think we should use Satanic

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:16.870
Bible once and then the rest of these

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:20.590
items are getting parceled out for

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:24.669
rerolls sure the body is okay but I

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:26.710
don't think we needed ok Capricorn you

00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:29.799
definitely take probably multi

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.450
dimensional baby as well blue baby's

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:33.880
only friend the strike took the body by

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.350
accident the straw is great as well

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.940
don't get me wrong we're never going to

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:39.130
use Judas as shadow with six six

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.779
existing lives so I think you use Data

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:44.200
Miner once to make yourself throw up

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:46.270
we got a range down lock up see greatest

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.100
item in the game we roll all these then

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.870
you get a little Jacob's Ladder that's

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:52.310
lovely

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:55.130
some of these other items are okay we

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.860
just don't need them and I'm wary that

00:32:55.130 --> 00:33:01.490
maybe jacob's ladder' plus bombs might

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:05.900
lead to no Jacob's Ladder and Jacob's

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:09.440
Ladder is a lot better than than bombs

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:12.950
for many reasons it's more novel I'm not

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.290
ashamed to admit it but it's also just I

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:17.300
think more damaged at this point now

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:27.290
bombs might still give us Jacob's Ladder

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:29.690
I'm admittedly sort of unsure please if

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:32.810
I ever become like a hermit who lives in

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:35.030
a shack next to a swamp somewhere you're

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.940
gonna know that it's because I like to

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:40.040
be social I am believe it or not and Eve

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.380
I believe this given that I'd sit in my

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.300
room and play video games all day but I

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.400
am an introvert but I'm one of that I

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.380
you know I don't necessarily fit the

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.510
designation of like I never liked to

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:54.110
talk to people I do like to be social

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:56.060
and I think I do okay in social

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:57.980
situations as well but you know there

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.290
are times where you know I order

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.270
something at a restaurant or like a

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.080
drink or something it never comes okay

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.360
it's like why don't you talk to the

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.920
waitress and oh my god I don't really

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.600
want to cuz I don't want her to feel bad

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.460
about herself you know as long as it's

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.470
not on the bill I'll just take it as the

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.960
cost of doing business that's not a good

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:17.450
attitude you should have the courage to

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.950
say hey I ordered this you repeated it

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.090
to me I said yes that's correct and then

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:22.090
it hasn't arrived what gives

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:28.490
but the Skype socializing this is not

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.830
even the normal Skype group is too much

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:32.570
and it says it's weirdly inopportune

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.950
times but anyway we finished our episode

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.780
here thanks for watching hope you

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.920

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.090
of hoping we face a little bit more

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.900
strife at least like glass cannon style

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.800
