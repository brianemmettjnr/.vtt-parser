00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.909
everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.799
language bunny classic Edgeworth plus I

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.309
looked at the footage from the last

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.889
episode and apparently it didn't record

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.590
any game sound which is a known bug with

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.949
OBS so I apologize for that here's our

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.940
see today's blue baby mtv our bln - it

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.260
was one of those things where i went

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.949
back and then looked through I was like

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.260
oh my god

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.490
did we did we have no game sound in like

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.779
all of the videos that I've recorded

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.250
recently but it was really just that

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.309
Isaac won so I guess I got lucky and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.680
I'll just you know test or open and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.430
close OBS between like literally every

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.809
single literally every single video that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.090
we ever do but that's inside baseball

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.950
the thing is you know I start using OBS

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.170
to replace the crackle everybody goes

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.520
use OBS is a perfect program nothing

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.170
wrong with it it'll solve your crackle

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
issue then you use OBS and V where

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.010
there's no game sound it's a known issue

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.250
with OBS oh yeah we all knew about that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.070
but you know it's still a perfect

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
program and never meant to do this ooh

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.219
see it might be a Windows 10 thing as

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.049
well I don't know I'm not blaming OBS

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.030
even though it is OBS is problem so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.530
basically I'm saying I am blaming OBS

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.030
but I'm exalting myself of that blame

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.340
and that's making myself look like a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.900
better person in the process come in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.640
here that was a really lucky get I've

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.170
taken a lot of bad damage while I'm

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.810
taking to its of that damage which is a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.000
relative lot for the start of the show

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.619
today so I'm pretty happy that we ended

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.960
up getting a little bit of HP back there

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.030
to kind of absolve myself start back at

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.110
zero here and make a good run I know

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.759
that said well you know what let's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
squander it immediately I know that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.750
Brian McKnight said start back at 1 but

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.670
I prefer to start at 0 because I've been

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.460
you know working with arrays a lot

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.360
there's zero indexed and as a result L

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.430
that Brian McKnight if you do want to of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.979
diamonds not much of a computer program

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.799
and this is where somebody chimes in and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.350
goes actually NL in this language arrays

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.939
are indexed at one and you know what if

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.950
that's the case more power to you I'm

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.780
unaware it's irrelevant for this

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
purposes for the purposes of this joke

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.640
like some our programmer humor stuff

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.039
right there is like Brian McKnight start

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.989
back in one I don't think so then the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.810
for each loop not on my campus anyway

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.370
okay

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.280
let's big floor here little HP big floor

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.900
we're looking for a obviously our item

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.080
room which we have finally found and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.420
we'd like it to just be DPS and they

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.010
pretty much fits the bill or dead I pick

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.580
up here is really really good to work

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.280
with

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540
I can see forever is also nice if we can

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.020
get like an internal heart that would be

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.250
fine

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.590
but to be honest with you I'm not

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.390
worried about our HP COO too much please

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.800
don't be a secret room rate okay good it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.459
wasn't in the location that would have

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:47.560
allowed us to not nice it would have

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.910
allowed us to not go to the curse room

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.360
via the front door so I'm happy about

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.220
that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.920
we also have our second secret room

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.170
which has nothing of value essentially

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.530
blow that up get a read hard what a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.950
waste

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.880
okay let's go for broke here Dead Eye is

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.290
really really really good ups our damage

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.610
to seven as long as we can keep it

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.410
consistent streak going here which is

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.170
working out you know really nicely for

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.390
the time being I think you have to miss

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.700
more than once to get it to lose its

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.250
maximum charger I don't know maybe you

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.600
have to miss and then not have a hit

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.910
within the next little bit to get it

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.040
because I felt like we got a little bit

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.190
of extra tolerance there that otherwise

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.340
wouldn't have been common but that was

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.720
fine and honestly getting an extra fast

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.970
rate of fire is also really good for us

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.530
as well as blue baby I'm mostly not

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.820
worried about stacking up spirit hearts

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.769
right now I'm worried about getting to

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.590
the point that you know offense is the

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.600
best defense obviously that's you know

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.790
largely not true in most sports you end

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.769
up having those teams that are really

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.870
awesome offensively and then they you

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.609
know get to the AFC conference

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.380
championships and just tank 2004 Kansas

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.090
City Chiefs of course who I'm talking

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.040
about that's right Trent Green Tony

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.209
Gonzales increased Holmes I'm subduing

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.209
you you got a problem

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.859
probably only name like I bet I could

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.730
name less than a hundred people who have

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.340
ever been in the NFL and all of them are

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.900
from either cameos in The Longest Yard

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.599
in the waterboy or they were on the 2004

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.139
Kansas City Chiefs aka the team that I

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:30.090
played as in ESPN NFL football rest in

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.490
peace great game taken from us too soon

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.930
that was the one there astray I hesitate

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.970
to even tell this story not because it

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.110
reflects poorly on me necessarily but

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.240
just because it makes me look like an

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.520
idiot those uh ESPN NFL football games

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.500
had a first-person football mode in them

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.479
where you actually played you know you'd

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.560
be like the quarterback but instead of

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.570
seeing everything from a pulled-back

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.639
perspective behind you you'd be playing

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.250
in first-person and it wasn't really the

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.810
most optimal way to play the game but it

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.020
was kind of a cool novelty of the very

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.300
least and there was a fake study that I

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.340
believed was real published around that

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.810
time and it made the rounds on the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.270
internet and somehow found its way to me

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.240
where you know doctors supposedly were

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.590
writing and they were like oh we tested

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.650
you know the first-person football

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.449
feature on all of our patients but it's

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.250
getting really spooky like when they

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.470
take big hits they act as if they've

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.180
gotten real pain and bruises have

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.949
started appearing on their body and I

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.470
have to be honest with you I bought it

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.830
hook line and sinker admittedly I was

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.840
like fifteen old enough to know better

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.860
but still too young to care as Alan

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.389
Jackson said right I don't think we

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.759
really care about a-bomb for a tarot

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.320
card but I might consider it and then

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.139
you know one of my friends who I'm still

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.250
friends with to this day is like he did

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.009
something very classy

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.690
that I remember and I use it to inform

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.250
my my interactions with people to this

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.599
day I was like dude this is pretty

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.340
serious like I don't know this could be

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.919
like psychologically damaging to play it

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.380
and he was like haha yeah good one

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.180
me and the boys had such a laugh over

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.770
your post here that's that's a reference

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.289
to like a Steven Spielberg letter he

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.659
wrote when a producer suggested they do

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.310
something stupid in the movie he ended

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.800
this my friend did exactly the same

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.080
thing to me basically being like he

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.120
interpreted what I said is

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.639
joke and as a result gave me the easiest

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.909
out to be like yeah I was kidding but

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.319
actually in my head I was like nah I

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:30.289
believed it until that moment I can't

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.539
take it I'm sorry I can't take we should

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.150
go to the shop we could use the well we

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.780
could use the everything couldn't we

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.650
let's try this

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.000
I forget the the extra context of that

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.860
Steven Spielberg thing but I believe a

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.180
producer was like you know it's not a

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.210
calling the movie Back to the Future you

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.370
should call it you know marty checks in

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.750
and the producer sent the letter to

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.159
steven spielberg and steven spielberg

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.629
spends it sent a letter back that was

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:55.659
like I don't think Steven Spielberg did

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.280
back to the future but I'm conflating

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:00.560
stories here but something like that

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.270
after maybe for Jurassic Park and Steven

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.800
Spielberg's sent back a letter that was

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.240
like I showed your letter to everybody

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.949
we all had a great laugh thanks for

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.330
keeping thanks for keeping things light

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:12.080
and airy as production gets more

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.819
stressful it's a really really classy

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.560
way to tell someone to go ask themselves

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.300
wouldn't you say it's like you know

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.409
you've suggested something so stupid but

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.689
I'm going to present you with the

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:22.669
easiest out rather than having to get in

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:24.259
a discussion about it does it make

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.759
Steven Spielberg sound like kind of a

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.080
dick I guess it depends whether or not

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.800
you're on Steven Spielberg side in this

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.770
situation there's also like those emails

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.599
from the the Sony thing like a Sony hack

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.669
from like 2014 where like the CEO or the

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:42.949
somebody that worked high up in the film

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.629
department at Sony was like you know

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:46.099
these kids are really into rollerblades

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:49.279
these days we should make a movie we're

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:51.349
like spider-man rollerblades and oh my

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:53.779
god that could have been that could have

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:55.430
been spider-man homecoming as much as

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.409
you know some people love spider-man

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.539
homecoming some people didn't like it at

00:07:57.409 --> 00:08:01.430
all I'm closer to the loving side for

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:04.279
sure I thought it was pretty good at

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.589
least no matter what he does in that

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:08.180
movie he ain't rollerblading around

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:11.990
going like you know how do you do fellow

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:14.719
kids so anyway this is why we need to

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:17.110
seize the means of production and eat

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:17.110
the rich

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.630
I wanted to turn this into like a modern

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.550
version of these Isaak videos they need

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.500
to reinvent themselves as YouTube has

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.880
become more and more political all of a

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.370
sudden the Isaac videos are just going

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.100
to become my platform for introducing

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.050
you all to my belief which is

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.510
anarcho-capitalism that's a joke don't

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:40.090
take offense to that joy wait that's a

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.530
real ideology and I know that's why I

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.190
used it if I just made something up it

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.190
wouldn't have the same punch

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:50.080
can't go anywhere these days of step on

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:52.870
a Twitter it's all like anime avatars

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.000
talking about you know when the

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.050
revolution rises up you know this is

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.190
where your head is going to go is a

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.060
picture of a guillotine they're not

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.610
tweeting it to me they're usually

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.350
tweeting it to you know like the Land

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.910
O'Lakes butter CEO or something like

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.180
that understand it we live in a very

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:11.110
tumultuous times I suppose dark bomb is

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:15.250
like a game saver for us if I had to

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:17.140
describe Twitter to like someone in 2012

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.600
our glitz a really cool place where like

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.190
you know anybody can say anything they

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.130
want to anybody and it's like a lot of

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.380
fun try to describe Twitter in 2017 it's

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.640
like it's a place where anybody can say

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.490
anything to anybody

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:36.010
stay away get lectured about you know

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.570
politics and healthcare all day I have

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.430
to be say the person who tweeted this to

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.500
me is probably watching I'm not trying

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:44.200
to single you out here but I am going to

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.020
use you as a sounding rod to clarify

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.670
what the heck you were talking about I

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.470
paid for HBO Canada to watch Game of

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.090
Thrones I called up my cable provider

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:56.230
because apparently it's the year you

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.610
know 1911 and I said ah excuse me on the

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.350
old-time talkbox

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.030
could I get that HBO package please so

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.970
they gave me the HBO package anyway and

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.230
I tweeted about it and I'd used the meme

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.120
that was like why the heck everything

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.820
got it cost money and I got a tweet from

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.160
somebody that just said must be nice to

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:16.030
be able to legally purchase things and I

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.490
didn't understand how to react I always

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.700
take the assumption I die actually don't

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:25.270
cultivate very much hatred there's

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.770
youtubers out there who who cultivate

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.060
hatred I'm not saying that it's deserve

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.290
it or undeserving but you know if you

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.610
talked about controversial subjects

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.230
you're going to get people to hate you

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.209
about you know sandwich meta so it

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.470
doesn't matter whether whether you're

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:36.310
fighting for the you know right side of

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.180
the wrong side you're always going to

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.310
people that hate you

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.630
I still get people that you know I've

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.010
probably got you know a few hundred

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.680
people muted on Twitter but that's over

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.899
many many years and you know someone

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.070
goes a bald idiot how do you get out of

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:50.050
bed in the morning I'm just like have a

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.970
nice day a muted I'm not getting into

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.990
arguments but anyway I didn't mute this

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.089
person because it's not offensive

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:58.120
necessarily but I just didn't understand

00:10:55.089 --> 00:11:00.190
how to react when they said must be nice

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.709
to be able to legally you know obtain

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.920
contest yeah are they saying it

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:07.600
sincerely because whenever in English is

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.550
the first language whenever we say must

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.980
be nice it's always like a little bit of

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.570
an undertone of you know oh I can't do

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.290
that so you consider yourself lucky

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:19.200
right and then I was like well if it

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:22.000
must be nice like is this person

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.350
pirating content taking a stance on that

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.019
necessarily but are they pirating

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:29.170
content but then trying to make me feel

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:31.230
bad that I paid for it cuz I don't

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:34.810
because that would be ridiculous but I

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:37.329
just I I found myself befuddled I talked

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.350
about the tweet with my wife and I was

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:41.350
like I don't understand where this is

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.940
coming from she's on either maybe he was

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.949
actually sincere maybe they were saying

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.600
oh must be nice to be able to support

00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:49.839
content that you enjoy in which case

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.589
yeah I mean 18 bucks for a

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:52.420
single-channel

00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:53.649
Wow is also as the movie channel so

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.310
that's nice right I've talked about that

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:56.980
already

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.620
oh yeah it feels feels okay doesn't feel

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.110
like you know I'm the Saints or anything

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.370
like that but if I'm misinterpreting

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:06.640
what it would appears to be malice

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:08.949
where's my lucky pen use as our would've

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.480
would appears to be malice has refused

00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:13.120
to be generosity is malice then I

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.550
apologize but for what appears to be

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.839
benevolences anyway the point is I don't

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.279
know what you're talking about but I

00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:20.589
will not be shamed for legally

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.910
purchasing things I'm not bragging oh it

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:25.769
was close I think we could be close to

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.769
death here so just dial in for a second

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.949
I'm going to be shamed for them I don't

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.149
think any realistic person or reasonable

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.560
person would try to shame you for it

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:34.600
either which is why I found myself in

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.010
such a just add Arnold conundrum about

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.550
what the heck was even happening over

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.550
the course of this

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.660
roasted I can't see my HP but I'm really

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:53.359
happy that this guy dropped two red

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:55.100
hearts just one spirit heart it's a

00:12:53.359 --> 00:13:00.499
little bit on the cheap side but I'll

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:02.329
tell you what I'm happy for it

00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:05.059
nonetheless that means like he must be

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:06.619
at most one red heart away from paying

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:08.540
out again whether it be with Spyder

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:10.309
black heart or you know something else

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.859
spider black heart also my favorite

00:13:10.309 --> 00:13:14.359
character in here's the storm I just

00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:15.679
loved his heroic they're not called

00:13:14.359 --> 00:13:17.389
Ulsan heroes of the storm that called

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:19.160
heroics because it's totally different

00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:23.809
it's not a MOBA it's a character based

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:25.730
RPG with leveling let's get out of here

00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:26.929
yeah arcades are meaningless to me at

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.230
this point I almost slipped into like a

00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:33.859
very a very depressed Arnold

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.480
Schwarzenegger there wow we were half a

00:13:33.859 --> 00:13:38.470
spirit out away from death actually oh

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.730
now we're one spirit art away from death

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.829
you know everybody can struggle with

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:45.110
mental health I'm not afraid to admit it

00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:47.419
I don't have to the best of my knowledge

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.279
at least diagnoseable mental health

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:50.839
issues but you know there are days I

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:52.249
don't really want to record videos

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:53.660
Thursday's I don't really want to stream

00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:55.100
I'm like I know I don't really feel good

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.519
today I'd rather just like not do

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.470
anything for me personally what helps is

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:02.029
actually doing stuff and not you know

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.699
giving into the beast I'm not trying to

00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:06.709
say that that's like a cure but I'm sure

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:08.660
that like you know Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:10.189
gets depressed sometimes it's probably a

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.350
little bit you know

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:13.699
uncouth for me to make a character for

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:18.709
depressed Arnold Schwarzenegger like

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:20.929
guys I just feel like everyone is out to

00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:22.249
get me you know that's you can't even do

00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:24.649
the Arnold Schwarzenegger voice when

00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:26.209
he's not angry I think the only way you

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:27.889
could do that character justice is if

00:14:26.209 --> 00:14:30.350
you did like Mitchell and Webb style and

00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:32.059
you mind it for absurd humor first you

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.999
were like hey this this is funny because

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:36.559
it's Arnold Schwarzenegger but he's not

00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:38.299
happy or energetic he's just a little

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:39.859
bit sad today and then at the end you

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:43.369
actually tied in like a good lesson

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:44.730
about mental health you know like he got

00:14:43.369 --> 00:14:47.580
better at the end

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.260
something like that leave you on a good

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.570
note

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.340
Wow I'm mad I'm actually mad

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.560
first off one of the worst dodges I've

00:14:53.340 --> 00:15:00.210
ever seen but still that was pretty poor

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:02.160
on my part and 6g m-28 WJ I think I just

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.570
have to accept that if I ever get an

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.060
orbital it's like the kiss of death for

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:08.280
me lately I'm popping off like

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:10.560
consistent 4 wins 1 loss 4 wins 1 loss

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.290
and it's honestly getting a little

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.850
embarrassing but hopefully the

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.530
commentary is making up for the fact

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.390
that we're you know loading up another

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.190
video to unload explode on Edward

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:24.470
Hawthorne load explode on Edward

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.470
Hawthorne I see you looting

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.940
yes oh I don't think depressed Arnold

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.680
Schwarzenegger is really going to make

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:40.850
it as a character I'm trying I'm trying

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:43.520
but there's got to be something maybe we

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:46.130
can get like a Sylvester Stallone that

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.110
has decided that he's like really into

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.700
knitting or something like that

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.410
he had subverts expectations without

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.050
making anybody the butt of craps

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.930
a joke that's a little off-color nose

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:59.030
Mickey he also is just Rocky permanently

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.620
I used to it I don't never felt more

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.490
alive than when I got those needles in

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.820
my hand Mickey

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.440
he's like a mr. Peter W meat locker all

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.860
over again except instead of a meat

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.010
locker

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.960
I'm able to sweater for people to wear

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.310
in the meat locker see his can you know

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.820
there's a punchline to be worked on

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.820
there somewhere

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.770
Wow just walked right into that one

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.000
but there was that there's a closer for

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.320
the Blue Jays and I don't follow

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.780
baseball but I thought the story was

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.490
really good I was so done really good

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.910
nonetheless he's like I'm not going to

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:40.190
work today because I'm like I have

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.420
anxiety I have an anxiety disorder so

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.770
I'm not going to work today and I was

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:47.090
like that takes a lot of guts you know

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.070
everybody knows that we in the video

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.520
game industry are all sorts of messed up

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.830
you know

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.200
anyone that you can think of this like

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.030
let me put it this way I'm on the normal

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.720
side as a full-time streamer and

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:01.520
youtuber and you hear me rail on about

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.340
sandwiches for like 50 minutes you know

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:07.730
I've got it pretty easy 50 minutes you

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:09.440
know per hour apparently everybody knows

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.480
the world sorts of messed up in our own

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.070
you know weird and wonderful ways but

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.680
for a professional athlete to come out

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.150
and be like you know I feel like I'm in

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.590
prison inside of my own brain I thought

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.410
that was really bold thought that was a

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:23.480
good move and I was also very proud of

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.040
the way that people reacted to it very

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.570
few people were like oh I wish I could

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.550
just take a mental health day off from

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.320
work must be nice to be a profession you

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:33.410
should be able to take health day off

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.820
from work you know there's offices my

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.220
office didn't do this when I worked

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.650
there but it does it now they've phased

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.360
out sick days and they've just made them

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.100
so instead of like you have five six

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.970
days you can take or ten six days you

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.530
can take you just get ten days

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.930
and you don't have to tell anybody what

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.580
it's for so every year you know if you

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.900
don't take it you I don't think you lose

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.800
it but you should take it they

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:57.120
incentivize you being like you know I

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.440
don't feel good today I'm not going to

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.360
come in and it's probably good you know

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.350
I mean maybe less so in baseball because

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.120
it's not like they're going to postpone

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:06.150
the game for you but I bet like you're a

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.830
more you're happier you're more

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.890
productive fitter happier more

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:12.390
productive exactly as a result of that

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.880
I'm glad that there's been kind of like

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.130
a an awakening when it comes to mental

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.360
health now if I could just get people to

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.420
start caring about their physical health

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.190
and washing their dang hands when they

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.920
come out of the bathroom that's the only

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:29.490
thing I ask I see you looting I see you

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.500
at PAX toilets break down every two

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.930
seconds soap canisters are still 80%

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.820
full how does it happen some of y'all

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.230
ain't washing your hands if you're

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.790
sitting here right now you're trying to

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.140
come up with a logical argument not to

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.460
wash your hands well I don't want to

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.990
contribute to the degradation of

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.300
society's ability to fight germs by

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:50.310
washing my hands right no it's not about

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:52.530
you okay I've had this discussion many

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.690
times I've even had these opinions when

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.330
I was a little bit younger but you know

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.280
you wash your hands when you go to the

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.780
bathroom a couple of reasons first off

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.370
make them smell good so they don't smell

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.750
like pee or poop I know you might be

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.850
Santa just don't pee or poop in my hand

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.280
oh yeah this avoids it completely you

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.780
know the same reason like I want the

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.310
person making my sandwich to be wearing

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.720
gloves I don't know what's on his hands

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.240
but just you know these hands are

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.000
probably clean but let's absolve in the

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:21.150
responsibility and necessity right

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.160
second reason is I'm a young healthy you

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.840
know adult male youngish anyway come on

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.750
let me just butter me up a little bit

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.520
here I might come in contact I mean I

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.810
won't because I stay inside almost all

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.870
the time but I might come in contact

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:36.710
with old people people with depressed

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:40.170
immune systems ie sick people

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.430
toddlers you know I it's not just I'm

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.170
gonna try this I probably shouldn't be

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.850
I'm gonna try this it's not just for you

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.100
you know there's a certain herd immunity

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.840
it's like saying you know I'm not going

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.790
to get this vaccine because you know I'd

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.330
rather just get the flu and roll with it

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:56.430
not just for you you know you once you

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.500
have the sickness you're also a carrier

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.730
of the sickness and you could

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.320
in fact other people that's why I

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.330
recommend washing your hands and you

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.280
know who needs to get this message

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.020
you're like oh god please tell me who in

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.790
the NL SS doesn't wash their hands no I

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.930
don't know that if they're not washing

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.370
their hands they're not telling me which

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.380
honestly is a smart decision because I'd

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:16.020
kick them off a show like that till they

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.940
got their dang hands clean so we don't

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.730
change till you get up and wash your

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:23.850
hands buddy we're not going to go any

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:26.010
further than that the entire nation of

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.110
Japan that's right I'm going there I

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.810
mean I'm not going to Japan any time

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:34.800
soon k-tiz but I'm not I've had my fill

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:37.140
for the time being yeah let's do it

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.090
let's recreate this last run any

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.090
Japanese bathroom in a public place

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:45.210
there's like a 95% chance they always

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.410
have a sink and I appreciate that

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.970
because I'm sure the water is better

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.670
than nothing

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:52.080
95 percent chance of no soap I see him

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:56.070
go into Japanese business right as a

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.740
country of 150 million people they go in

00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:00.750
peer pool run a little bit of water on

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.820
their hands splash them against the sink

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:06.710
and then walk out get on a train that

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:10.380
has like 1500 people packed into a car I

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:14.610
don't know if Japan and this is being

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:16.350
sincere do they get mildly sick more

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.510
than a country like the United States

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.310
for example or do they get less sick

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.510
because they tend to be in I'm not

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.770
trying to insult you by the way they

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.480
tend to take care of themselves at least

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:29.580
from a dietary standpoint from a better

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.260
position but like either way they do it

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.420
just it confuses me because it's such a

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.640
sanitary country like when people get

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.100
sick they all wear face masks so you

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.990
don't affect anybody else what what if

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.000
you did the face mask thing which I

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.590
think looks a little silly but I

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.940
understand I think it's admirable from

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.730
like a disease controlling sort of

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.800
standpoint but you also had soap in the

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:52.650
battle I'm not being controversial here

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.630
I think I'm not oh just another example

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.490
of a white guy going into the you know

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.390
some other cultures country and telling

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.010
them how to run their business

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:03.360
I'm just saying washing your hands with

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:05.670
soap of science I love you but just meet

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.530
me halfway here because then that means

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.880
that I don't get to use soap when I wash

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.980
my hands and then I feel like I'm

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.750
responsible like I'm I'm being grow

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:16.830
as a result so I gotta start carrying

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:17.910
around like my own hand sanitizer it's

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.340
one of those things that like I've

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:22.320
talked to other expats and people who

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.770
have spent a lot of time in Japan which

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.140
I would argue that I have not really but

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:29.640
we might lose this one too

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.850
never soap in the bathrooms it's not

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:35.070
like a you know wow Japan so backwards

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.730
I'm more like just put the soap in the

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.010
bathrooms

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:41.160
you guys are doing so many things right

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:43.470
here trains are wonderful so clean

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.760
there's no garbage like anywhere there's

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.390
probably like a lot of garbage somewhere

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.799
but there's no garbage anywhere else but

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.820
just get some soap in the bathroom

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:55.799
that's all I ask

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:57.960
you know it doesn't have to be dug okay

00:22:55.799 --> 00:23:00.150
it's a job creator as well you know

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.880
starting get those soap factories

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.799
running it like 10 times production or

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.590
something like that I'm sure by the way

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:09.720
I'm sure we do some things that when

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.640
Japanese people come to North America

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:16.049
they go oh my god you guys do things so

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:17.100
weird why are their forks at the sushi

00:23:16.049 --> 00:23:21.750
restaurant I don't

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:23.610
this is unfathomable I'm try there's got

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:25.080
to be some examples I always my go-to

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.549
example and I'm going to avoid just

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.630
retreading the same ground over and over

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:31.620
here but is whenever I see a picture of

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.150
barbeque and it's served like nine

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.450
slices of white bread and like that's

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:39.030
just humanity's come to farted to be

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.910
okay with that but then Austin tells me

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:43.860
oh no barbecue places do that and I show

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.540
him picture pictures and victus and he

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.870
goes oh no good barbecue places here

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:51.530
he's taking shots invictus in them slide

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.530
for the cenotes

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:56.930
anyway that's my requisite NL is a bit

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.340
racist fit here I don't think it's

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.990
racist to say that I wish I'm not

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.670
calling them dirty I just wish that they

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.990
had soap in the bathrooms although I

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.000
will say I think I've told this story

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:08.980
once before but it's too glorious not to

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.020
tell again I walked into a bathroom in a

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.870
train station in Japan they have squat

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:16.100
toilets not not every toilet is a squat

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.420
toilet but a lot of toilets of squat

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.640
toilets never seen a squat toilet

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.490
imagine caffeine pill from the binding

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.430
of issac but about the size of you know

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:27.050
like a basketball the height is the size

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:29.270
of a basketball maybe or not the height

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.100
the length and the width is of you know

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:33.710
just to take caffeine pill and then

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.330
stretch you along the y-axis and then

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.620
there's no seat but there's a little bar

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.540
you hang on to and you just kind of drop

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.820
your poop of pee out of your out of your

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.620
bottom and you come up any I don't know

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.300
and Anatomy works but you know you

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.710
Cooper pee into it and well you're just

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.660
kind of crouching over top of it using

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.160
the bar to support you I got no problem

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.710
using those for a number one doesn't

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.750
bother me in the least

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.280
I never going to use it for a number two

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.170
I'd rather hold it if it's like an

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.380
unbelievable emergency I'd try I guess

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.790
but and then everyone always comes in

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.110
and says I've read on the internet once

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.130
that it's better for your colon yeah

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.230
I'll believe it when I hear from a

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.550
doctor never got to my doctor and she

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.580
says oh what kind of toilet do you use

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:12.620
that's your problem right there anyway

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:15.580
one time I walked in and I was faced

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:18.650
with just a bizarre ethical conundrum

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:21.710
rainbow baby because I walked in and

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.900
there was a poop just on the ground and

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:28.520
someone had stepped into it they had

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:31.250
basically done a waffle stop now that by

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.660
itself is okay I've seen some gross

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.270
public bathrooms in my day I've seen

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.160
some weird public bathrooms and PAX West

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.630
on the first floor there's a public

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.880
bathroom that has a huge it's like a

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.900
stall but there's a huge hole cut out of

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.730
the side of it because I guess they have

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:46.430
a problem with people like taking

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.590
intravenous drugs in that bathroom you

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:51.860
know not adpacks but in downtown seattle

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.150
and but this is in the convention center

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.680
I'm just saying like I'm pretty sure

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.450
it's not the PAX attendees passing out

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.590
in their vote for the most part although

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.590
people do get wild sometimes

00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:03.419
that bathrooms weird I would not feel

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.649
comfortable using it it's like literally

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:05.639
there's a window there where you can

00:26:04.649 --> 00:26:07.679
just look at the rest of the bathroom

00:26:05.639 --> 00:26:11.340
you'd have to be in a dire straits to

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:13.559
check that out but see I'm getting

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.000
distracted here there was a poop on the

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:19.169
ground and somebody had waffles stomped

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.450
it here's what I did I went to the

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:22.620
bathroom I peed I got out of there and I

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.419
got out of there as fast as I could

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:27.299
after washing my hands no soap

00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:28.889
unfortunately but I thought to myself

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:30.809
like do I even want to use this bathroom

00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:32.850
like I'm cursed as soon as I step in

00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:34.139
here because the next person if I get

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.059
out of here and there's a person waiting

00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:39.299
to use this bathroom they're going to

00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:40.559
say oh my god that foreigner went into

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:43.139
the bathroom took a poop on the ground

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:45.149
stepped on it and now he's leaving like

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:47.399
I'm going to catch the secondary blame

00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:49.080
for doing this even if I had just walked

00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:51.990
in and then like walked out within two

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.960
seconds I'm the last person who saw that

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.429
bathroom without a big poop on the floor

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.139
according to you know if you'd ask the

00:26:56.429 --> 00:26:59.820
people that have come after me here so I

00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:02.220
am now like the Shepard of that poop so

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:05.009
I did I would I'd never came close to it

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.279
but in my head I was like maybe I should

00:27:05.009 --> 00:27:11.100
clean it up to absolve myself of the

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:12.629
suspicion that it was me and then you

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.120
know there's a clean bathroom back here

00:27:12.629 --> 00:27:16.529
I did not and you know in hindsight it's

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.659
actually just ridiculous

00:27:16.529 --> 00:27:20.129
that I would ever have considered it I

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:21.870
mean after I cleaned it up how am I

00:27:20.129 --> 00:27:25.139
going to wash my hands just with water

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:27.929
oh thanks oh man it doesn't it's not the

00:27:25.139 --> 00:27:31.769
same it doesn't get the oils out so

00:27:27.929 --> 00:27:33.269
anyway that's that's my story Kate told

00:27:31.769 --> 00:27:38.159
me that when she went to Italy and

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:39.659
admittedly this is like probably like 18

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.740
years ago or something like that I'm

00:27:39.659 --> 00:27:42.929
trying to remember I think she told me

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.039
she was like a seven or eight when she

00:27:42.929 --> 00:27:45.750
went she said they were near the

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:47.250
Colosseum I'm not trying to suggest all

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:51.120
of Italy's like this they were near the

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:54.240
Colosseum and people apparently steal

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.639
the toilet paper from the bathroom and

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.940
then they try to sell it to you so that

00:27:56.639 --> 00:28:01.590
you I mean have toilet paper when you go

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.179
poop I would pay 25 cents a sheet for

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.000
toilet paper I'd rather not have to but

00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:08.559
if the if the situation presented itself

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.499
and I absolutely had to I could see it

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:13.389
someone verify whether or not that's a

00:28:11.499 --> 00:28:15.610
true story because if it's a fake story

00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:17.919
then I'm you know she's got some

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:22.240
explaining to do if she's got a real if

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:26.320
it's a real story then like man nip that

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:31.259
in the bud okay you set up like a

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.259
secondary like steam key sales market

00:28:33.629 --> 00:28:39.690
for toilet paper toilet paper they

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.690
didn't even purchase in the first place

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:44.769
I'm not trying to say you know these

00:28:42.809 --> 00:28:46.029
vagabonds shouldn't be allowed to make

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:48.360
some money but that's like you're

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:51.249
creating an artificial scarcity there

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.049
plus you're compromising you're just

00:28:51.249 --> 00:28:54.850
creating more work for the laundry at

00:28:53.049 --> 00:28:56.499
that point because you know there's

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.840
going to be I've been on vacation with

00:28:56.499 --> 00:29:00.639
dad's dad's of all stars and stripes

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.830
there's going to be one dad eventually

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:04.179
who's like you know I'd really like the

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.470
toilet paper but I'm not going to pay

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:07.600
for it I'm not going to buy into your

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.860
racket you know dads are stubborn like

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.809
that he's going to pull up his pants

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.320
with it with half a deuce still smeared

00:29:10.809 --> 00:29:17.340
on the o-ring and you know ruin a

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.340
perfectly good pair of chinos

00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:22.700
and I don't stand by that because when

00:29:20.899 --> 00:29:25.760
dads are on vacation dads should be able

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:28.370
to let loose they've been working all

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.010
year at the paper Factory just so my

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.539
wife wants to go to Italy I can't wait

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.130
to go to Italy so these found to be this

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:36.289
freaking Paper Factory plus I get to

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.850
make memories of my family and it's

00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:38.990
going to be an enjoyable time and then

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.120
all of a sudden you know some guys

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:43.159
trying to grip them in the toilet paper

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.529
game I was born at night but not last

00:29:43.159 --> 00:29:47.809
night good serve I don't even know what

00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:51.409
I'm talking about anymore this is our

00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:53.149
first fight against Gish if I'm being

00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:54.740
100% honest and I've said this about a

00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:56.659
few runs recently you might start to

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.720
think this is like the NL who cried wolf

00:29:56.659 --> 00:30:02.330
I think that this run is pretty bad

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.830
halos good pacifier is good I mean just

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:07.159
in general let's put a blanket term

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:08.899
there our rate of fire is great dark

00:30:07.159 --> 00:30:11.840
bomb is also good although we can't seem

00:30:08.899 --> 00:30:13.820
to get a luck upgrade we're going to get

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.230
a little Gish here which is not very

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:18.289
relevant to be honest with you and our

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:21.140
damage is pretty bad I mean it is 7.13

00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:25.460
but that's because we use the devil card

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:28.940
here okay to spirit ours is a big take

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:31.100
up and crystal the tower is garbage I

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.390
don't think I've I think I have taking

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.220
Chris to the tower once on this save

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.210
file I thought I took it on a run where

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.860
I was like we might as well take it

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:39.409
we're going to win anyway which is the

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.919
right approach to take for that item

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:46.520
that was just terrible okay okay so what

00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:51.620
are we leveraging here to try to make a

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:53.419
bad run a little better well we have a

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.740
decent number of bombs and a decent

00:30:53.419 --> 00:30:56.659
number of keys so if we can leverage

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.520
those to pick up more consumables than

00:30:56.659 --> 00:31:00.620
maybe could lead to something good from

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.940
the shop also being able to dodge for

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:07.760
like the first time in my adult life

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:11.539
might be nice chemical peel is an okay

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:14.360
damage of now half of our shots are

00:31:11.539 --> 00:31:15.770
going to deal like eight damage now

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.210
eight point eight point six damage

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:21.470
that's not bad not quite dead shot but

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:24.919
we're still alive so that you know we

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.600
have a leg up in that area hmm we're

00:31:24.919 --> 00:31:31.789
about to leave the tank that's one as

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:33.139
well I think I can't I thought about it

00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:35.029
but I can't bring myself to bomb our

00:31:33.139 --> 00:31:40.639
donation machine I just don't think it's

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:41.899
like I wouldn't feel right about it

00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:46.070
because our donation machine is our

00:31:41.899 --> 00:31:47.840
friend and then you don't blow up your

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:52.100
friend just to get a couple of pennies

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.630
you know if I can give you one lesson

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.740
today it's first off apparently if

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.690
you're going to Japan and you care about

00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:01.039
cleanliness of your hands bring your own

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:03.860
soap secondly I'm just I want you to be

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:06.230
clean it's not I'm saying I'm not the

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:10.190
cleanest man in the world I'm relatively

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:12.770
clean but you know there are times I've

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:15.620
been blessed or cursed with the you know

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.850
too much free testosterone or something

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.590
I don't know the genetics behind it but

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.440
I you know I went bald when I was like

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:23.659
19 I'm 28 years old I have ear hair

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.580
don't cry for me you know life's still

00:32:23.659 --> 00:32:27.049
pretty good but it is a little bit on

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.840
the ridiculous side wouldn't you say

00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:31.760
sometimes I come back inside after a

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.559
whole day of being outside and kael be

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.529
like man your ear hair is like growing

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:37.909
out of control and am i all good I was

00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:39.760
out there thinking that I looked

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:43.880
respectable but it actually I look like

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:46.159
you know the weird dude from Star Wars

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.220
or Star Trek Voyager you know which one

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:50.570
I'm talking about maybe he's from Deep

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.630
Space 9 I don't know he kind of looks

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:55.520
like a hobbit but he's big he's like

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.760
bigger than a hobbit is bigger than a

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.760
breadbox

00:32:58.679 --> 00:33:03.690
right I maintain a certain like I shower

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.220
every day wash my hands after I go to

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.480
the bathroom every once in a while I

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.059
could give myself a little stink check

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.380
you know you go okay we're still holding

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:14.370
up here it's like checking the oil in

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:16.620
your car people go I don't stink yeah

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:19.260
but wouldn't you rather check when you

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.960
rather just know like I've been to some

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.059
Friday night magic I believe it for me

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:27.659
or did you believe it or not take it

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:28.650
from me I'm not insulting everybody that

00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:30.870
goes to Friday night magic

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:33.510
I am just saying that by and large

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:35.250
there's a certain the the overall

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:38.549
average cleanliness of the room is lower

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:40.110
than I like sometimes so you need a lot

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:41.549
of people there probably like why would

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.140
I need to shower I don't smell bad just

00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:44.399
telling you just a general rule there's

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.049
days when I'm like that I'm like I don't

00:33:44.399 --> 00:33:49.679
need to shower today shower anyway build

00:33:46.049 --> 00:33:51.600
a habit I don't think people need this

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:53.460
lesson for the most part many of you

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.520
probably have your your lives more in

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.049
order than me does I meet people that

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.000
you know I had conventions and stuff

00:33:58.049 --> 00:34:00.990
they're like oh I love your videos I

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.990
like cool what do you do and they're

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:07.740
armed you know CEO at Facebook that's

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:09.119
right Mark Zuckerberg Marty suck as I

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.919
call him I like to call him that because

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:12.929
it gets his name wrong and thus gives me

00:34:10.919 --> 00:34:14.399
social value over him because he's a big

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:16.830
fan and I'm making him feel like garbage

00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:19.349
so that's like a really that's pretty

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:23.099
much my central ethos uh we can afford

00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:24.929
to fight this guy why not right no I've

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:28.429
never met Mark Zuckerberg but I do meet

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:31.560
people there's there's a little irony

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:33.179
one time I thought I was being clever

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.149
this was like five years ago as a

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:38.669
younger NL I've grown a matured a lot

00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:41.970
through through the years as most people

00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:43.440
I want to do I believe I met him at at a

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:45.690
pax and if you're watching this you

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.609
probably at this point think that I'm

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.690
just a total dick and have stopped

00:34:47.609 --> 00:34:50.669
watching and you know what this is

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.320
deserve it although it is just an

00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:54.859
offhanded comment anyway the point is

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.660
we're going to stop baiting it here um

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:58.859
he saw me he said like oh hey NL you

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.820
know I'm a big fan and I was like cool

00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:01.650
what are you doing he's like I'm a

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.630
software developer and I said my

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:07.410
condolences which I thought was just

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:09.460
like kind of a pity like you know ha ha

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.930
ha you know that's big you know

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.030
software developers real boring it's

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:15.490
just like office space there's so much

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:16.839
irony in that because now I'm not doing

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.609
it for sad bombs but I did think about

00:35:16.839 --> 00:35:20.470
it now

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:22.359
I love software development for one

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:25.270
software development is really fun it's

00:35:22.359 --> 00:35:26.560
like cold Lego you know you're building

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.640
something but you're not building it

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.300
with your hands you're building with

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.280
your brain

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:32.680
it's really cool he just kind of laughed

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.690
and was like no huh yeah anyway nice to

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.070
meet you I don't think I'm not saying

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.599
the guy thought I was a jerk and I don't

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:39.400
think I necessarily come off too badly

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:41.530
in that story but the other part of that

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.910
story is first off I regret saying it

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:45.670
because in my opinion I was just wrong

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:47.770
but secondly basically if anyone ever

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.869
tells you what they do the worst

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.580
possible reaction that you can have is

00:35:49.869 --> 00:35:53.200
like oh you know that thing that you've

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.330
dedicated your life to and like you know

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.130
1/4 of your waking hours or 1:30 your

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:59.710
waking hours wow what a waste you know

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:01.800
it's just sort of a bad thing to do even

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:04.089
if somebody's like I work at you know I

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.980
clean the bedpans at the hospital if you

00:36:04.089 --> 00:36:07.599
were like well that's a crappy job right

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.339
amazing yeah but maybe it's rewarding

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:11.470
and even if it isn't rewarding even if

00:36:09.339 --> 00:36:14.080
it's even if they hated you know they

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:17.280
don't want to be reminded that it sucks

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:20.290
it's just kind of a jerk move honestly

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.690
that's my this is my apology to that guy

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:24.400
you know there's a long thought we can

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:25.390
make it there it was a long time ago and

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.880
I don't think you took it the wrong way

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:29.080
but every once in a while I do think

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.460
back to that moment like once a month

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.890
I'll be like why did I say my

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:38.680
condolences that's just like it's such a

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:39.820
jerk move headed at this point in my

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.280
life and trying to take a genuine

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.540
interest in you know what people do

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.950
because especially if you like you meet

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.410
someone passionate about what they do

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.820
even if you don't understand it at all

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:50.980
it's cool to talk to them and figure out

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.570
you know what drives them I feel like

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.510
there's a good gisli message in there

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:57.490
he's like the same way like Dan is one

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.800
of the most interested people I've ever

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:04.390
met I think that's why he's so likeable

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:06.190
one of the reasons he's so likeable and

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.810
I didn't misspeak I don't necessarily

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:09.369
mean that Dan is one of the most

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.960
interesting people I've ever met

00:37:09.369 --> 00:37:12.940
although I think that would also fit the

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.890
bill you ever listen to him during play

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.810
around on battlegrounds but anyway I

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:19.480
think one of the most interested people

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.770
I've ever met like he'd he'll get in a

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.660
conversation with you about something

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.200
that he knows nothing about and he

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.030
really

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.710
gives you the idea that he's trying to

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.470
learn more about it you know I think

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:30.670
he's very good socially in that way

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.470
which is in the Big Brother house will

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:36.040
get you killed if you're on the wrong

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:38.619
side of the Gea's you can manipulate the

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.420
masses right but in a personal sort of

00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:43.300
like affable sort of way it's it's

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.700
really nice feel free to tell them I

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:50.589
said that by the way no problem offering

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:57.250
a fellow giving a genuine and sincere

00:37:50.589 --> 00:38:01.869
compliment like that I think it's it's

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:04.359
virtuous now if somebody went up to me

00:38:01.869 --> 00:38:05.530
and they're like oh hey NL how you doing

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:06.430
and I was like oh cool what do you doing

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.470
they're like I run a YouTube channel

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:13.030
called youtube.com slash Mathis games I

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:17.170
would be like all my condolences oh man

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:20.589
yes that anecdote hurts me because it

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:23.079
sort of a reflects badly on me and then

00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:25.150
B also it just it makes you look like

00:38:23.079 --> 00:38:26.500
you're out of touch and I just hate when

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:28.300
I think back to that is like I lose you

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.420
know when you have those stories where I

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.640
told you like you know my high school

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.190
bus driver was like have fun in college

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.750
and I was like yeah you too and I was

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.180
like that accidentally made me look like

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:42.940
a jerk this one kind of like was I was

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:46.300
accidentally being a jerk which is a

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:48.069
step in a different direction oh my god

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.800
are we actually going to be able to do

00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:56.740
something on this run I'm questioning it

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:58.750
but also like hopeful I suppose and

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.910
there's a there's a level of growth

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.440
there you know I hope there's a level of

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.480
growth there as well maybe I don't think

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.940
I've had it's like the only interaction

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.980
I've ever had

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.599
that went wrong and it wasn't even right

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.920
it's not like he said he'd screw you and

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:13.690
then walked away it was very pleasant

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.250
interaction but you know doing the

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:17.140
post-mortem afterwards I was like that

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.760
was not a good interaction it's the only

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.040
one like that I've ever had and I think

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.750
that's a good sign because it's also if

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.710
it's the only one that's gone wrong and

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.060
it was my fault

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.790
that's perfect everybody else has been

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:31.690
doing their jobs you know then been

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:32.870
polite and affable and not weird and

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.220
that's

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.220
it's all it takes you know

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.180
I think anyway I am still a little salty

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.470
that Dan didn't give me that TV he was

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.730
giving away in that sponsored deal

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:50.160
though I really thought I was a shoo-in

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:51.660
I've never heard of the company that was

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.940
giving it away it was probably for

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.850
American residents only and somebody in

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:58.440
the comments is like you know oh my

00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:00.600
boyfriend from overseas like we watch

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.340
all your shows on Big Brother we met on

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.020
Big Brother he proposed to me with a big

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.270
brother themed ring and I was like come

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.010
on Jennifer you're really blowing out

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:11.060
the field for the rest of us like how am

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:11.060
I supposed to compete with that

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:16.619
telling your honest heartfelt story I'm

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.450
just over here trying to get a free TV

00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:20.310
because I got a lot of Twitter followers

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:21.840
and people care about my opinions on

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.850
sandwiches for whatever reason you got

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.500
to you know step in here with this

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:29.220
incredibly heartfelt story about how you

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:32.220
deserve a TV because yo I've gone

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:36.420
through so much hardship whatever do a

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:39.780
coin flip Jennifer I can afford it to

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:46.050
new TV I'd rather not have to pay for it

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:48.000
I'm being jerkin out now her story was

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:51.180
good as soon as you read that one you're

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.230
like that salons gonna win but this was

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.730
like two weeks ago at this point

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:56.130
assigned this video goes up as ancient

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.660
history I wasn't actually gunning for a

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.640
new TV to be honest I don't think we

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:04.200
could fit a big TV in our apartment we

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:06.690
got like think we have like a 36 inch TV

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.369
by the way if you still watch TV or you

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.630
use the TV that would you know play

00:41:08.369 --> 00:41:11.130
console games or something like that I

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:13.440
hope you know how lucky you have it

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.960
because when I was a kid a big-screen TV

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.000
was like 32 inches now that's just like

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:21.980
oh yeah we got like that TV is 32 inches

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.380
TV prices have come way down when I was

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:26.520
until the age of like 10 I remember this

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.760
because it was a topic of conversation

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:33.359
among the at the dining room table until

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.850
the age of like 10 my family had a 14

00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:38.190
inch TV it was on the other side of the

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:41.010
living room and I had undiagnosed

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:42.869
astigmatism until I was like 11 years

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:43.980
old so I have no idea how I got any

00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:46.440
enjoyment out of watching television

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:49.170
just blurry shapes a hundred yards away

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:54.290
on you know a TV screen the size of a

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:59.210
postage stamp then my grandfather

00:41:54.290 --> 00:42:01.670
bought a 60-inch TV so he gave us his 27

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:03.920
inch picture tube and it was like the

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:07.670
whole world had changed I was like the

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:12.290
TV's twice as big all the stuff in 320p

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:14.660
is gorgeous and nowadays it's like you

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:16.760
know these computer monitors are like

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.530
you know 22 inches or something like

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.200
that I'm sitting an inch away from them

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:24.440
we got a I think our TV is like 36

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.800
inches we got a probably $200 that's

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.600
absurd

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:32.990
I'm pretty sure that when it was like

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.000
$19.99 I'm gonna die I know it dude

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:37.100
first off where's my damage where's my

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.100
luck and where are my red hearts that

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:43.990
allows dark bomb to make spirit hearts

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:51.980
out of them because I'm losing my edge I

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:52.550
need some support nothing dude oh this

00:42:51.980 --> 00:43:01.430
is bad

00:42:52.550 --> 00:43:04.070
oh you gotta kill him hey okay I'm

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:06.650
pretty sure he probably paid like $2,500

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:09.380
for it now and it's hilarious because it

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.970
was not like a 60-inch flat screen the

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:14.260
thing was like it took four dudes to

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:17.990
move it into their house and it was like

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:20.960
maybe like two feet deep it had a depth

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:23.120
to it and then if you sat like anywhere

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.040
that wasn't within like the prime 15

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.050
degrees of viewing angle the T it just

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.850
you couldn't see anything this is what

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:31.730
technology was like back then still

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:34.630
pretty good it wasn't like the 1930s but

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:37.520
you know it was

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.900
wasn't the beautiful TV environment we

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.910
live in these days I know it's the

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.770
classic NL discussion topic is back in

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.210
my day I almost walked on that creep

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:48.290
because it blends in so well with the

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:50.570
ground but really I was when I Kate was

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:52.100
like let's buy a TV this is a 2014 I

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.410
remember because I was like I got to

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:57.710
write that in my adult progress planner

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:59.810
but Bob first TV I was like an

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:03.980
investment when I was a kid it's like

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:05.630
you make payments on your TV I was like

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.580
holy sure you're ready for this step

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:09.440
buying the TV we went down to the future

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.400
shop rest in peace now it's called Best

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:15.800
Buy because they're owned by Best Buy

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.100
there's a TV on sale for like 200 250

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.000
bucks

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:21.740
no we can just we can just buy that not

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.859
say is not a you know a decent chunk of

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:28.940
change there's like the cost of a dental

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:33.320
appointment to have the future in our

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:37.060
apartment it's a wild world man it's a

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:39.530
wild ish world it's not really that wild

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.660
what we might lose but also

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:43.100
simultaneously win in our own unique way

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:47.869
in this episode you know what I mean

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:52.160
what I'm getting that is I think we

00:44:47.869 --> 00:44:55.609
could beat mom's heart we have a chance

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.710
to beat mom's hard and then not beat the

00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:59.300
cathedral-like I would like to but I

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:02.480
think that there's a decent chance we

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:04.640
just can't even beating mom's heart is

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:12.200
going to be like a bit of a leap of

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:16.220
faith here for us I think if we get like

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:20.900
a little bit lucky shouldn't be too much

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:24.500
of a problem and I stand by to this very

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:27.020
moment the idea that you know this run

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:29.570
is a little bit harder than the status

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:31.369
quo and I know it seems like how many

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:32.680
below average runs can this guy have in

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:35.180
a row obviously there's some like

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.099
observer bias going on or something like

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.210
that but

00:45:37.099 --> 00:45:42.990
I'm not fighting Hoshi I'll tell you

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:44.880
that much but I died sincerely believe

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.680
that like the last couple of runs of

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.480
Hannah you have been decidedly average

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.220
or below after four point two nine

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.839
damage I don't care what your rate of

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:57.240
fire is four point two nine damage is

00:45:51.839 --> 00:46:00.480
not enough unless you got soymilk to get

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:05.490
the job done in 2007 teams Isaac economy

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:08.339
here got these head of course is lovely

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:10.789
at this point I don't know I mean the

00:46:08.339 --> 00:46:12.900
cathedral is I think the Cathedral is

00:46:10.789 --> 00:46:15.990
easier for the point in the game in

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.160
which it is then the womb to is the

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:20.010
difference is that we haven't gotten any

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:22.319
better between them so I don't know if I

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.960
would bet on the side of us winning here

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:26.220
but I do think there's a chance

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.859
especially we can get like two spirit

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.910
hearts out of that not gonna happen but

00:46:28.859 --> 00:46:31.980
it's okay

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:37.680
go two and a half now with twenty three

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:39.420
bombs I hate this yeah I I had that

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.609
under control and then I stood in

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.309
exactly the wrong place but come on no

00:46:41.609 --> 00:46:45.990
smaller rocky to spy there's no big deal

00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:47.880
we got our spirit heart back life's good

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:52.650
and we also got teleported possibly to a

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:54.210
much better position here a lot of the

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:57.029
winds that we've gotten recently I've

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:58.079
been like kind of impressed even though

00:46:57.029 --> 00:47:01.819
I don't think I've been playing ten out

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:06.539
of ten on many of our recent runs

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:08.220
honestly dude sorry I'm there's been a

00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:09.779
lot of runs that we've won by the skin

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.670
of our teeth and I always think that

00:47:09.779 --> 00:47:14.520
like you're entitled to take like at

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:16.890
least ten damage over any run and the

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:20.130
worst of run is the more damage you're

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:22.109
entitled to take maybe a bit of a

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:25.109
harmful attitude for making progress but

00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:26.970
oh no no no it's nice nice nice okay

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:30.059
play this you got 13 cents try to get

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:31.710
some spirit arts out of it we actually

00:47:30.059 --> 00:47:33.510
might be able to beat Isaac on this one

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:37.279
which would be very very surprising to

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:37.279
me hopefully there's game sound as well

00:47:38.119 --> 00:47:45.930
okay we got High Priestess it's not a

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:49.109
great gift but it's okay for an Isaac

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:51.540
fight now the way I'm going to use High

00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:55.770
Priestess is I'm going to try to get

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:58.859
through the second phase of Isaac by

00:47:55.770 --> 00:48:00.150
just using High Priestess once I was

00:47:58.859 --> 00:48:02.150
hoping we pick up like an empress card

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:11.210
or something but this works okay

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:12.739
okay Lily smack

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.660
didn't quite get through the entire

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:16.729
second phase but that's okay now the

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:18.739
hard part oh that was a bad dodge we

00:48:16.729 --> 00:48:21.859
didn't get penalized for it now the hard

00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:25.509
part is actually making sure that we can

00:48:21.859 --> 00:48:29.180
get Isaac killed or at least to not just

00:48:25.509 --> 00:48:32.180
do exactly what he did right there which

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:34.130
is multiple attacks in the same wave so

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.319
bombs are going to be useful for that

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:38.719
our orbital potentially could be useful

00:48:36.319 --> 00:48:43.249
for that the more the merrier in terms

00:48:38.719 --> 00:48:44.599
of getting named to stand still okay

00:48:43.249 --> 00:48:46.819
that one's not going to work for orbital

00:48:44.599 --> 00:48:51.170
so throw a bomb in there throw a second

00:48:46.819 --> 00:48:54.680
bomb in there when you find in anionic

00:48:51.170 --> 00:49:00.829
and your damage is kind of direct throw

00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:03.099
a bomb in there don't you a bum oh you

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:06.650
got me dude I don't think I need it but

00:49:03.099 --> 00:49:07.819
he's got me dude dark bomb thank you so

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.249
much for your help I couldn't have done

00:49:07.819 --> 00:49:11.960
this without you

00:49:09.249 --> 00:49:14.509
sincerely looks like we're going to come

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.469
away with the W here scary run but hey

00:49:14.509 --> 00:49:16.880
thanks for watching hope you guys

00:49:15.469 --> 00:49:18.019
enjoyed it if you did click the like

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.859
button helps out a great deal of course

00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:19.249
subscribes you wanna see more in the

00:49:18.859 --> 00:49:22.099
future

00:49:19.249 --> 00:49:23.859
Oh what with Isaac now holds d6 the

00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:26.359
chest is now unlocked

00:49:23.859 --> 00:49:28.759
that sounded like a scripted moment it

00:49:26.359 --> 00:49:31.009
genuinely was not I thought that this

00:49:28.759 --> 00:49:32.989
run was over we have to take Thunder

00:49:31.009 --> 00:49:34.969
sighs I think hopefully it's not too

00:49:32.989 --> 00:49:37.519
much of a speed down it's unlike an

00:49:34.969 --> 00:49:39.289
enormous speed down but number one Oh

00:49:37.519 --> 00:49:41.049
number one actually does nothing for us

00:49:39.289 --> 00:49:45.559
because it doesn't adjust the dear cat

00:49:41.049 --> 00:49:47.269
parasitoid tears is lovely but I'm very

00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:50.119
wary about our chances here on the chest

00:49:47.269 --> 00:49:52.940
but at the same time we have lived down

00:49:50.119 --> 00:49:55.430
here so live to get down here so now

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:58.249
anything could happen but I think that

00:49:55.430 --> 00:50:00.769
we will probably die I'm going to give

00:49:58.249 --> 00:50:03.380
it the you know the old college try

00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:06.080
though yeah okay I shot every bomb

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:08.910
directly into myself

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:13.980
[Music]

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:13.980
okay lived through that somehow

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.140
keep them guessing keeping guests nicely

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.020
done

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:24.720
[Music]

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:32.730
look around extremely quickly for a

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:35.010
possible secret room no secret room

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:36.540
makes me a very unhappy boy we barely

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:38.670
got out of the way there throw a bomb

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:41.550
down it missed we almost got tagged

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:42.870
again we're back I don't think he's

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:50.460
gonna pay out there either

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:52.200
he paid out work with me your buddy work

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.870
with me we're on a fifty minute video

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.150
here and I'm not looking how do they say

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.900
it these days I'm not good enough lose

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.900
this one

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.440
okay bit of a cringe-worthy moment so

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:05.700
you know what I leaned into the cringe

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.980
if you lean into the creams it's not

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:12.300
awkward it's confident probably I don't

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:14.220
know antlers school that's like the

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:16.170
opposite of the effort it could get us

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.840
out of a bad dead end that we didn't see

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:21.300
coming

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:25.520
holy cow I was like a holy crap we did

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:30.240
it and then decidedly we did not do it

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.100
got a kill Lenny laughs here are you

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:36.000
kidding me it's like the angriest

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:38.930
spiders of all time whatever we don't

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.930
need all these bombs

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:44.650
step1 here is like kill this guy before

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:48.980
the other guy becomes a problem is nice

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:51.800
alright rinse and repeat now not quite

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:54.320
dead that was scary

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:58.490
shouldn't have done that dodge no HP

00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:00.680
that's fine this is a room where we

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:04.270
should not die like if we die against

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.270
Gerty we've made some mistakes

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:12.890
[Music]

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:14.390
Joker two hearts nice but I was hoping

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.560
we get like Joker into an Abaddon or

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:18.740
something like that but you're really

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:20.360
gonna leave me oh you're gonna leave me

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:24.680
right next to the boss room is what

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:31.040
you're gonna leave me I would really

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:33.770
like to kill the virus giving enemy who

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.480
was lost last but we he was chasing us

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:38.570
down and I didn't like our odds

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.890
so I'd provide my ideals we made it

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:49.250
through the room please be full of red

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:52.630
hearts well give you one cent okay okay

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.630
umm no

00:52:55.240 --> 00:53:02.780
thank God for the goat hoof man we're

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.500
just going to try to hold it as steady

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:08.330
as possible here our life is better you

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:14.360
know the further away we get from blue

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:17.030
baby he's in a persistent state of

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:19.730
slowness which is really good for me

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:23.780
I guess that's parasitoid tears working

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:26.300
its magic I'm not used to a blue baby

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:32.000
fight that's a this long or be this

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:34.600
serious though I will say at the present

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.200
moment until he moves we can't be hit

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:40.580
we're doing almost what I'm cheese I'm

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:43.160
sorry guys I hate to use the see where

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.690
I'm real cheese right now that was I got

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.220
a little too close and his shot got a

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:48.140
speed boost what does it have a jet

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.430
propelled engine in it for now though

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.450
