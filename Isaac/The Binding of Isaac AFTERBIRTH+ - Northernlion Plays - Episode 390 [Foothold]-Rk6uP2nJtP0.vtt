##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.870
what's up it's the binding of issac it's

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.820
your boy Northern Line and we lost like

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.889
freakin wicked badly on the last one

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
dude it was a nightmare now actually

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.630
because we're recording so much less I

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.740
think this is the wrong save file

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.330
because we're recording so much less

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.220
Isaac wait we won on the last episode

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.750
because we're reporting so much less

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.130
Isaac things David I'm like four days

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
since I last played and it's such I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.550
think I've lost all ability to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.430
understand what happened in this

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.120
previous thread of dialogue if you know

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.980
what I mean

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
so we have who Lilith we haven't done

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.960
anything with Lilith yet because she's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.100
difficult and she sucks and I hate her

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.250
but you know what Lilith

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.230
is pretty good at is greed mode so maybe

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.800
that could be like our gateway drug here

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.489
Kate qua wills he becomes another year

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.379
yeah there's no joke like Isaac is like

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.410
the series that I've set my watch to and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.329
the fact that we're recording not a huge

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.470
fan of this but I'll do it anyway fact

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.610
that we're recording a little bit less

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.900
of it kind of lost the let me put it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.310
this way because I did when I say that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.260
I've lost something it sounds negative

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.580
what I've gained is like a lot of time

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.080
to check out new games which I think

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.920
it's really for the positive for pretty

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.200
much everybody

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.790
but what I've accidentally ended up

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040
doing is recording like two weeks of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.240
backlog because two weeks of backlog is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.619
essentially the same as what would

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.180
normally come out during one week and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.000
I've got all this built-up Isaac muscle

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.920
memory so I'm basically accidentally

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.900
still making far too much Isaac just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.280
releasing it more slowly and I'm trying

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.829
to like adjust for that but it's a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.130
period that takes time to do so like I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.610
could never play Isaac for like the next

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.439
week and be completely PI like barely

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.979
even put a dent in what I've got in a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.340
can here so I got a settle into a much

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.509
like much more regimented routine you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.920
know the you know they say like when

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.200
you're working out the rest is as

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.259
important as the exercise that's clearly

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.719
false like the catch-22 is that you've

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.969
got to do the exercise for the rest to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.170
mean anything too much rest is just you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.459
know being legacy which I can relate to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.579
the word we're doing a lot of Isaac

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.569
exercise here

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.700
programming some more red states for

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.019
ourselves so we can get Isaac

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.489
hypertrophy and get to the point where

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.049
we start building our Isaac muscles back

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.389
copy but we've been doing fine on the

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.799
new save file I'm not super pleased with

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.590
the damage we took just there but this

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.680
is why Lilith is like a ten out of ten

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.540
green mode character is the ability to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.400
use the ability to use our ink you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.379
buddies here to just stack up and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.900
basically do everything that can be done

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.310
in one shot and make our life easier

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.909
than it is for a lot of other characters

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.620
so we still like we've been really

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.659
investing in deals with the angel

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.180
instead of deals with the devil in green

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.199
mode for the most part mostly one of the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.150
reasons behind that by the way is

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.900
because Kaos apparently shows up all the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.900
freaking time

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.530
might as well do this the only time

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.780
we're not going to press the button is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.750
if it seems like we'll die if we do or

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.000
will likely die if we do maybe a better

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.129
way to describe that because we're going

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.780
to lose for anybody here or three inky

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.400
buddies we have one quarter the damage

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.530
output placenta it's like a okay green

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.629
mode item we've already lost all of our

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.000
demon hearts so it seems like not a bad

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.290
choice obviously I don't think we take

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.150
black powder and we've kind of got a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:34.819
green mode formula working for us here

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:39.169
for better or for worse take the key we

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.759
should probably buy another key the

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.989
first would get hot bombs well we can

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:44.389
buy a key on the next floor if you want

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.269
to with hot bombs probably want to use a

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.669
bomb here that give us $0.10 it's

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.290
extremely good I don't think we really

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.120
want to pay for HP we should get some

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.949
naturally so blow that up it's another

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.919
five cents I will definitely pay for

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:04.129
blue cap which is HP n tears and I'll

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.139
definitely pay for compound fracture and

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.169
then we don't really have anything else

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.819
to do here so what I'll do is blow that

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.590
up and oh my god it worked I was mostly

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.750
just hoping to get the bomb for free but

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.060
instead we not only got the bomb for

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.519
free but also got analog stick which is

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.349
the tiers upgrade we could have replaced

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.639
that with the we could have used our

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.810
resources to re-roll in the reroll

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.270
machine

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.919
confusing sentence I suppose but not

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.900
necessary I would say and we'll blow

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.760
this guy up hope to get a key didn't get

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.720
a key but effectively got two cents for

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.230
free and dude pretty good first floor

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.960
here

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.560
HP two tiers upgrades actually two HP

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.220
upgrades as well because of placenta

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.050
some bombs whatever the heck we're going

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.450
to get out of compound fracture which I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.889
always confuse myself with because of

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.120
real benefit is that it's sort of like

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.440
the parasite but I might be missing

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.169
something all right

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.060
two out of three good pills please

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.740
that's actually completely fine yeah

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.800
actually starting with this is amazing

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.580
dude I'm almost at the point I'll be

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:12.110
straight up with you I'm not taking dr.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.660
fetus on a on the Lilith run that's just

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.340
asking for trouble core fun times one of

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.830
the two but I will take growth hormones

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.570
I sort of don't want to take chaos we

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:27.890
have taken chaos on almost every single

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:31.039
let's try this we've taken chaos on

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.710
almost every single greed mode run so

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.470
far it's just like I've lost the sense

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.450
of tailoring my own run so let's uh

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.890
let's try to mix it up a little bit this

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.810
time we're going to ignore chaos even

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.070
though it probably does give us a better

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.140
chance instead we're going to try to

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.690
build our own run kind of holistically

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.820
instead of just relying on chaos to give

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.520
us guppy items that we can buy on the

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.930
cheap right so I will say a ten out of

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.410
ten trinket fourths just crunching the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.150
numbers

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.639
if dude we can get triple-a battery I'm

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.430
going to be shows that's my new thing I

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:05.169
put H's in words where they don't belong

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.750
now what second one didn't really work I

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.520
figured you know if I can't get I'm not

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.950
actually mad about this by the way but

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.120
look harp on it as if I am if I can't

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.860
get people to think that I pronounce

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.370
words correctly to begin with why don't

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.380
we just go what a over-the-top start

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.690
pronouncing words and deliberately a bit

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.789
of an incendiary fashion and then I

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.280
don't know slowly watch my career died

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.050
probably the results we see as a as a

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.039
cause-and-effect relationship of that

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.449
but

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.129
what a beautiful way to watch you go I

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.120
hate to see you go but I love to watch

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:40.680
it leave as they as they say anyway

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.210
triple a battery is what I was going to

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.689
suggest so we could get our math to line

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.669
up but our math actually used to have

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.469
lined up already to allow us to get a

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.050
charge as soon as we press the next

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.330
button so maybe I was quite correct

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:59.729
about that either way that was like a

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:02.819
comically easy floor there give me b1

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:06.270
reroll with coins tell you what I'm

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:09.180
gonna go one deeper yeah I will take odd

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.520
mushroom small damage downgrade nice

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.439
tears upgrade I can't remember if it

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.349
breaks the cap but I'm gonna risk it not

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:19.409
breaking the cap and it didn't so I am a

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:25.439
silly boy either way down to the next

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:26.610
floor no tinted rocks and we're good to

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:27.559
go here I mean this run is looking

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.819
fantastic

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:31.589
we did lower our damage on the last

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.749
floor by taking skinny odd mushroom but

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:35.370
I mean that's an old controversy whether

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:36.810
or not skinny odd mushroom is worth it I

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:41.999
think skinny odd mushroom is worth it

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:45.180
like 98% of the time somewhere in that

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:47.930
vicinity at least this don't really want

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:53.629
spirit hearts check for a secret room

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:56.039
okay and pick up some more spirit hearts

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:57.810
but we don't have enough money to buy

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:59.339
anything here so we're kind of oh dude

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.569
you don't have to pay for we traded a

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:02.370
spirit art for a key there which is

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:04.020
actually kind of nice and we get the

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.779
parasite which I have no idea that

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.370
actually works with the compound

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:09.839
fracture the answer appears to be that

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.330
it works very well with compound

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:14.069
fractures so lucky oh I don't see us

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.169
losing this run so at some point we have

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:17.999
to you know figure out whether or not

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:20.129
we're going to start saving I don't

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:23.159
think we're quite at save all of our

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:26.129
money level but we'll we'll see as as

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:28.289
time progresses here because I can't

00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:31.589
speak I can't hold still the only thing

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:33.599
I really know is she got sex up hill yes

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:35.490
yeah if I was actually going to workshop

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:40.019
a character I think my character is guy

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:41.719
who reads song lyrics that cheat in

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:43.159
order to earn a rhyme and

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:44.839
is them in a normal English language

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.300
voice now that's a hard thing to kind of

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:50.990
conjure up at runtime but crazy times

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:54.439
butterfly is definitely guilty of that

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.060
I can't think I can't hold still the

00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:57.459
only thing I really know is she got sex

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:03.279
a pill

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:08.509
she's got a sexual pill like a cialis or

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:12.250
even a Viagra I don't know why they all

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:15.290
sound like the names of Greek gods I

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.879
I've seen this before and I'm actually

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.629
asking out of curiosity because I'm

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:19.100
assuming we you know we got a

00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:20.689
cosmopolitan group of people I watched

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.370
it don't worry I'm not going to ask you

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:23.959
you mean you take boner pills that's a

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:27.230
little I'm overstepping my bounds there

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:31.100
um but I watched an ad recently I can't

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:32.389
think it was what was it before because

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.209
it was important I think it was like a

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:39.290
sporting event and there was an ad for

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:40.970
something who we've unlocked conquest no

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.230
wonder we got meat boy so easily we

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.379
didn't even have conquest unlocked

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.779
anyway I think we should take the halo

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:52.970
this early in the game and maybe skip

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:57.470
the rest it was an ad and it had a lot

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:59.509
of middle-aged and older individuals for

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.790
all looking around doing things and it

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:03.889
was like you should take blah this is

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:09.620
why you should take blah but it never

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:11.569
ever mentioned the proximate cause for

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.430
why you would need this medication to

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.829
the point that I started to get a little

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:18.259
upset if I'm being honest I'm going to

00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:19.220
take this to get closer to spawn and it

00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:21.529
ended up working out really nicely

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.819
actually I don't know I don't want to

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:25.790
say that I got offended because you know

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:28.399
of course medical issues are your own

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.050
business however I was watching an

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:32.329
advertisement for a medication that

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.519
never said what it treated or what the

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:37.459
effects of it were it mostly was just

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:41.480
almost like an Adult Swim style montage

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:43.449
of those tacky moments in pharmaceutical

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.009
commercials or it's always like you know

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:47.660
my life has been taken away from me and

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:49.610
then this medication brought it back and

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.949
it's like him you know playing frisbee

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.389
with his daughter or something I know

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:54.450
what you're going to say you're going to

00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:56.700
say

00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:00.690
it's boner pills but I feel like the

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:02.100
boner pills ads are not discreet they

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:06.050
don't say hey this will give you a big

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.920
old hard-on but they show like you know

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.410
there used to be the ones that were like

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.690
good morning good morning it's fun as in

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.310
you know it shows Bob smiling and his

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.050
wife smiling as well and you kind of you

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.630
can piece it together this I can't

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:23.430
stress enough this one was literally

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:24.990
just old dudes playing around outside it

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.240
was like they were trying to advertise

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.310
it was like an ad taken out by their

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.900
competition to be weird so I don't know

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.140
if anyone has ever seen this I know I'm

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.720
giving you bad criteria here but if

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.880
you're familiar with this please let me

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.220
know because the curiosity has just been

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.600
eating me up inside it's probably

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.730
something innocuous like blood pressure

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.320
medication but I do worry that maybe

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.990
it's actually an advertisement that

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.490
awoke like some sleeper agents deep in

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.910
the American South or something like

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.070
that

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:57.150
like some Manchurian Candidate stuff you

00:11:53.070 --> 00:12:02.550
know it feels like I watched it in a

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:04.740
fever dream we are actually crushing our

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.380
tears are not individually that strong

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.470
but we are just like oh it's probably a

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.800
holy mantle as well but we are just

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:17.100
dominating in terms of efficiency of

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.390
those tears because like every shot all

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.470
I didn't need to buy that we can make

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:23.720
use of it but I didn't mean to buy it

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:28.890
every shot we don't need battery

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:30.780
generates like four shots off of it can

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.130
this give you bandaged girls if it can

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.720
give you bandage girl we got a try

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.720
basically I'll take that as well

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:46.269
it only gives boys who are meaty dude

00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:48.069
with holy mantle go for the two four

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:49.869
levels I think you got us you take

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:54.309
spider mod as well as cheap now I've

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:55.420
invested in winning as opposed to oh and

00:12:54.309 --> 00:12:57.249
dude they're going to get we're going to

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.110
get at least one extra level for meat

00:12:57.249 --> 00:13:01.269
boy every time you press the button

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.439
right I believe I think that's the case

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:03.429
I know it looked like we only had one

00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:05.709
there but I think that's just a

00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:08.619
byproduct of them like overlapping yeah

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:10.389
so nightlight is just okay mr. Dahle

00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:11.949
gives us a range upgrade which is

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:14.170
irrelevant but it does give us one black

00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:16.779
heart which is somewhat valuable I

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:20.769
suppose let's just worry about winning

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:24.660
now because I have kind of going to take

00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:27.790
this I've kind of risk everything for

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.949
potato peeler which might have debatably

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.299
been a horrible idea either way let's

00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:32.949
give this show on the road so we got to

00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:34.929
meet boys I really want to see what

00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:37.470
happens when we get our new next played

00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:40.660
we have for me boys

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.919
we have to meet boys I feel like this is

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.600
something we tested recently with

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:45.970
exactly the same result Fox and Friends

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.679
doesn't increment our meat boys under it

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.259
all it gives us an orbital that's right

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:53.230
all right kind of sucks it makes sense

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:55.269
but well it doesn't it doesn't it makes

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.209
sense because it's obviously like a hard

00:13:55.269 --> 00:14:00.009
coded edge case where orbitals just go

00:13:58.209 --> 00:14:02.559
up a level for meat boy and bandage girl

00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:06.160
but at the same time I don't have Cuba

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:07.929
meat I have you know to meet boys that I

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.739
created through an item that no longer

00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:13.720
is this I don't think we you need to get

00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:16.119
that battery so it's just two batteries

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.919
and we definitely should get one and use

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:21.790
it but that's mostly just because of

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:23.919
like generic best practices either way

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.629
we're going to steamroll these sections

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:31.089
where things are going to become much

00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:33.910
trickier is when it comes time oh please

00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:34.660
spirit out well walking on sunshine too

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.459
okay

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.649
luck up is nice if we can get it to

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:40.689
manifest those are other cards the Sun

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:42.759
the Sun with no red hearts doesn't

00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:45.120
matter walking on sunshine does and we

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:47.460
can go here because we have

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.190
so what do you do I think you grab a

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.260
bomb and walk on the spikes for no

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.400
reason that's a big part of it you blow

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.720
that up that sucked

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:59.070
okay so then go back in here we got that

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.690
right we need another bomb in order to

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.920
take advantage of that wait it out a

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.210
second you're worried about

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.070
turns out the battery wouldn't have been

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.410
that bad now it's spending a lot of

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:10.020
money on batteries here and or sorry I'm

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:12.240
bombs it's not really good practice most

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.730
of the time got a little lucky that one

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.970
worked out really nicely for us so the

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:23.010
next step is start using this a real

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:28.470
roll machine you get spun which is very

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:31.200
nice of course some of the time and then

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:33.510
you hope for five cents here because I

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.790
wanted nine volt but it's probably

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:39.030
irrelevant I guess we're just we're out

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:40.500
here in the fields where we're fighting

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.690
for our meals how many floors we got

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:50.550
left it seems easy enough right now but

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:53.250
we do want to continue donating 10 cents

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.710
is not a lot to donate we absolutely

00:15:53.250 --> 00:16:01.020
need to have a full charge available for

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:04.260
our mega greed fight or we're going to

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:07.770
be unhappy with the results I think so

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.720
just push this up here I mean I on the

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.190
one hand I I don't feel like I should

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.800
need to apologize but on the other hand

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.750
I feel like people sort of like have the

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.860
wrong idea with apologies I'm going to

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:21.990
use this and then use this like people

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:24.060
and I've said this many times before but

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.230
I still think like it's not like it

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.290
falls on deaf ears

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:33.170
people take an apology as a sign of

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:33.170
weakness which I don't agree with

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.380
so I'm gonna say it's like two tangent

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.910
figure I apologize these read mode

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.010
episodes tend to be a little bit shorter

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.650
but I also understand if you're like you

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.870
don't need to apologize you betta you

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.980
know garbage man you didn't make the

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.930
game it's true

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.940
I like the green mode runs I guess we

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.860
can save this battery and then use the

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.420
charges as much as you want we didn't

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.770
make the we didn't make the game and the

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.000
green mode runs tend to be shorter and

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.990
they're also a little bit easier and

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.250
they've got to be done

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.010
so it's kind of like that perfect storm

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:06.160
of life you know why sweat it right but

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.510
I like apologizing I don't I don't see

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.790
your publicising as a sign of weakness

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.860
if she apologizing as long as it's

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.600
something that you know is a productive

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.900
apology I think it's a sign of courage

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.520
to apologize to admit that you've uh

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:22.449
that you've done something wrong and try

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:26.500
to work past that I didn't lose holy man

00:17:22.449 --> 00:17:28.300
today so I'm not necessarily taking

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.680
responsibility for the fact of the green

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.870
mode episode sanity shorter

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.490
rather what I'm doing is saying I know a

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.530
lot of people out there one like you

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.930
know 40 plus minutes Issac entertainment

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.730
a day greed mode sometimes gives you 21

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.560
minutes of issac entertainment a day all

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.840
I can really say is that will be past it

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.160
and I hope you're enjoying the green

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.080
mode runs will they happen because it's

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.110
one of those you know don't want to know

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:54.940
we seem to go that you don't know what

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:58.470
you got till it's gone we're not as

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:00.880
green mode and then it never came back

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.500
well we can't even get rerolls here so

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.220
you got to kind of take a little think

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.450
wouldn't you say we could buy damage

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.230
upgrades tears upgrades

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:13.030
that's Pisces so it's not even spirit

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.020
hearts we can't really buy spirit hearts

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.930
I think we this is going to be

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:21.480
surprisingly tight looking for secret

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:26.460
rooms for no reason really but okay oh

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:29.080
oh you know in five cents to blow up a

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.690
to blow up a tinted rock I think at this

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.370
point is a very good compromise

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.560
well worth it okay we have two more

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.900
bonds we could use those bombs against

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:43.210
the boss but this not really much reason

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:46.960
to use one here sure okay I'll use one

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:49.060
here oh I mean I didn't even pick up the

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.910
key there there that is a little

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.070
unfortunate but okay we should still be

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.720
fine holy mantle protects us once I was

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.110
hoping to at least get one penny for a

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.730
bomb

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.490
normally a terrible trade but you know

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:04.600
in greed mode why not is kind of my

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:06.100
perspective on it if we know we don't

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.690
need the bomb for combat we might as

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.010
well donate one more cent right

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:13.000
same reason I'm going to blow this guy

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:18.430
up we'll head through to the ultra-green

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:23.590
fight it should be relatively easy look

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:25.090
a bit relatively easily the one thing I

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.490
will say about greed mode run is that

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:30.340
like feel like I don't get to build a

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:34.210
longer Pig so we'll try to keep like you

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:37.410
know this is the appetizer and at least

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:39.790
we're building like some support as Lily

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.620
you know we're building confidence we're

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.570
getting a base level interaction with

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.400
this character that I can understand now

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.050
greed mode tends to be easier because

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.290
for the most part you can just buy

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.760
whatever you would like to buy and you

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.110
know the items that you buy tend to be

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.840
better than items that you don't have

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.370
any choice over selecting okay steps not

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.630
abundantly clear but I imagine it

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.190
probably it's for many of you because

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.680
it's the second time for a lot of you to

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.780
be watching this stuff so it looks like

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.980
we're easily going to be able to get

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.980
through this donate more money

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:17.690
our green machine is that like 200 and

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:20.020
something I think that hurts me when you

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.020
do that

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:27.540
the keys are irrelevant like the runoff

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:29.220
from are like lump of coal compound

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.809
fracture parasites shot that is going to

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.580
kill them the only thing that would make

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:34.050
this run better in static tears or

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.710
jacob's ladder' I know they're pretty

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:39.540
similar but to get all of these shots

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.830
like really quickly getting out there

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.120
you can't really see because of lump of

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.210
coal but like the shot speed seems

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.559
pretty solid right now and then every

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:50.070
single one of them creating electricity

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:55.110
bursts would be like 10 out of 10 this

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:58.110
run that president is like a nine so

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.460
fairly easily done there box of friends

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.500
has appeared in the basement which is

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:05.550
kind of a bummer because I will never

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:07.350
ever buy that item as anybody I buzz the

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:11.000
friends does show up in the shop but

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:14.820
it's so rarely like a sensible choice

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.020
the majority of the time it's like what

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.540
familiars are you looking to double

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.710
anyway everything's a thank you this is

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:27.780
a good little brimstone I understand

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:31.200
either way three two one drop on Sonoma

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.429
that's two hundred ninety cents I don't

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.130
think we could might blow this guy up

00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:37.230
right you did take six hundred damage

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.240
from it but apart from that nothing all

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.590
right easy little aperitif to get us

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.790
into the mood here and record some more

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.260
Isaac for now thanks for watching hope

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.850
you've enjoyed the episode if you didn't

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.740
click the like button it was a short one

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.179
but we'll be back tomorrow and every day

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.740
after that in the lead of the universe

00:21:48.179 --> 00:21:52.650
for now thanks for watchin and I will

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:54.919
