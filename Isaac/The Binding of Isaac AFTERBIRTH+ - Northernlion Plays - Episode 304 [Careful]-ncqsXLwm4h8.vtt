00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.810
hey everybody welcome back to Norton

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.950
land please the binding of issac and

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.270
truth plus we've been doing eating runs

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
that we've been crushing it lately let's

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.259
keep crushing it Gary Vaynerchuk style

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.030
can I actually move yes I can so we got

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.379
it's a good run I give this like a five

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.869
and a half to it six which i think is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.789
completely okay poor speed poor rate of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.340
fire maybe slightly better than average

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.480
damage great HP good spacebar item

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
that's good enough you know it's not a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.119
ten obviously it's not a ten I'm not

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.570
trying to be ungrateful by saying that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.579
this is a five and a half M Oh just

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.079
being honest about the you know my

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.120
appraisal of the situation as it stands

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.050
we have a space bar item that is pretty

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.390
okay it contributes to a transformation

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.010
that actually gives us some benefit we

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.870
have twelve bombs which actually you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.969
know you might think I'm I'm gassing you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.440
up here but I'm not I think having a lot

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.449
of bombs in the early game especially if

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.600
you're dps is not that good it's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.829
actually pretty useful when it comes to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.899
not completely screwing the pooch okay

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.810
so how that worked is sort of beyond me

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.990
but the haunt is totally screwed even if

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.780
he doesn't actually get hit by a bomb

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.150
the fires will just tear him up so he's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.700
well and truly dusted just try not to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.080
get hit at all easy money three bombs we

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.659
get a speed upgrade takes lift at one

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.860
point two three and honestly we could

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.150
probably leave this floor but let's try

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.320
to get enough money to make an arcade

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.520
app and that's that's something that we

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.860
can leverage to our advantage for

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.299
certain certainly I would suggest you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.780
know we got a long way to go on this run

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.750
we I think damage is not terrible but

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.000
our dps is pretty bad twelve rated fire

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.619
is not awful but it's got a lot of room

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.290
to grow for being 100% Frank right now

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.549
which Frank I don't know I can't think

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.820
of that many Frank's off the top of my

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.540
head Frank Stallone that's Sylvester

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.540
Stallone's brother perhaps most famous

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.520
to contemporary audiences for his role

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.909
in that tim and eric' sketch where he

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.329
sang with cern in your bedroom back into

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.270
the computer room and it makes good

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.590
sense it's the only way you can sleep

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.190
out on the captain till you find to play

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.470
anyway you get the idea Frank Stallone

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.000
he looks like Sylvester I mean it makes

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:27.310
sense they are brothers siblings I mean

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.870
they're brothers but I meant like not in

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.250
the brothers from another mother sort of

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.900
way they have the same mothers what I'm

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.790
trying to suggest here at least to the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.110
best of my knowledge anyway I don't know

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.720
we haven't done like anything on this

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.610
floor of note except for get a speed

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.819
upgrade and this is probably our second

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.980
secret room like I'm looking for

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.200
potential advantages here but I kind of

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.480
feel like we're hemmed in on all sides

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.769
like there's just not a lot of there's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.870
not a lot of things to leverage here

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.450
until literally just now where we picked

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.160
up 27 cents and a luck upgrade for the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.950
cost of two bombs that's pretty good

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.660
it's a better than average response from

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.670
throwing a couple of bombs out there

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.920
into the ether I would suggest so blow

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.269
this up get a spirit art there you go

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.799
that's almost enough for the wind by

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.459
itself unless we lose it really quickly

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.930
here and I say that because I mean the

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.940
deal with the devil especially

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.920
considering how much HP we have probably

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.560
gives us you know what just saw stood

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.549
gives us a few different inroads that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.930
could take us to greatness

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:31.989
so moving box I I don't I don't hate it

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.290
at all and I've used it at least on one

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.150
occasion alike very good effect I don't

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.880
think it's like particularly great

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.560
necessarily but it is interesting so I'm

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.590
going to I'm going to roll with it I'm

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.200
going to try to destroy monstro here as

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.049
best as I know how so we're going to if

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.060
possible get him to jump onto this fire

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:59.530
or we can bring the fire to him that

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.340
might do it right there okay good deal

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.290
with the devil

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.480
cat-o'-nine-tails given us the damage

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.860
upgrade we want we really don't want

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.690
anything here so it's looking more and

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.590
more like a deal with the angel run so

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.959
how did we make that filigree feather

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.299
angelic Spoils well if we're going deals

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.639
with the angel that was very close then

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.250
that seems like pretty okay but I

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.530
believe what we did with this was we

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.290
stacked up all the items we didn't want

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.260
and then we used a black rune to turn

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.120
them all into stats upgrade upgrades and

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.250
then like swallow penny was involved

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.910
somehow someway I keep coming up with

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:43.250
funky ass stuff like every single day so

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:47.030
I don't really we're kind of waiting on

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.770
like a black rune existing but you can

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.540
make some pretty cool moving box plays

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.190
let's be honest Book of Satan is not

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.160
part of my long-term plans I don't care

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.940
about that bomb for your otherwise it's

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:04.580
like the thing is you want to suck it

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.229
out hilariously enough because then you

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.560
can double everything that you've sucked

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.020
up so we're creating a monster this is a

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.240
strange situation I know I keep saying

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.400
that but this is the same that almost

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.780
like you have to be organized in yours a

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.750
deenis here which is a foreign concept

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.030
for me because moving box I really don't

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.580
understand the value of it outside of

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:30.710
this exact situation like being able to

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.990
carry bad items together is only good if

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.370
you can find a way to productively do

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.130
something with them eventually like get

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.479
a d6 for example you know a D 100 would

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.850
work a cracked dice would work but you

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.210
need some way to to get them all to pop

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.160
off it so it's really only plausible if

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.930
you have a situation in which your stats

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.900
are already decent you know what I'm out

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.210
take me out of here we've already seen

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.030
our shop we know that something else

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.050
available in it so okay well and we're

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.419
not even done with this floor yeah I

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.810
mean just let me go okay

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.260
sanitarium let me be okay just begging

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.510
you here

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.510
Chris was amazed please all he's done it

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.690
second secret room I'll use the bombs

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.330
let's get out of here

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.480
Ace of Hearts you know it's pretty bad

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:26.669
but maybe one day we'll find a reason to

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.350
use it okay caves one how the heck do

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:36.360
you make this work well we are looking

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:38.940
for help me we're looking for a black

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.639
rune avoid item anything along those

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.229
lines actually I'm not skeptical about

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.030
our chances of getting one I'm a little

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.580
conservative I'd say we have like you

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.770
know probably a better than 50% chance

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.300
oh that was rough but it's not

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.979
guaranteed that we'll get one for

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.000
certain but I think that you know you

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.620
know I wouldn't be surprised if we

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.820
picked up a black room especially we get

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.389
a rune bag or something like that it

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:03.330
makes it that much more likely without

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:05.340
that we really should just go with

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.120
swallowed penny which is actually

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.350
crooked penny in general you probably

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.280
want to use that to take out the source

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:21.539
instead of what we did but these guys

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:25.410
have got to go something's got to go

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:29.220
somethin's gotta go your dude we've done

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.390
okay yeah otherwise we don't really get

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.169
much benefitted we should just go with

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.479
what we've got already

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:34.860
which you know swallow penny is probably

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.900
the crooked penny I should say is

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.850
probably one of the best items in the

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.320
game even if it doesn't pop off for you

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.060
in the situation what you wanted to pop

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.560
off the most on average you're going to

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.870
get a lot more out of the item than that

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.850
item gets out of you which is a

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.320
nonsensical statement but you sort of

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.970
get the idea I'm getting that hopefully

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.039
anyway just keep crushing them here

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.080
daddy longlegs will buy you some time

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.700
the only thing bad about our present

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.419
situation really is our rate of fire

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:02.400
even our damage is pretty good and our

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:06.479
future potential is is off the charts if

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.190
we can get black room you want to be

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:10.249
able to suck up items you don't want is

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.839
the thing so

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:14.329
I killed that guy when I had the chance

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:15.889
we can give daddy-longlegs to break the

00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:18.289
stalemate here I mean that was nice

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:25.939
thank you you did take out two of those

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:27.589
silkworms but didn't even take damage

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:29.539
kind of a surprise to me not going to

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:31.789
blow those up because I want to save I

00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:35.419
want to save our bombs for basically the

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:38.000
boss room actually I should say Wow

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.519
don't need to save one bomb for the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.610
angel statue but I mean it would be nice

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:45.350
to have the chance to fight the angel

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:49.040
statue just to get mega Satan happening

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:51.290
on on a run that is in a daily but it's

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.970
not essential remember by the way to

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.959
suck up an item we need to charges

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.490
because we need to put everything down

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:59.389
and then we need to pick everything back

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:01.309
up I guess the other thing you could use

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:02.930
the moving box for is if you have a d20

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:05.360
or something like it you could put all

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:07.279
the consumables that you can ever get in

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.660
one room together and then you know

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:13.279
accomplish things that way but these all

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.579
strike me as pretty low percentage plays

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:21.009
although the movie box is one of those

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:24.439
rare super Fringe case items where we

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:27.860
completely like got the dream case to

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:31.449
work the first time we ever had it I was

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:34.910
trying my best but I mean now I'm just

00:09:31.449 --> 00:09:37.579
throwing some HP away sadly but please

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:40.220
give me something decent yeah I mean

00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:41.360
latchkey it gives us the spirit ours and

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.779
the luck upgrades not going to hurt

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.610
either but we really did get to like the

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:48.709
dream scenario where we have so many

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.350
items we didn't want we sucked them all

00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:53.420
up we deposited them double done with

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.279
the crooked penny and then use the black

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.829
ring to suck it all up a stat upgrades

00:09:55.279 --> 00:10:00.290
and that was like absurd and that's

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:06.189
probably fairly unlikely to happen again

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:08.360
but if it did I'd be a happy camper

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:11.569
we've already found our secret room so

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:17.779
we know it's not going to be adjacent to

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:19.459
the curse room sadly uh okay so blow

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:21.170
this up your Miata is kind of like a

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:24.379
weird situation

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:29.179
by trinkets melter smelt your trinket

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:32.389
grab moving box suck up drink smell oh

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:34.730
you put everything down grab this suck

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:36.290
it all up okay I don't know maybe those

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.119
things that are in those items are all

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.709
getting charges the entire time we're

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:43.279
holding them in moving box we should

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:44.749
check on that next time maybe I did

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:47.869
sacrifice the spirit art to come in here

00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:49.790
I was kind of looking for a way out from

00:10:47.869 --> 00:10:51.230
being on it's like a way is something

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.579
that maybe like the pack or the mother

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.449
the pact of the mark or something like

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:57.949
that could have given us something good

00:10:55.449 --> 00:11:02.809
but it's not like it's a bad run it's

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:05.480
just kind of just kind of an for now and

00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:06.980
if we don't ever get a chance to get

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.600
deals with the angel I think that that's

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.939
a problem I also have no idea what our

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.829
trinket that we just smelt it does but

00:11:10.939 --> 00:11:15.109
you know it said Angel spoils so I'm

00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:16.220
assuming that you know it doesn't look

00:11:15.109 --> 00:11:17.809
like it gives us a better chance of

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.980
getting a deal with the angel so I'm

00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:23.329
guessing that it makes angel rooms

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:25.459
better which also is in keeping with the

00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:29.059
theme of like the whole most recent

00:11:25.459 --> 00:11:31.299
booster pack so can certainly understand

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:35.660
where they're coming from on that one

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:36.889
feels like it's probably a secret room

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.129
but do you really want to go to a secret

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:41.419
room might want to we probably could

00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:43.639
have left it and push that bomb again

00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:46.730
but that's okay I'm thinking we want to

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:49.850
use our bomb to find a tinted rock and

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:53.059
like a tinted rock alone because I need

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:56.119
or to kill boss I guess but I need to

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:59.749
maintain our maximum plausible chance of

00:11:56.119 --> 00:12:01.369
getting a deal with the devil so we

00:11:59.749 --> 00:12:03.290
could throw the items down here and then

00:12:01.369 --> 00:12:04.549
suck up those I guess that's another

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.369
thing I hadn't considered you could use

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:10.819
the moving box to suck up consumables

00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:13.429
that you otherwise couldn't get like

00:12:10.819 --> 00:12:14.869
those ones right there and and then you

00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:17.720
could deposit them in an area that's

00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:19.189
gettable but you could do that for items

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.470
as well as the clothes sometimes you do

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:26.359
get items that are like marooned on an

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:28.999
island basically that you can access

00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:30.259
unless you can fly and oftentimes you

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:33.130
know super early in the game you don't

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:37.180
have that luxury so

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:38.680
I don't think it's probably like very

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.790
low percentage that we'd have the

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.070
opportunity to get one of those

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.600
situations early but if it happens it

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:47.170
happens

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:51.280
rah mega this boss is kind of poopy I

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:54.130
wish he'd just think dirty

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.400
rah mega never let me get a deal with

00:12:54.130 --> 00:13:01.870
the angel please I mean daddy longlegs

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:03.640
crapped on him but I got it I got in the

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:07.060
bad situation now I'll admit that was

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:11.800
like very preventable but it looks like

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:14.890
it's going to be kind of a kind of a

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.570
rough and tumble run here I should say

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.730
you know a hundred percent mean we kind

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.980
of put everything down first to suck it

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:26.920
all up but you get the idea you know

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:28.510
what let's do that we need to keep these

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.220
to get the charge did I mean that's

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.870
going to be charged obviously if this

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.980
charge is not charged they don't get

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:38.230
charges when they're in the box that's

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:39.400
them it's sensible unfortunately and

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.600
then we'll suck everything up in there

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.710
and then as a result of sucking

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.180
everything up in there we'll also add

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.910
four cents to our equation that we could

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.850
pick up the next time you put these down

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:50.170
and we have enough rooms left we should

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.790
be able to get a battery charge

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:56.050
if we can't though that's going to be

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:59.010
real nasty let's say we want the rainbow

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:01.870
worm it's just sort of not that good

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.280
okay it's almost like a blessing that we

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.110
see that there's more rooms down here so

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.340
I should be able to get a full charge I

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.820
mean if I didn't at this point it would

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:13.150
be very surprising ASA spades also

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:16.360
pretty good if we're in dire need of

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:20.410
some keys we could turn all the pennies

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.630
into keys and then suck them up but it's

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:25.270
not worth anything to be honest with you

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.010
that's what we needed is black room

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.920
right there so now that like this run is

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:32.470
taking on a new dimension now just keep

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.030
black rune and we still to get to our

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.800
item room as well our shop is probably

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:38.890
not likely but our item room is very

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:42.370
plausible so we could if we wanted to

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.240
pop black rune early and the only

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.190
consequence

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.900
I love the tears up

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:53.130
though it's not much I hate the knock

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:55.630
back but I love to watch it leave we I

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:59.020
mean there's what I'm getting added here

00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:02.380
is there's a trade-off could be worse

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:05.920
sadly our luck is luck is like a luxury

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.390
sad if it's good and you care about it

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.730
then your runs probably going alright to

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:16.570
begin with

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:21.760
feels like a secret room on well we

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:23.920
should pick up all this stuff it's like

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.990
one more room left here I mean we should

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.730
try to get the boss rush we kind of

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.440
leave in that decision of the last

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:34.120
minute here or you know one of the later

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.530
minutes but it is somewhat sensible to

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.630
try to get the boss rush not only

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.040
because of the moving bucks which could

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.180
pick up all the items of boss rush but

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.730
also because a black room which could

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:47.050
then suck up all the items but we might

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.510
be a little too late to even make that

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:52.000
decision but we're going to try and I'm

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.980
kind of looking at this run the longer

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.990
we wait to use black room the more value

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.880
it will probably provide for us but it

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.350
the relative value of what it provides

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.340
for us is going to change you know it's

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:03.790
going to oscillate it's going to

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:06.640
fluctuate rapidly potentially like a man

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.470
in the desert a bottle of water might be

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.940
worth a million dollars to him are we in

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.890
a statistical desert right now with

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.990
respect to our attributes not quite I

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.860
mean five point four nine damage is not

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:20.170
terrible 11 rate of fire is not terrible

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:24.210
for HP necropolis 1 it's not terrible

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:29.860
but it's it's approaching terribleness

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:32.260
you know it could be there in a way you

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:36.400
know having a jack of all trades master

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:40.030
of none run and Isaac doesn't really

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.310
work as well as you might think like if

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.410
your gears are seven and your damage is

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.940
nine then that's a little different than

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:51.760
if your tears are 11 and your damage is

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:54.050
five and a half but daddy longlegs does

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.940
bias

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:58.500
sometime here plenty of battery charger

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.240
so we can suck up a lot of items here if

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.410
we're if we get the opportunity but we

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.290
want to pick up items that are good for

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:07.230
us right off the bat dude this King

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:08.880
champion here it's absurd does that

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.709
thing drop a battery charge when it dies

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.310
that you should not have lived that long

00:17:10.709 --> 00:17:15.959
it doesn't make any sense

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.010
just let daddy longlegs do the dirty

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.600
work for you here because otherwise

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:21.209
you're going to you're going to take

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.420
damage it's just like if you break the

00:17:21.209 --> 00:17:25.709
poop you're going to take damage or if

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.060
you break this poop right here I mean

00:17:25.709 --> 00:17:28.110
you're going to take damage just let him

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.300
do the job for you

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:32.940
if we had done anything else there we

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.110
probably would have been hit and then we

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.760
would have lost our deal with the angel

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.470
chance and then that might have tilted

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.610
me to take an even more bad damage over

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.880
the course of the run you know it's just

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:44.790
is a potential cascading effect there so

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:50.520
we want this it's not much but it's a

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:52.050
little damage and it's a little HP we

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.080
don't need the money right now either so

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.700
I'm just saving our all of our charges

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.920
including the one that we have active

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.140
right now until we know if we can get

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:07.350
some value out of out of what we got

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:09.240
cherry a card very very useful this

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.940
floor is really where it's all going to

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.590
come down to right here we don't need a

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:19.670
great deal of the angel but it would be

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:19.670
really really really nice to get one

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:26.000
come on daddy longlegs Daniel day-lewis

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:28.740
hooked me up

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.360
hit the right enemies we're not going to

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:35.160
make boss rush I've given up on that

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:38.960
pipe dream to a minor extent I'd really

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.960
rather not use a chariot card right now

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.980
you know we could have a greed fight

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:48.270
coming up you could have a disagreed

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:50.310
fight coming right up this if nothing

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.160
else should like give you a hint about

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.660
how this run looks right now because the

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.890
fact that we are unable to kill double

00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:00.960
chub here in any conceivable and

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.950
sensible timeframe I think it tells you

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.040
everything you need to know which is

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.880
that we are we're circle in a turlet

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.690
right now

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:11.660
or to put it in other words I'm not sick

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:19.799
but I'm not well

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:21.660
give me some damage that'd be swell you

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:26.100
know there you go something going on

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:29.280
there I love the look of grapes um I

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:33.080
mean I guess I can pay money to pick up

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:37.500
the compass tells us where to go

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:40.140
got a mini-boss back there we should

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.549
probably just I mean we need to go back

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:51.600
for black rune so let's go do that

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:55.799
I don't know I'm feeling all of the

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:58.049
burns simultaneously this really feels

00:19:55.799 --> 00:20:01.110
like if we can just play well for like

00:19:58.049 --> 00:20:06.720
two more rooms beat the boss without

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:08.159
getting hit the world's our oyster but

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.030
if we mess it up it could be that the

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:21.809
world's our turlet we plan and we should

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:24.690
it okay okay okay just be cool he did go

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:27.510
over the fire for about you know zero

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:31.260
point negative one point two six seconds

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:34.260
I mean I had I really did I hit as best

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.669
as I thought I could we took out an 11%

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.169
chance of getting a deal of any sort

00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:41.010
that's not horrible it's not great

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:44.820
though come on come I mean pacifiers

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:46.890
good it rate of fire is now and in fact

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.720
pacifier might actually be great our

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:54.390
rate of fire is good enough to maybe

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:55.860
justify let's head down and find out by

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.150
the way I may have been like I may have

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.500
made a big mistake on that floor if

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:03.000
there was a spirit hard in the shop we

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:04.650
should have bought it don't let me just

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.900
get off scot-free for that one that

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:10.230
would have been a very very important

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:14.010
potentially like if not game winning

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:16.020
like game helping a great deal sort of

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.000
situation so

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.180
that would be what I would consider to

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.640
be a fairly major mistake but it could

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.560
have slipped my mind it does happen as

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.000
your I'm sure well aware but there might

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.600
also not have been a spirit heart in

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.640
there but if I was implicitly running on

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.970
bravado not a good idea unless you're

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.800
singing helicopter by the you know by

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:41.100
block party great song class the

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:44.030
all-time classic so we're gonna spit

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.350
everything out here we might as well

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.690
take the money and it doesn't really

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.190
matter and we're going to spend our next

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.630
charge sucking everything up because we

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.540
got IV bag out of this which we don't

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:56.430
really want but it is another stat

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.800
upgrade eventually because of black room

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.300
so this huge positives there and I'm

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.770
hoping that the ones for you at heart we

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:06.450
picked up from pacifier is going to do

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:08.450
the job here certainly like no green in

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:12.360
our shop would be nice but I wouldn't

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:13.770
mmm it's a little tight there honest I

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.230
mean we could suck that up but we need

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.580
another couple of charges so we're gonna

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.890
have to look at that as kind of like a

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.600
balance I think as we get over there

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.010
because this there should be a battery

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.330
charge in the shop if there's no greed

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:28.800
fight and then we'll we'll tackle it

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.540
from that point onwards we don't need to

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.920
suck up the boss items for example and

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.890
we've already missed boss rush so that's

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.330
not as much of a concern straight-up

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:39.600
this is an easy decision you by the

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.580
spirit heart we have no reason to take

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.870
there's options or more options we have

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.590
a reason to take there's options a

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:47.880
little bit not a huge one and actually

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.600
there's a bomb for sale we should buy

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:53.480
one of those as well but first we're

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.510
going to go over here and we're gonna

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:59.580
suck it all up we're going to suck up

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:02.040
Samson's chain I think we got more than

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.780
enough rooms given the extra battery

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.710
charge so sure I think we'll suck it up

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.880
we're going to suck up everything here

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:11.670
Samson's chain is interesting but it's

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.690
not good enough to to make it into the

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:16.800
rotation so we've got to spit everything

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.090
out in that room and then we got to suck

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.410
it up again if we get another bomb you

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.460
just use it on that situation right

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.080
there

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.790
just to make sure we have enough charges

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.210
I can't imagine we wouldn't I mean there

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.210
you go right there

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.570
I'll just buy it because there's no

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.240
point to saving our money right now

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:37.039
spit everything out leave we don't have

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.580
like a really impressive Hall right now

00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:43.610
but the point is this could all go

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.860
horribly wrong but you know me Oh same

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.029
old G so what I'm going to do is is use

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.620
crooked panty to try to double

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:51.470
everything and if it turns into nothing

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.360
then the whole gambit failed but you got

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.940
a try I mean what kind of person would I

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.929
be if I didn't try to shoot the moon on

00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:03.830
this one that's right I'd be a capital P

00:23:59.929 --> 00:24:04.970
piece of garbage it's like you're

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:11.149
starting a sentence with piece of

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:15.379
garbage is the proper noun so this is

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:16.909
just a smart Isak trade that I wish I

00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:18.649
didn't have to make but two bombs for

00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:21.470
three bombs and some money and some keys

00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:22.879
sure I mean it's a good deal if that's

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.379
how you spend your Sunday afternoon is

00:24:22.879 --> 00:24:25.940
making that deal on Craigslist you'd be

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:30.080
like you know my side hustles going

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:31.519
alright but it's not the sort of thing

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:36.259
that single-handedly puts us in the win

00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:41.809
column I think we're ready to leave this

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:44.500
floor again no at this point actually no

00:24:41.809 --> 00:24:46.970
conceivable way to make foster rush oh

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.669
well that was really dumb three bombs

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:52.039
does give us some extra damage we could

00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:54.500
pop out against mom but like dude daddy

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:57.049
longlegs is like actually hot trash

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.629
against mom and blue mom is the worst

00:24:57.049 --> 00:25:01.370
possible outcome but we can persevere

00:24:59.629 --> 00:25:04.039
we've had a few different opportunities

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.710
that haven't been even been the easiest

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:09.350
bosses you know like brownies not the

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.570
easiest boss and then to go up against

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.230
blue moms sucked and you know even raw

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:16.519
mega

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:20.899
who's actually rag mega on Wow

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:25.000
kind of a jerk but at some point you got

00:25:20.899 --> 00:25:25.000
to like you got to own it right

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:42.690
that was bad but we did get her lease to

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:45.169
land on the fire the fire the fire we're

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.169
so close

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:55.890
come on dang it

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:59.630
he's done it it's a deal with the devil

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.630
honestly that might be for the best I

00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:08.669
mean I'm not thrilled about the items

00:26:03.809 --> 00:26:10.289
but I'll take copy anyway in the hopes

00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:14.279
of making more happen in the future but

00:26:10.289 --> 00:26:16.470
man oh man I'm starting to think after

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:17.909
this floor is where we take the we take

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.610
the plunge I think this is what we did

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:22.590
last time as well but starting to think

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:25.919
that the right way that you handle this

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:27.960
is you just go you beat the boss you see

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:29.399
what there is to go in the bathroom and

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.029
the deal with the devil room is possible

00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:35.580
and then you from that point onwards

00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:37.230
probably just go for the doubling to

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.850
kill all doublings from from crooked

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.320
pennies it's not as big as the last one

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.029
and of course there's a 50% chance it

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.649
gives us nothing it's an idiotic

00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:45.960
decision what I'm about to do is an

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:47.250
idiotic decision not from like a

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.260
public-safety don't try this at home

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.120
standpoint but from like if you're

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.799
worried about winning the run standpoint

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.909
if that's your number one priority is

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:59.520
winning don't do this it's a 50% you

00:26:56.909 --> 00:27:01.470
you're at like a 3 out of 10 and you can

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.610
take like a guaranteed 5 out of 10 which

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.789
is probably good enough for the win

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:08.100
you're taking a 50% chance at a 6 and a

00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:11.850
50% chance is staying at a 3 the optics

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:14.159
do not make sense but we're doing it

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:17.669
because I also like from a meta

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:19.890
perspective and running a business and

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:21.630
the the right thing to do in the

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:25.559
entertainment business is to entertain

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:30.730
people so we're going to throw caution

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:33.260
to the wind and we're going to try

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:35.270
nobody's we know watching this episode

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.280
going oh I wish NL would be a little bit

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.690
more conservative on the with his

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.500
approach here it'd be really nice if he

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:45.050
like this is not golf this is uh eSports

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.240
baby has nothing against golf maybe a

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:50.150
win 99 will be playing golf but this

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:56.930
ain't golf yet I hope we can make it

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:59.030
Golf one day me is unlikely but I wanted

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:01.910
to check because we we have a very very

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:05.660
outside chance of the guppy dream and

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.920
I'm talking like we need this floor to

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.360
give us a deal with the devil which is a

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.340
one-third chance then it has to have

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.960
guppy items well Krampus is still alive

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.090
and like you know that we're starting to

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.900
get into some unlike unlikely situations

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:19.100
there's what I'm trying to get at but

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.680
bloodbag would be nice I mean if I'm

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:24.470
being Frank with you we could use the HP

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:26.750
as sad as that may sound I also do not

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.550
necessarily think we're guaranteed to be

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:30.110
able to beat the boss of this floor with

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.520
half a red heart of one spirit heart so

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.140
I'm going to be a little bit more

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:39.620
conservative than you might normally see

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:45.440
me being here it's fine we'll go back

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:49.250
and get some more that's great thank you

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:52.220
very much this nation owes you a great

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:58.010
debt now shut up and let me do my job

00:28:52.220 --> 00:29:01.880
okay 1.43 speed now we're talking knock

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:08.030
back still pretty bad but only a parent

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:12.290
on rooms like that so this is really

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:13.790
going to be our our moneymaker right

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.490
here maybe that judgmental never say I

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:19.300
should have blown up the judgment that's

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:25.010
actually just like the correct decision

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:27.820
Wow I did not get hit there I basically

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.820
just should have

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:38.040
so you're going nowhere you died first

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:41.850
are they immune to fire am I losing my

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.590
mind we didn't beat the odds and that's

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.600
okay this is still the moment of truth

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.370
we drop the coat hanger or we pick up

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:53.660
the coat hanger sorry we drop everything

00:29:47.370 --> 00:30:01.320
else we pick this up come on let's go oh

00:29:53.660 --> 00:30:02.610
don't don't do wrong okay I mean the

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.040
sweet isn't it sweet without the sour

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:07.260
baby you got it you got to know that

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:10.320
that's a chance going in it does hurt

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.820
though but you know our rate of fire is

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.800
picked up a rate of fire is almost

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.960
tripled since since I was complaining

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:19.620
about it so it's not like this runs got

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:21.360
no prospects it just whiffed a little

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.950
bit on the crooked penny play but still

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.450
I wouldn't change my heart like I

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.800
actually started beating a little faster

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.840
during that and you know what to get

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:31.140
that experience in Isaac in this day and

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.360
age for me worth every penny get it

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:38.580
because we got one penny from the dump

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:41.250
dump down Wow okay you got to go double

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.570
that okay well you know at some point

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.220
you're gonna have to work with me here I

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.900
wanted to get to 10 cents because then I

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:49.050
was like this guy's guaranteed gonna pay

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:53.280
out one cent not so much huh okay well

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:54.480
get dusted young I gave us money but we

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.570
don't really care about money at this

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.570
point

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:03.150
head down to the next floor and we're

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:05.820
still fine is the thing like it's gonna

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:08.820
be I'm not gonna lie to you gonna be a

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:10.770
little touchy here but it's not a it's

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.170
not a terrible run it's not like I'm on

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:15.270
the womb like I can't kill anything it's

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:19.530
just going to be a little slower than

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:21.270
average you know we got okay damage

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:21.600
although the damage is kind of a sore

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.290
spot

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.180
we got good HP although not great HP but

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:30.960
our rate of fire is is now probably

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:33.990
stellar so it buys us a little bit of

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.760
leeway not a ton you know this isn't a

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.320
run that I would say oh if you're like a

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.100
beginning Isaac player you would win

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.300
this run too

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.740
this is like an intermediate finish

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.180
but you know we got that we got the

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.630
protocols we got the skills to pay the

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.110
bills

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:48.760
occasionally no not me and kg we haven't

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:53.770
got the cognitive capacity to lead

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:58.720
alright we'll do it we'll continue last

00:31:53.770 --> 00:32:02.620
week we will continue last week okay

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:08.920
well I mean we we can't go to the curse

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:10.540
room yet because we need to maximize

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.630
deal with the devil chances because that

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:16.270
could work out very nicely for us one

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:17.620
spirit heart now works for us to do that

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.810
don't hurt yourself on these please

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:23.170
perks is fine range down is irrelevant

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:27.640
forty-eight hour energy does not matter

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:28.810
yet but could in the future something

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.710
you paid out with something and we could

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:34.570
double it but so we got a lot of blood

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.260
bank opportunities it's going to tell

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:38.170
you straight up

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:45.220
that's fool's gold right now this is

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:46.900
what you're looking for so you pick up

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:49.000
two spirit hearts you could have tried

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.910
for another doubling but let's not get

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.630
too fancy here this is where we pull the

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:57.310
run out of our buffs basically should go

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.650
little on this one

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.970
not much just you got to give gotta give

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:03.460
the game a chance to be nice to you

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:06.610
before you yell at it for being mean to

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:09.130
you go grab this sack of spirit heart

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:11.620
what do you get two spiders not a good

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:14.640
payout but it only cost us one spear at

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:17.650
heart so now we go back and grab this

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.270
two black runes like which we could try

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.680
to create with swallowed penny is

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.000
actually an integer which is actually

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.320
crooked penny it's actually an

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.270
interesting decision because it's one of

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.540
the few things that doesn't provide us

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:30.970
with a benefit from such a panic drop

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.950
but at least we can get some value it

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.840
doesn't provide us with any value via

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.810
being doubled you know it's not like we

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.880
can suck up an item twice we can suck up

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:41.290
on two different opportunities but we're

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.390
really trying to use this to maximize

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:47.350
one opportunity as much as possible so

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:48.970
small Rock is also I'm not dude shake

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:51.610
what your mama gave you on that one so

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:52.930
we got a better rate of fire I never

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.970
should have been hit there

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:57.130
that's my bad but better rate of fire

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.340
and better damage and our speed can

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:06.820
absorb the penalty here so that's like

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:10.300
fantastic and our rate of fire has

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:12.520
broken the cap so what we need to do now

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.950
is kill mom before she does attacks that

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.410
can hit me and I don't think that's

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:20.440
going to happen the less enemy she

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:26.430
summons the better but really just turn

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:28.660
on good northernlion right now beams I

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:29.440
guess right on the beams and that's

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:35.770
going to save us

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:37.900
Oh No Deal no 72% chance culminates in

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:41.350
No Deal you know what that's why it's

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:43.060
called 72% chance not 100% certainty and

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.520
I'll just go ahead and say it we got to

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:50.320
look for the dice room you know just for

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:51.610
curiosity's sake but um we and I want to

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.660
point out before I say this because

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.980
people are going to take this out of

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.290
context even though I'm going to give

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:59.350
you this little preamble here we have

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:01.540
gotten a little unlucky on this ride bad

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:04.570
bosses like some of the hardest bosses

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:07.180
in the game to perfect and we've gotten

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:13.780
them with no spirit hearts ok just cool

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:15.850
your jets here and then like very poor

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:20.500
spirit hard generation throughout the

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:23.050
entire run and then not getting a deal

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.400
with the angel forcing us to pay HP at

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.710
least I felt like it was forcing us to

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.270
pay HP for the future prospect that

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.950
never really came to fruition by a guppy

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.150
scholar you know we never got another

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:35.500
deal with the devil after that is what

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:38.470
I'm trying to say I think I think we did

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:40.780
get some bad rolls here a lot of bad

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:43.990
rolls more than more bad rolls than we

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:48.820
get on average all of that being said we

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:51.580
should still win even with the bad rolls

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.170
we could have played better and we've

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.780
ended up creating a run that is still

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.890
good it's better than fine it took a

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.910
little while to get there but it is

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.910
better than fine now

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:10.340
daddy longlegs straight I'll just tell

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:15.500
you straight up actually the least

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:18.620
favorite enemy in the game because he

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:24.920
does some damage that is nearly

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:27.080
unavoidable that possibly could have

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:32.120
gotten me there you got to take him out

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:32.390
I mean no no I'm not ready to go thank

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.520
you

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:36.680
permanent polaroid invincibility please

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.860
Dustin he's dusted okay play cool play

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:46.040
cool doesn't worry about that room taken

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:48.740
hits twice is fine the real problem was

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:58.700
the room two rooms before that let daddy

00:36:48.740 --> 00:37:02.920
longlegs do its job let's go

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:09.530
let's go that's what we're looking for

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:11.200
we got rear oh Jesus like we got eighty

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:17.150
damage that's pretty solid

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:20.860
we got The MITRE 2020 epic ech in case

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:25.060
you didn't notice the a Cubs ladder and

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:28.400
the ankh which is actually fantastic oh

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:30.620
and kidney stone which is pretty

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.380
terrible if I'm being honest in this

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.750
configuration but right yeah I'm sure to

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:40.280
saw that coming should have seen that

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:42.680
coming our range is tear I'm not sure if

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:45.280
we improved ourselves here but we do

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.990
still have black rune and we went from

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.160
it's mom's eye or whatever is shooting

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:52.010
out behind us here that's that's

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.500
actually hell but thank you infamy thank

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:56.090
you infamy again the are you seeing my

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.510
problem here because my problem is that

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:02.140
I cannot shoot there's there's so many

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:07.029
situations where if I shoot

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:10.450
I'm guaranteed to take damage so like

00:38:07.029 --> 00:38:13.210
there's there's occasionally situations

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:19.779
in which I can survive but not too many

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:27.720
uh this is still really bad in fact it

00:38:19.779 --> 00:38:32.559
it almost might be worse but maybe not I

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:38.230
don't know it's it's a wild one man this

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:43.869
run is the threat has changed it's like

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:46.119
the game ain't the same certainly if we

00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:49.890
hit an enemy they're in a rough spot I

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:49.890
mean they're they're taking some damage

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:54.460
it's everything leading up to that that

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.710
scares me if we get past Isaac we use

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.690
black rune maybe you get like we could

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:04.539
use the range upgrade also we have seven

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:08.410
range seven range it's terrible and then

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:10.539
on top of that our peers explode so you

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.900
know it's it's a rough it's a rough

00:39:10.539 --> 00:39:15.670
situation right now

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.539
hey but we got a luck upgrade so you

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:27.369
know it ain't all bad

00:39:16.539 --> 00:39:33.119
Oh in my defense the speed is also a

00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:36.369
really bad like that almost got us there

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:37.599
okay literally got ah should have known

00:39:36.369 --> 00:39:42.809
should have known it was just question

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:45.009
mics at this point so what can you do

00:39:42.809 --> 00:39:46.089
except for just accepting that you're

00:39:45.009 --> 00:39:48.910
going to take a hit there what can you

00:39:46.089 --> 00:39:55.539
do if you don't shoot you're gonna get a

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:58.960
hit several red hearts please okay I

00:39:55.539 --> 00:40:01.509
mean you just blow them up Tammy's head

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.630
there's no way that Tammy's head is

00:40:01.509 --> 00:40:06.000
anything but awful for us but you gotta

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.460
try

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.460
[Music]

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:31.210
like maybe you can kill the boss I

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:34.410
actually cannot get far enough away this

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.410
is a serious problem

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.750
I don't think I can get far enough away

00:40:39.089 --> 00:40:44.490
to use Tammy's head so mom's bottle of

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:47.099
pills will go back for it assuming we

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:49.230
survive this we got kidney stone kidney

00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:51.480
stone is actually like an enormous

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:58.470
punishment I can't stress that enough it

00:40:51.480 --> 00:41:01.740
looks like we're going to survive holy

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:03.839
crap we live okay so you got it you

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.160
can't take unless you get like I mean I

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:11.970
was going to say let's get unicorn stuff

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:13.980
but that's nonsensical got it you got to

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.990
take this even though this has a low

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.849
expected value there's nothing else you

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:21.260
can roll with here that makes any dang

00:41:17.849 --> 00:41:27.320
sense you just got to go with this and

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:32.609
then you're just praying for luck here

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:37.740
sure okay I mean you really should blank

00:41:32.609 --> 00:41:40.920
card black room and that's 0.25 range

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:43.050
upgrade you might as well use kidney

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:47.940
stone here where you can at least be in

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:54.980
a safe environment why on earth would

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:54.980
you go to the small room thank the Lord

00:41:59.529 --> 00:42:08.690
that's like that's unaffordable damage I

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:11.630
don't want to use kidney stone cuz I

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:12.440
can't oh my god I lived I thought I was

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:19.099
dead actually

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:20.690
I can't sure but I can't shout this is

00:42:19.099 --> 00:42:27.109
the end of this streak I've come to

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:29.619
terms of it now I got a shot out into

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:29.619

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:36.410
it's kidney stone yeah I I mean I'm not

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:37.970
