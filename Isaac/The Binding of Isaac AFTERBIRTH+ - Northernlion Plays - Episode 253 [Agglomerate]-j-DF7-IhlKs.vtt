00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.100
everybody welcome Megan online randoms

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.440
gets a bad character but then gets like

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.730
the most unprecedented ever in the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.410
binding of issac afterbirth clusters

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.950
that the K so we're going to do it again

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.349
are we

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.680
okay Lilith is actually not that bad

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.930
which means we're destined to lose NF e

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.769
to hbw B you might be saying I don't

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.470
understand these rules you're not wrong

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.779
the rules are arbitrary they're made up

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.260
we win with bad characters we lose with

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.369
good ones

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.940
that's the rule actually the only real

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.489
rule the only real rule is that you lose

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.340
with Lilith surprisingly like cellar

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.480
doors sentence to say the only real rule

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.300
is that you lose with Lilith

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.770
the only real rule is that you lose with

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.719
Lilly

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.760
it's like English language proficiency

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.629
exam rate they're all what makes you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.219
small even I can't say it so I'm gonna

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.300
have to go back to you know learning how

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.550
to talk school you know what that was a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.700
great use of a black heart as far as I'm

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.170
concerned you might be concerned about

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.510
the fact that I took damage there but I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.799
honestly that was productive so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.250
productive I'll take you to the candy

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.540
shop I'll let you lick the lollipop with

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.040
this I don't know how many different

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.360
tangents have gone on a minute and 15

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.890
seconds in here but I'm floundering

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.979
looking for something a little bit more

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.080
meaty 50 senses I'll take you to the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.020
candy shop I'll let you lick the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.840
lollipop it's very inconsiderate I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.030
hadn't thought of it until this moment

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.500
that's pretty bad what about the next

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
person who cuz it comes into the candy

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.270
shop what if she goes to the candy shop

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.689
she licks the lollipop and then she goes

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.810
yeah I don't really like it and the next

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.570
person gonna be getting the thirty

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.390
lollipop unless he's talking about

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.049
something else you think he's talking

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.549
about something else when he's talking

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.630
I'll take you to the candy shop I'll let

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.369
you little lick the lollipop come here

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.329
girl don't you stop keep going til you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.329
hit the spot low

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.070
come a long way from the Beatles I want

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.610
to hold your hand haven't we showed up

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.520
grandpa

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.580
right anyway we got some Harding baby I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.040
think this isn't a you know pretty

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.930
terrible item but we also have Incubus

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.790
which is a pretty great item so this is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.890
six of one half a dozen of the other

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.290
let's get these pinkie buddies lined up

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.030
here and just fire some twenty twenty

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.090
shots into the ether okay well if you're

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.980
going to force me to move like a switch

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.800
foot song then I will indeed get out of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.989
the way and I won't be saying no thank

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.050
you to the opportunity however I would

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.680
love to see DPS up health can come in

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.470
time right now we need that DPS all

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.950
right we got health specifically novel

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.300
we asked for but life goes on candy shop

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.380
is one of those songs I think of because

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.970
we're into these like I am not old

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.390
despite the fact that I pretend to be

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.860
sometimes for comedic effect however my

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.230
generation has gotten to the point where

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.630
nostalgia is a relevant thing so you

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.090
know people who are 15 in this day and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.440
age they'll occasionally I'm not saying

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.110
everybody but they'll leave comments on

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.610
YouTube videos for like simple plans you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.160
know how could this happen to me or I'm

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.890
just a kid and life is a nightmare and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.660
they'll be like man I was born in the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.670
wrong generation it's already started to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.590
happen

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.810
back when music was music yeah but we

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.549
did also have candy shop but I'm not

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.329
saying that candy shop is like a bad

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.390
song at all you know get rich or die

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.130
trying' classic album I know that candy

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.870
shop is on bulletproof but you get the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.610
idea

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.650
people will be like music that's back

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.360
when singers really wrote their own

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.760
music and it was wholesome and it wasn't

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.290
just about dirty stuff what about genie

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.239
in a bottle you got to rub me the right

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.930
way honey I'll take you to the candy

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.160
shop I'll let you lick the lollipop hit

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.980
me baby one more time

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.610
oops I did it again baby that's

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.959
specifically the Austin Powers version

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.910
musics always been looted man if you go

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.840
back to like Beethoven's fifth symphony

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.269
you know Dan Diana Santana sent them if

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.950
that had lyrics it would be like I'll

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.410
take you to the

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.190
freaking candy shop and if you'd like

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.340
you lick the lollipop you may lick the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.640
lollipop and buy the lollipop I mean my

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.640
fella

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.630
you guys ever watch The Late Show with

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:42.580
Jimmy Fallon he's killing it lately it's

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.110
really affable good natured family fun

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:51.440
except for the fact that Jimmy phallus

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:57.260
is a penis a walking talking and throb

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:01.520
amorphic affable funny late-night male

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.750
member of the male persuasion as Dan

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.890
would say we are floundering

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.060
conversationally here or having great

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.680
commentary depending on your perspective

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.170
I'm in a zany mood because we just you

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.760
know I finished the NL SS like half an

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.520
hour ago and I haven't had a chance to

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.330
decompress from the NL s or decompress

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.940
from NL SS as you would say if you were

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.800
sending out an SKS for example with one

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.730
of the Inc you buddies betrays you it

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:33.290
hurts man don't don't move don't loose

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:37.370
there you go farting baby can you do

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.650
anything we're going to get a deal with

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.150
the devil here I'm very eager to get

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.720
something that transforms this run

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.980
because it's fine but also like a little

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.870
not great especially long-term right now

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:58.450
range in luck is not really going to

00:05:50.870 --> 00:06:03.650
change that much kind of a weird one huh

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:05.180
you got to take void and I got to take

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.840
boy I mean you definitely like do not

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.210
have to take void but I'm going to take

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.320
void cuz now once every six rooms we can

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.320
get a box of friends

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.469
as worse than once every four rooms but

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.900
the potential to turn not-so-great items

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:24.479
into greater items is pretty high okay

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:29.729
that thing tracked me the whole way

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:32.490
please give me a key I need a key that's

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.680
probably a library we use void to suck

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.360
up all of the books doesn't mean we win

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.969
but it probably gives us a leg up on the

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.349
competition

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:46.499
he's done it this is great

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.939
so year's book of sin use Necronomicon

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:49.589
we don't even use neck now let's not be

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.599
ridiculous useless we got the bookworm

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:53.699
transformation pretty important we use

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.680
void we suck it all up we got another

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.689
spirit art we got another penny okay and

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.289
then there's more battery charges back

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:04.199
here we've done it it's not quite as

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:06.080
lucky as our triple guppy room last week

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:11.449
fudged around and got a triple Gubbi

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:14.999
Gubbi freakin streaks every way like

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:16.949
cobalt strike thank goddess say today's

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:19.949
a good day we're going to take out these

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.330
pot just to get the gup-b precedent head

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.889
down to the next floor we're not going

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.240
to use our voice are immediately we're

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.370
going to use it on the first room with

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.849
combat that we come across like this

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:34.289
room for example no not that room unless

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:38.430
we got a key we didn't get a key right

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:45.209
there dude Necronomicon is actually a

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:48.629
pretty good void helper keeping in mind

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:50.639
that you know Necronomicon is once every

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:51.569
six rooms and so is void normally it

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.279
wouldn't be that good because we'd be

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:55.169
using void to suck up items as opposed

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:57.330
to dealing damage but what we have here

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:59.939
is actually like a great opportunity to

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.259
use void offensively which doesn't

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:04.050
happen all that often I tend to use it

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:06.389
prominently as a utility item so you

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.339
know we see unites and we don't really

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:09.629
like and we cycle it we go I don't

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:11.490
really want that range upgrade let's

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:12.539
turn it into oh cool plus one shots been

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.689
amazing

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:17.729
instead we sort of because I run sort of

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:18.899
sucks right now on a statistical level

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.309
we kind of have to use it as an

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:24.689
offensive item which has actually been

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:26.729
working out pretty darn good so far so

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:28.230
we're looking for another bomb I think

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:31.020
we do want to use our dwell we

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:36.900
I not need to use a key that was close

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:40.950
to get into our item room we could use a

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.910
bomb instead we should try to peep it

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.220
though I mean we don't have a bomb

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:48.300
either is the thing so we have one bomb

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:50.460
we need to let's go

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.310
this feels like the secret room though

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.430
doesn't it it could be that other

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:59.160
location but just something about this

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:02.310
Thank You farting baby okay not a second

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.660
time I see something about the the left

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:08.640
of us here feels like the right call

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:12.060
another cue okay I think now we just go

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:16.470
to the item room five bombs is worth it

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.550
as far as I'm concerned sure a damage

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.630
upgrade would have been better and at

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.570
some point we got to commit to that

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:25.560
damage upgrade but or come into the

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:27.930
statistical change but not yet the stars

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.680
okay well all you know what there's a

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:33.090
play here

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.850
I do wish we had a charge but that's

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:43.350
fine and we can spend two bombs to get

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:47.870
four bombs that's a good deal we're

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:50.189
going to come back open these

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:53.220
we don't even want to suck that up so

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:54.449
that's fine and we got our we got our

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.209
money's worth we didn't get our keys

00:09:54.449 --> 00:09:59.040
worth for going through there but

00:09:56.209 --> 00:10:00.449
suppose life goes on now we're probably

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.220
not going to get a battery charge unless

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:05.129
we have a shot before our boss fight

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:12.120
which I'm sort of skeptical of we'll see

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:13.620
11 cents for a 11 Swain on 11 cents we

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.949
have 11 bombs that we have a bomb that

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:19.379
we can use to get a tarot card I think

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:23.759
it's worth it pretty much regardless of

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:25.550
what the tarot card is yeah okay now the

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:28.199
question becomes what's worth more a

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.610
hang demand card or the card that we

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:31.499
would expect to get from the hangman

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:35.600
card it's kind of a confusing situation

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:39.300
isn't it this is a great opportunity to

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.769
take nine volt it also gives us a charge

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.249
immediately so you might want to hold

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:46.290
off ever-so-slightly

00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:49.889
we look for tchen it's basically the

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.569
exact same thing as in in terms of

00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:56.399
utility it's basically the exact same

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:58.769
thing so I'd like to see more combat is

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:02.370
net this is actually sort of unfortunate

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:08.129
because now the right call is to buy

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:10.620
this but we shouldn't use the charge yet

00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:14.569
we should fight the boss first even if

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.569
we have to use bombs against the boss I

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.860
think this is the right call what we we

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.120
we know we want Cuba me but we could get

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.339
a deal with the devil we want to suck up

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.870
so that might be more valuable here so

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:32.129
we certainly want key with me and we

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.929
didn't get a deal with the devil so we

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:35.490
definitely did not have to wait on that

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:38.179
but that's okay we know what our

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:41.220
strategy r it's a pretty obvious

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:47.160
approach for us to take any time the

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:50.339
charge is available use it but use it on

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:54.329
a room that has combat already dude when

00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:56.279
you do a big room with nine volt you get

00:11:54.329 --> 00:11:58.949
three charges instead of two that

00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:01.980
doesn't seem correct am i missin

00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:04.420
tributing that to something else

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.369
because that doesn't seem like the way

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.139
that should behave but I'm not

00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:11.079
complaining oh you know no way I had to

00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:15.369
confuse a triple-a battery it is right

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:17.980
because 9-volt starts you with one extra

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:25.559
charge triple-a battery charges you with

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:33.040
one less required come on

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:34.119
good lord he's done it you have a

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.980
special room back there this is the

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:37.869
perfect time to get a charge here dude

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.999
you can hit me basically as much as you

00:12:37.869 --> 00:12:41.980
want I already hate the fact that it's

00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:45.339
run as 3.5 damage with a 12 rate of fire

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:52.149
this late in the game you guess you want

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:53.739
to suck up both of those that hurt me

00:12:52.149 --> 00:12:57.779
oh the mushroom blew up okay so it is

00:12:53.739 --> 00:13:00.100
wait what which means that there is a

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:03.220
unlimited bomb soar once every six rooms

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.209
you can get a bomb I don't think there's

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.129
anything else you really could have done

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:09.459
there unless we had a reroll I can we

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:12.129
don't want to take wait what it might

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:13.869
and it's kind of a big if but it might

00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:16.239
at the present moment be better than the

00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:21.069
void but it shouldn't be better than the

00:13:16.239 --> 00:13:23.379
void for long but I would have loved if

00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:26.919
either and or both of those items were

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:29.769
passive because unfortunately instead of

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:31.720
getting any statistical increase almost

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:34.600
any of which would be worthwhile right

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.649
now including speed tears and damage

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:41.499
obviously range maybe not so much but

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:43.509
instead we got two active effects that

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:48.100
are going to provide almost no impact

00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:50.439
once every six rooms so bummer so now

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.059
I'm in full-on make the audience angry

00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:55.509
mode because I'm like why would I use

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:58.439
anything but Cuba meet here got to

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:58.439
protect my sanity

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.010
plus we're generating spirit odds pretty

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.850
regularly once every five rooms

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:12.010
technically don't think we want to get

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.600
that battery charged if we do want to

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:17.040
get it we don't want to get it yet so

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:21.940
this is maybe perfect we should get a

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.620
charge just after the boss fight which

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.780
means we can't be tempted into using it

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:29.230
before the boss fight we definitely want

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:31.570
to avoid trinket smelter dude champion

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.240
Gerty is like not saying we're not going

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:39.790
to get hit but basically the ideal boss

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.380
fight for us to have if we're going to

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.290
be using a cube of me to deal all our

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.310
damage so I mean are you watching what's

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.580
happening here it's working out very

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.580
well

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:59.860
easy money okay not a deal to devil I

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:05.410
think we probably just want that I would

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:06.850
I would take basically anything here ok

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.740
being concepcion just gave us a second

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:11.470
Incubus that really lightens the load

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.570
for us when it comes to you know let's

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.190
suck it up we got the speed upgrade

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:21.310
anyway we just got a shot speed upgrade

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:26.140
along with it so long floor dude like

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:28.480
literally it's a call floor but I was

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:34.780
looking for tears or damage obviously we

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:37.000
got neither that is a charge which is

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:39.940
very good but I want to suck up the

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.310
trinket smelter so could you I'd like to

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.780
find the opportunity to get the trinket

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:47.490
smelter if possible maybe we should be

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:51.910
using camo on these more rigorously

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:54.760
that's not gonna give us money the

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:56.590
donation machine will give us haki not

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.360
have we had it under control there but

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.940
the donation machine will give us money

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.220
I don't really want to have to use it

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.510
but we can use it we've already been

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.950
rude to our donation machine but this

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.540
seems like the kind of run that needs it

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:11.900
to be honest with you

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:15.920
right now particularly sure we got

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:21.890
bookworm and then on top of bookworm we

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:23.870
also have we also have a second Incubus

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.850
I don't really care about smelting the

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:29.270
toilet paper honestly it sounds like a

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:31.010
you know Swedish sex position I'm not

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.580
insulting you of your Swedish I'm but

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:36.530
grudgingly admiring of your innovation

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:45.050
yeah it's not American as it is move

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:46.940
down the next floor so we are just going

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.920
to pop this like as regularly as

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:52.730
possible where we getting our chair Iike

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:59.960
it must be from book of sin tears down a

00:16:52.730 --> 00:17:01.520
moon card get out of here you why were

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:05.150
you so confused at the start of that

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:08.020
room why am I still using three point

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:10.910
five damage dude it's cruel and unusual

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:13.970
punishment I see you're cruel and

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.949
unusual punishment China in through it

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:21.110
doesn't really work at all like that one

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:24.890
like super at all yeah let's peep it I'm

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:29.200
willing to go for it I don't want

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:33.470
that's not my creep I don't want to use

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.880
our moon card because there is a chance

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.950
we can use it to get out of boss rush

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.530
although admittedly Lilith is pretty

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.630
good at boss rush but not as much with

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.160
the void instead of box of friend

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.550
specifically because of the extra charge

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:51.470
so on most rooms the void is going to be

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:54.010
preferable most floors I guess however

00:17:51.470 --> 00:18:00.710
on some not so much

00:17:54.010 --> 00:18:02.240
boss rush is a kind of a special case if

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.570
we want any chance of making it the boss

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:08.960
rush we need to I don't even want to say

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:12.440
go faster because I'm going as fast as I

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.450
feel is plausible but I am genuinely

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.740
trying okay we need a charge here

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:22.510
because that's obviously great oh why

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.510
are you gonna make me backtrack

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:28.400
hurts me deep in my soul we had the

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.980
right kind of metric there we can get

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.650
see a golden who might be worth a bomb

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.270
in a key really thought Cuba me was

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.820
going to get the job done we need BFF or

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.140
something if we're going to roll this or

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:42.049
little brim which could show up via

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.970
cambian Concepcion would help us avoid

00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:47.410
this problem as well and it's a tough

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.410
situation because you might just want to

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.700
avoid that or use a reroll to try to get

00:18:51.620 --> 00:19:01.460
something amazing I guess as a

00:18:52.700 --> 00:19:02.960
preferable option okay 17 minutes 20

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:11.929
seconds it might be time to say goodbye

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:17.260
to boss rush worth okay careful it's not

00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:17.260
even that great but it is good enough

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:24.700
zero point five damage and a slightly

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:30.559
better rate of fire should always this

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:31.760
crack it do this blow it up don't really

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:34.400
care about getting the effect of the

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.790
Bible but that's okay do this suck it

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.030
all up

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:40.400
what is this bad trip okay it doesn't

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.320
even hurt that bad so we can use this to

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.850
get the ability to fly and then probably

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.200
get a battery charge or have a chance to

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.419
get a battery charge out of that sack

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.799
it's not my ideal play here I think

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:51.350
instead I think we saved this for the

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:52.910
chance to meal whatever the boss item is

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.010
into something better or get something

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:57.020
from the shop but don't really want to

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.870
blow up our donation machine anymore

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:02.950
it's not like it's super low but we're

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.950
taking a lot out at once

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:16.730
yeah unnecessary still we're basically

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.190
unkillable from an HP standpoint so I'm

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.260
going to throw myself like headlong into

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.110
taking damage against these enemies

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:28.330
because it really sincerely is almost

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:34.010
impossible to kill us but also I need to

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:36.110
go faster not for any practical reason

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.700
other than if I don't I'm going to start

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:41.720
losing my mind with four damage here I

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:48.980
mean that's pretty good

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:51.080
I like kind of like that to be honest

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.760
with you and then I'm going to suck up

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.170
the Kiba meat and it became damaging

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.970
tears I'm the happiest man in the world

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.750
as far as I'm concerned why not take

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:01.340
brimstone I don't want to be first up

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.080
that room is already good enough I don't

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.610
need to insult the audience by taking an

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.350
item so overpowered it's going to make

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.910
it a no-brainer I think I play better

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:11.870
when I have to stay a little dialed in

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:13.570
anyway so but then beyond this I didn't

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.220
want to manage the brimstone beam a

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.720
pretty minor thing but and then why did

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:20.030
I suck up cubed meat that one's actually

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.280
completely sensible in my opinion second

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:25.340
level Quba meat is not that valuable as

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:29.210
compared to another chance at of

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:31.100
statistical gain as far as I'm concerned

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.370
we got a pretty good statistical game

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.370
there

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.950
we are not going to make boss rush I've

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.810
come to terms with this finally it's

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.340
taken me a while because when I say

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.200
we're not going to make boss rush in the

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:51.440
back of my head I'm like yeah but maybe

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:55.400
we will and even now I'm like but maybe

00:21:51.440 --> 00:22:08.770
we will even now I'm like but maybe we

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:10.040
will it had to be done jar of tears

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.770
Seraphim

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.180
I mean gimpy is great but we don't need

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.430
I'd rather have Seraphim for the extra

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.580
damage and to have a good double oh you

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:23.330
know what we didn't we're stupid idiots

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.800
and we didn't take the moon card in the

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.600
year which was the whole reason we even

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.590
held the moon card for longer than a

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:33.410
millisecond so now I got to fight these

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:35.060
guys the good news is probably going to

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.640
get another item and the other good news

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:41.570
is it's going to start to pop off pretty

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:44.240
fast because you know once we stack up

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:46.750
four or five farting babies like the

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.750
dream is real

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.080
for now though might be a little tedious

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.070
as we get started here and that's okay

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.740
you know what we should be using our

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:09.990
cubes of meat PSA's to do some extra

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:14.960
damage in here because every three waves

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:18.720
we're going to be getting at least two

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:22.980
hearts back anyway now we also have a

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:27.960
third level boy of meats and Garcon blue

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:29.610
jean ball as I've always said if we

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.870
could get triple-a battery we could do

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.000
it in two waves because we've already

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:36.780
got nine volt but you know let's not get

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.160
our hopes up too much you know what we

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.840
should actually be taking as much damage

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.310
as possible you're going to think I'm an

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.890
idiot but here's why I'm actually the

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.900
world's smartest man we want to take

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.940
damage because we're going to generate

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:55.560
enough HP to compensate for it and it's

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:56.000
free can being conception fuel he's done

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.380
it

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.380
Perales is not my favorite item but

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:14.720
we've actually ascended I'm making the

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.760
smartest decision I've ever made do I

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.620
see are those all Incubus no there's a

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.450
demon judgment or a demon baby in here

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:28.250
now so we came being conception to

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:31.370
ourselves a demon baby what are you

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:36.950
going to do we might as well take even

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:38.300
more damage right now like just get it

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:41.980
charged up as fast as possible I'm

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.980
trying to get to that little brim action

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:55.190
it's turned out surprisingly well

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:56.990
actually I don't know I think it takes

00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.470
like 20 hits to get a can being

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:04.400
conception payout so don't get your

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:05.840
hopes up too much but I mean even just

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:11.300
getting a demon baby that keeps getting

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:14.840
incremented it's pretty solid sharp

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:17.390
pencil that's pretty great as well

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.370
so we've the moon we could leave and

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:22.640
like maybe go to our shop but honestly

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:25.040
what does that matter at this point we

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.310
also have almost no reason to use the

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:30.140
void because we're outside of like

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:32.360
sucking up an item or milling for the

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:36.110
stat increase because we're already

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.850
pretty darn strong here it's nice to

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:41.840
have the Necronomicon I suppose and

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:44.180
again I mean if we wanted to to some

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:49.130
extent there's no reason not to like do

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:50.960
that you know like why not take if we're

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.780
about to get a charge or we already have

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.540
a charge and we're at full HP it's the

00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:00.550
right decision to get hit so that we can

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:03.170
generate extra kami consumption place I

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:04.610
don't think I've ever used cam bean

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:07.640
conception like this I've used it with

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.140
like IV bag but having the kind of HP

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.780
where you can just throw it away for no

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.260
reason that feels nice this would be a

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.630
great small rock

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:20.070
okay mom you know that yours can't be

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:22.559
choosers that's what they say so you

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:27.059
might as well hit me because you know

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:29.220
Kim being Concepcion don't really care

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:30.960
about a single golden chest although you

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.000
know there is a guppy chance you might

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.690
as well hit me as long as I'm getting

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.049
something out of being hit I am okay

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.049
with it

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:49.679
always find a new you know archetypes

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.720
for Isaac runs that basically make it

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:53.400
impossible for you to die I mean this

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.350
one is not really can being conception

00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:01.230
making it impossible for us to die it's

00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:05.910
void plus Book of Revelations and

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:07.380
Satanic Bible but still oh that was a

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.419
full charge I know there's a battery

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.309
charge back there anyway but you know

00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:14.610
it's kind of the the other thing about

00:27:11.309 --> 00:27:16.230
having infinite HP is that what do we

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.540
care about getting more than infinite HP

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.010
it doesn't go any higher

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:26.040
you know our wallet can only hold 12

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:28.559
hearts here it's not that way though

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.559
it's like almost definitely not that way

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:33.720
I didn't even like lampshade it that

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:37.410
much but that was like the greatest boss

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:39.419
rush entrance I've ever had as well it

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.370
really seemed impossible but a

00:27:39.419 --> 00:27:44.850
combination of convenient architecture

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:47.490
and like really going for it got the job

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:52.559
done it's a to charge room to charge

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:54.540
room to charge room to charge room so

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:58.440
again I'd probably voy to Cuba meet

00:27:54.540 --> 00:28:01.860
honestly which we will get the

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.770
opportunity to do right here first deal

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.630
with the devil no it's another damage

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:10.470
and shot speed increase let me get this

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:12.590
as well through that sneeze snuck up on

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:15.900
me more than any sneeze in recent memory

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:18.419
before I even knew it was upon me it was

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.860
already tickling the nostril there or

00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:23.309
before I'd even tickled the nostril it

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:25.520
was already exiting the nostril silent

00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:25.520
running

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.800
well you know you might as well shoot me

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:48.640
similarly you might as well hit me it's

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.480
weird what do you get for the man who

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.480
has everything right

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.290
we still have been generated a new kami

00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:04.600
conception pan I wonder if it's

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:07.810
staggered like is it the case that you

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:11.950
know every subsequent cambian conception

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:16.330
takes longer that would be completely

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:19.600
fair given that we're scamming the

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:24.490
system right now I would just be

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.870
surprised because I'm unaware but I

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.580
guess I shouldn't be surprised by my own

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.530
ignorance in this game at this point you

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:35.020
might as well hit me again please please

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:37.050
do oh you got me you're such a good dude

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:40.570
this game wow you're amazing

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:42.160
now I miscalculated actually because we

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.870
do want to save void for the deal with

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.610
the devil chance here but if we get hit

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.610
a little extra who cares

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:54.520
maybe some commenters and that's fair

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.490
because we shouldn't be throwing HP away

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.620
for no reason but now weirdly enough

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:02.560
despite having infinite HP it's not

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.840
really infinite HP at our desire you

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.420
know we require rooms to give us we just

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.340
want it obviously we were pardon me

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.630
require rooms to give us the infinite HP

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.660
which is why I'm not going to go to the

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:15.430
Hashi I are damages even with the you

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.270
know horror Babylon here is not even

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.270
that amazing

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:26.529
get out of here and I think I'll check

00:30:24.879 --> 00:30:31.570
this as well you know what we should

00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:33.789
have just used our void play for that

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.609
but I'm just going to do that right

00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:39.539
there looking for the battery charge

00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:43.749
there we go like we're not that

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:47.369
overpowered is what I'm saying we really

00:30:43.749 --> 00:30:52.330
require small rooms to get the job done

00:30:47.369 --> 00:30:55.840
okie dokie I mean we want to take damage

00:30:52.330 --> 00:31:02.289
more or less we might as well walk over

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:03.759
the spikes remember I think we forget

00:31:02.289 --> 00:31:07.960
sometimes you know we get to up our

00:31:03.759 --> 00:31:09.340
butts about min maxing and Isaac some

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:13.799
min max seems important but I think we

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:17.919
forget that it's not always just about

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:18.869
like beating the game in the best way

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:21.009
possible

00:31:18.869 --> 00:31:24.909
sometimes it's about having fun while

00:31:21.009 --> 00:31:27.669
you do it like I enjoy the concept of

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:30.519
finishing a run with high morale maybe

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:31.629
we could have maximized the amount of

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:33.580
spirit hearts lost

00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:35.409
minimized rather the amount of spirit

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.720
hearts lost and you know there's there's

00:31:35.409 --> 00:31:41.529
some academic miss and that that I

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.970
appreciate but at the same time I like

00:31:41.529 --> 00:31:44.499
using Kela me to destroy all these

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.200
enemies I don't think too many people

00:31:44.499 --> 00:31:48.729
are disagreeing with me there but

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:54.700
although it does feel sloppy it's also

00:31:48.729 --> 00:31:58.690
you know you're asking Bill Gates why he

00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:00.399
left a $20 tip on a $20 meal you know

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.720
that's 100 percent tip Bill Gates you're

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:03.669
making the rest of us look bad and

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.590
reinforcing a culture in North America

00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:07.239
that is a little bit controversial with

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.070
people from outside of North America and

00:32:07.239 --> 00:32:10.539
then Bill Gates says you know in the

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:14.019
time that would have taken me to punch

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:18.129
in a different number I made 20 times

00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:22.830
that so it's irrelevant you know we've

00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:25.050
got such large amounts of HP

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.790
we're basically the Bill Gates of Isaac

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:29.010
right now I was another charge wasted

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:31.350
but again sort of like kind of what I'm

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:36.750
getting at who cares feels like I'm

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:38.490
walking on sunshine but we shouldn't do

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.790
that we shouldn't use the charge first

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:43.410
because that puts us in an imbalance

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:45.330
verb dude I totally forgot we had

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:47.310
trinkets melter like a second run in a

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:49.290
row where we've had well second run with

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:55.950
trinkets melter in a row where we gotta

00:32:49.290 --> 00:33:00.450
know daniel smelled things going on it's

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:06.870
a darn shame this run hit critical mass

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:08.910
though great name for a hipster bar that

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.710
has arcade machines give it a shot

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:14.450
I'm not going to sue you or anything if

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:17.390
you make it I am see you in court

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:21.030
see you in bud courts court my favorite

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:23.130
television courtroom okay so we got to

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:28.740
think about this we have voice I want

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:31.260
this you never want to D six with void

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.520
I've been yelled at for it many times I

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.050
don't even understand what's wrong with

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.990
it but I understand that it's wrong it's

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:40.460
kind of like you know I know you

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:45.540
shouldn't consume like castor beans

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:47.250
they're poisonous I don't know what they

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.590
do to your body but I know we shouldn't

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:51.840
be consuming them but that means that

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:54.000
I'm gonna void it because I think at

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.110
this point unless it breaks the game we

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:03.060
should be fine I was looking for another

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:06.650
room that I could deposit the d6 in but

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.650
I think this is this is better

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:16.930
there's a chest back here I mean you can

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:18.550
suck up Book of Shadows but what do you

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:21.010
get for the man who has everything right

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:23.110
we've already got unlimited HP do we

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:27.490
need to be invincible as well kind of

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:31.050
starting to approach madness you know

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:34.750
Albert Einstein famously said madness is

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.920
doing this ain't one sanity is doing the

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:40.750
same thing and expecting different

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:42.910
results this kind of flies in the face

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.950
of the scientific method one important

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:47.020
element of which is repeatability but in

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:48.670
any case you know it's all politics when

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.230
you try to get published so he was

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.090
probably just trying to come up with a

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:54.750
phrase that got the journal review

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:57.580
editors on his side but either way I

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.110
think madness is when you got infinite

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.040
resources and you're still worried about

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:04.330
penny pinching you know it's always nice

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.820
your story's about like Warren Buffett

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:08.830
he's a billionaire you won't pay more

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.420
than like six dollars for a sandwich but

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.610
I bet you know it makes us feel like

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.930
we're close to them you know because

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.270
we're like that everybody wants to think

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.650
like that's what I'd be like if I was in

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.480
its position and maybe that's the case

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:21.660
but I bet there's been times where

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:24.520
Warren Buffett like went out for lunch

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:27.970
went out for lunch went out for lunch

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.740
with like the super-rich I made up that

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.930
story about not paying more than $6 for

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.760
a sandwich by the way but you know let's

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.110
go to this place so hundred dollars a

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.030
plate and Warren Buffett's like not

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.530
going to do it you know the time that

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.390
you argued the dinner is paid for itself

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.760
a hundred times over war and fictional

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:45.550
Warren Buffett why are you being such a

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.110
jerk because we're trying to get

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:49.720
together to discuss important business

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:53.440
matters you're adhering to this foolish

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:56.620
principle it's ignorant of the economics

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.630
of the situation we should have black

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:01.830
room bad but I have a faith that we'll

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.830
get some more items anyway

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:11.359
nine lives we should take there's a very

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:16.190
very very small chance we can become

00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:18.260
guffy still never tell me the odds you

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.410
know what I disagree always tell me the

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.410
odds

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.820
okay we shouldn't take three is in quick

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.710
succession there we don't have permanent

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.940
Polaroid invincibility anymore we don't

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:32.070
even know what our HP looks like anymore

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.920
we could actually be in a tighter spot

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:37.350
that we expect if we are and we die we

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.860
really really deserve to if we're being

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.860
honest

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:50.180
I black ruin to SMB superfan and I'm

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.500
going to tell you the reason why but you

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:57.590
have to promise to not be mad at me

00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:01.310
because it's a bad reason I thought in

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:03.920
my head maybe I can black ruin SMB

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:06.320
superfans and it will become a guppy

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.920
item you might be saying how would that

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.450
happen

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.300
see that's the exact same question I

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:20.120
asked myself mere moments after doing

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:24.620
that because it can't but if it could

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:25.730
have it would have been sweet but we're

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.800
going to win here I'm going to win in

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:31.430
pretty good time considering how badly

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:33.050
this oh I didn't even see the portal

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.970
until we had already gone into the chest

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.650
we could have done in delirium there but

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.270
we didn't so don't give me the credit

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.290
for it for now thanks for watching hope

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.400
