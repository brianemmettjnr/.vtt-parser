00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.210
hey everybody welcome acting on the land

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.799
please the binding of issac after birth

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.509
plus we're straight up I've been playing

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.649
like garbage lately so if you're going

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.030
through hell keep going we're gonna do

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.250
some keeper runs here to try to make

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.710
this work you know what believe in we

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.849
why not why not give it a try right look

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.900
at that we win

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:25.350
now we win as a result of this t13 e fw

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.810
k i firmly believe in my my limited

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.179
experience you know i'm not a sports

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.920
psychologist or god forbid any sports

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.719
psychologists or anything like that not

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.100
that I'm looking down on eSports to be a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.030
little bit you know pot calling the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.760
kettle black here but all I'm saying is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.539
I'm not a sports psychologist if you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.239
know you're 70 million dollar contract

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.219
pitcher you know he's got the yips what

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.420
do you do I don't know what I do know

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.160
this is a little silly that we've

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.940
whipped three times in a row on this but

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.439
what I do know is that for me personally

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.299
seems like the best option is to keep

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.760
going you know actually it

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.070
counter-intuitively give yourself a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.450
difficult run and then if you succeed

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
it'll feel like you got back on the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.200
horse you know oh dude speed up is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.460
Street extremely good and then the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.430
piercing shots of course speak for

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.750
themselves but so we're gonna do a run

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.310
as the hardest character in the game I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.900
think that this is pretty much doubtless

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.610
although hey don't you think that maybe

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.290
Judas or apollyon are the hardest

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.860
characters haha oh the roasting okay no

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.740
those I mean I don't think I lost one

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.509
runs apollyon maybe the second one you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.460
know it went down too early for us to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.259
know but certainly I'm still like you

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.149
feel like you shouldn't lose three runs

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.140
in a row at this point in your eyes and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.509
career so what do you do remind yourself

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.229
that you actually can play pretty well

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.850
you know be the keeper win a run all day

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.140
long you'll have good fun that's what

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.299
the hell is your grandma ever tell you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.939
that be the keeper winner run all day

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.629
long you'll have good fun I've taught

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.610
that for years dude and a speed upgrade

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.410
you might think this is disappointing to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.710
me you would be incorrect I actually

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.360
think that it is excellent we needed I

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.310
don't really want to worry about getting

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.570
a five cents before the next floor if we

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.640
could do it without incurring too much

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.160
risk as long as we didn't get hit twice

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.960
on the first room we went to but why

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.300
invite that sort of evil into our lives

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.480
for a 50% chance to have a chance to get

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.800
an arcade seems like a bit of a pipe

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.840
dream Aquarius is okay it is going to do

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.860
an adequate job of you know hurting some

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.290
enemies who are trying to take us down

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.050
gotta shoot these petrified who provides

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.970
some value I also I always always always

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.970
have to remind myself as the keeper

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.910
there's no reason most of the time not

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:03.390
to go to the shop so you just this is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.780
like the exact scenario that better safe

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.710
than sorry was invented for take your

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.320
time to push that thing over don't like

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.550
fighting enemies on secret rooms I think

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.030
we should open it because we don't have

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.230
anything else to do with our keys you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.450
know we don't need to use them to get to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.340
the shop as as indicated we should be

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.230
using head of the keeper not head of the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.170
keeper but uh wouldn't nickel more often

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.080
I see the stopwatch in there and I'm

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.290
looking and I'm liking to quote Ben

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:41.280
Stiller from the 2004 classic Meet the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:45.360
Fockers if we can get to it's pretty

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.180
unlikely but if we can get to 15 cents

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.550
the stopwatch would well actually it's

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.800
not as valuable as I'm giving a credit

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.870
for right now old stopwatch would be

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.600
amazing existing stopwatch which means

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.370
you know if you get hit once you get the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.920
stopwatch effect it would be helpful

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.239
it's like a nice way to ensure that you

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.260
know we're less likely to get hit a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.880
second time after getting here once but

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.530
far from compulsory I'd say maybe we're

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.290
better off just saving our money so the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.160
deal with the devil we should be only

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.680
taking if there's something that can uh

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.880
you know it's tough

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.449
and it's tough because we could take

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.699
multi-dimensional baby at least in

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.620
theory and then get HP but I'm going to

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.690
choose not to do that for two reasons

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.729
one is if I touch the spikes I will die

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.530
and this run you know we're two floors

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.840
in I don't think it's disposable anymore

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.580
not on that level at least I would I

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
would feel bad if I died on this run I

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.020
guess is what I'm saying

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.039
Sagittarius is decent upgrade okay okay

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.169
okay

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.870
and the other thing is angel rooms have

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:57.600
been a buff so I kind of feel like this

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.490
week I owe it to myself to see if that's

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840
actually a meaningful difference or if

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.810
it's just like something that's more

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.190
conceptual or you know in theory angel

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.720
rooms are better but actually they're

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.220
still largely fairly bad I have a

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.669
feeling they're actually you know

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.770
markedly better so I'm quite happy about

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.639
that perfect timing to get a key thank

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:23.669
you very much and honestly we've got a

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.680
good foundation right now 2020 shouldn't

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.750
affect our rate of fire which means that

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.340
it should be excellent because we should

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.930
be shooting five shots yet instead of

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.550
three and I don't know if they're

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.960
tightly bunched or if they're more

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.560
tightly bunched than they used to be but

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.289
they cover the same spread with more

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:45.090
shots which to me means more damage per

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:52.349
per barrage here for lack of a better

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:54.360
word so I'm happy with that to be honest

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.760
with you a wrath fight when we're low on

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.940
bombs doesn't bother me too much

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.580
we don't want mr. boom but I appreciate

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.650
the the offer regardless so the next big

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.120
thing for us is I mean obviously if we

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.240
can find a way to get swallowed penny

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.860
sweet if we can find out just you know

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.020
you kind of nipped me in the bud there

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.460
but I was just about to say like the

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.870
shop is extremely important if we can

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.159
get nun's habit or something like that

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.830
I'll be a very happy camper I think it's

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:29.250
fairly unrealistic for us to not take

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.370
damage you know of course in a perfect

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.370
world that would be awesome we don't

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.340
live in a perfect world as the keeper

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.900
although the run has been great

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.480
so far so I'm not going to complain too

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.220
hard so seven cents for five bombs is

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.630
like just on its own merits I think that

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.260
that's an acceptable deal let's take

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.940
that move along here we could use like

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.130
four of those bombs if we wanted to try

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.040
to get that golden chest for you but

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.180
let's stay away for now so the big thing

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.050
on this floor now again if we're not

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.280
going to get the trinket and we're not

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.010
going to get none sabot which is very

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.889
clear at least for the nun's habit what

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.330
we are best off looking for here is like

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.510
the nine percent chance to get a deal

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.280
and it's like a four and a half I was

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:14.380
really dumb of me four and a half

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.870
percent chance to get the deal with the

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.220
angel let's take the pill now it feels

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.040
like I'm walking on sunshine we've been

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.180
better off here but that's fine

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:27.370
the good thing about doing a keeper run

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:30.100
when it's like not a daily then we got

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.570
like a you know seven percent chance now

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.479
it's like a five point seven five

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.590
percent chance of getting a deal with

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.150
the angel here as long as you don't get

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.539
hit and the hollow is like the perfect

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:43.000
boss to get completely shat on by

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:44.500
piercing shots so you know we got these

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.530
vanilla Doritos here they're doing a

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.240
good job I'll take it but mostly it's

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.770
four shot speed purposes at this point

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.770
I'm happy we're still alive but we need

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:58.479
a little bit more but I'm starting to

00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:02.500
believe don't make me reroll well this

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:05.680
money potential here glad we moved at

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:09.389
least before we use that yeah

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:13.030
okay so locus of conquest could be great

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:14.560
wow it's big whoops there we got enough

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.970
money to feel okay about it now we

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:21.310
actually need to pay attention to our

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:22.690
keys but the idea is the locust is

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.240
guaranteed damage

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.190
I think guaranteed damage once per room

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:32.020
on the floor is worth way more than one

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:33.789
key so I'm all about that and I'll

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.719
apologize if it seems like I'm all

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:40.330
business right now I just have had a bad

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:42.760
run of form and Isaac lately you know

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.560
you know you and me and I'm talking

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.839
about you know the Royal you at this

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.820
point we've been around the block we've

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:49.840
gone through Isaac ups and downs

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.170
any of you were probably here for that

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.390
like 115 streak many of you have been

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.210
here through some terrible play

00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:02.740
there's ebbs and flows in in my Isaac's

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:05.200
series I go through areas of consistency

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.900
and then inconsistency without usually

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.490
as there is you know we come back to a

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:15.130
certain level of like not optimal but at

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:18.760
least decent play you just got to kind

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:21.460
of ride it I think it's you got to like

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.400
lean into a slump I understand a slump

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.970
I've slumped at times in my life I don't

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.450
think there's any shame in that all it

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:33.580
takes is you know bad dice roll combined

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.200
with bad play lowers your

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.730
self-confidence a little bit and all of

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.890
a sudden you're like you know why maybe

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.270
I'm just I've lost my mojo in this game

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.210
and I think that that's you know you get

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:45.510
into some self-defeating psychology

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:50.080
that's that's unhealthy

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:51.880
what I do is I accept the slump and then

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.970
I go how do we beat this and I think the

00:09:51.880 --> 00:10:01.810
way you beat it is by forcing your own

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:04.480
hand at least in Isaac I don't know I'm

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:07.720
not gonna if the Red Sox want to hire me

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:11.230
come and talk to me Theo Epstein Epstein

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.990
I don't know I mean it's not win Ben

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.430
Stein's money I'll give you that that

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:18.310
was not a smart play on my part

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:23.290
especially because we need keys to go to

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:26.410
the everywhere I'm gonna have to pick

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:28.270
that up if I we can take damage and then

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.970
pick it up and get no penny out of it

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.830
but feel like we used it properly or we

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.710
could just pick it up and then try not

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.820
to take damage over the rest of this

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.110
yeah we eat keys because we haven't been

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.720
to our item room and we haven't been to

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:44.530
our shop yet we could always walk back

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:48.000
for shop key but what about me makes you

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:48.000
think that I'm that kind of player

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:56.120
it's a long walk there we go one key

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:59.300
first key I might just use it for the

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:08.480
item room I know we've already of the

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:13.220
second key nice dodge brain it's like a

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:17.600
lot of matrix math to do here to figure

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.379
out where it's safe to stand but it was

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.670
really good

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:22.490
see I was worried about coming into the

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:25.100
shop and having the shop be greed

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.199
thankfully it's not cherry it's pretty

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.850
good it's a better deal chance now we'll

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:31.370
go back and with two keys we can

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:35.689
definitely afford to go to our item room

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:36.889
in the item room is HP up in theory we

00:11:35.689 --> 00:11:38.120
shouldn't have taken this quite yet

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:40.189
because we could get a deal with the

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.089
devil that gives us something great that

00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:46.939
costs us HP we don't want to do that the

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:50.029
chance of it being catastrophic is way

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:55.660
way way too high to justify it but I'm

00:11:50.029 --> 00:11:55.660
still banking on this angel chance here

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:02.240
stigmata by the way not the most amazing

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.230
damage upgrade but everything helps

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.089
especially considering it's like

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.850
multiplied by five right now because of

00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:14.029
the number of shots we got coming out of

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:17.949
our brain ROM mega it's actually like a

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:20.569
tempting use of the chariot card I think

00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:23.240
you don't have the luxury of using those

00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:25.490
cards like the way you want to you have

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.740
to use them the way you have to we're

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:32.000
going to take this moms pearls for a

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:36.410
luck upgrade nun's habit okay and then

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.569
please give me keys he's done it go back

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:42.740
to the well ah okay we're done and

00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:44.689
dusted I don't think we want to fight

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:47.569
the angel statue although that would be

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:52.309
very hilarious if we were able to kill

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:53.800
uh mega Satan I'm going to just throw

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:57.170
that on the backburner

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.970
so we got negative one luck but what we

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.130
do have now is nun's habit nuns have it

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.740
is like a plus forty percent chance to

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.800
win any

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:09.120
give and run so you can see them on TV

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.890
any given run day when the keeper run

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.150
and drive off in a Hyundai actually

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.900
thank you for bringing it up but I do

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.670
Drive us

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:18.300
Ford Focus it's not a Hyundai it's a

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:21.480
Ford Focus thinking about slapping some

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.040
sick decals on it you know like one

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.710
that's just like Isaac's face and I'll

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.890
be like this cars got a speed upgrade

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:30.600
and then at a stoplight I'll look at you

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:36.720
in the face and they'll go right here

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:39.330
that's not how that engine sounds but it

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:43.650
is like it's a 1 liter so it's killing

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:45.270
it you know I've already taken one hit

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:49.110
on this room let's take these jokers out

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:51.390
I understand a 1 liter is not a

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.490
particularly fast automobile but I'm not

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.170
Tracy Chapman I don't need a fast car I

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:59.810
just need something reliable in the city

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.810
and the gas mileage is out of this world

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.290
all I need now is a bumper sticker of

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.740
Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes like

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:13.200
peeing on another cars logo to justify

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.990
you know or strengthen my feelings of

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.480
making the correct purchase I don't know

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:22.920
what who'd afford owners hate I'm

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:25.290
relying on you for this one makes me

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.150
laugh like I grew up in this is probably

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:31.020
not that specific to my area but I grew

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:34.020
up in a pretty rural area so even when

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.180
we were like you know 10 years old that

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:39.060
was so stupid

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.680
but we did get a golden bond we would

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.750
have like arguments on the playground

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.520
and be like Chevy's better than Ford

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.480
it's like you've never driven a car

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.870
before in your life

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.360
nah-uh my dad let me pull it into the

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.130
driveway once and the power you can feel

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.790
from that engine is just incredible you

00:14:53.130 --> 00:15:00.030
know we we'd have arguments about it

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:01.980
we had no idea what I still do this day

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.830
don't know you know what I'm looking for

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:08.190
in a car on a regular basis actually

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:10.650
like sometimes I research like which

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.330
restaurant I want to go to for a special

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.160
occasion more than I research the car

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.360
that I've actually purchased you know

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.310
with my own

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.040
a year I'm not suggesting that that's a

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.329
good course of action in fact quite the

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.610
opposite I'm just going back for a

00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:27.120
little HP here because this run is

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:32.910
looking a little scary now please tell

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:34.680
me yes well worth the key but really

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.120
like we went in and we're let's look at

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.940
some colors what are you looking for I

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:43.250
don't know I would like it to be

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:47.430
reliable and not super expensive and

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:50.220
then we test-drove like the focus and I

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:52.829
was like this is a car this feels like

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.170
it's a car and then we bought it

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:56.550
sometimes you know I'll be like you want

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.399
to go to that restaurant no I'm not

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:01.500
really feeling Belgian food tonight

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:03.630
mmm what kind of you'd call and inquire

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:10.829
as to when their muscles for the moules

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:12.269
frites were cut are they like the most

00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:14.040
yuppie thing I've ever said are there

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:18.060
personal shoppers for cars I guess it's

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.170
like the Internet so I've made a

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.029
cardinal mistake you should never

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.050
solicit vehicle advice on the internet

00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:23.250
because you're going to feel very

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:27.120
self-conscious about your

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:29.070
decision-making process already I know

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.570
as soon as I bought the focus people

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.690
were like you should have gotten a Mazda

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:43.610
3 and now every time I see a Mazda 3 I'm

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:47.970
like I should I can't get to see you

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:52.440
thinking of the implication the daddy to

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:55.589
be okay 6g p yd w CQ or you go for it I

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:58.949
mean the thing is how could I not go for

00:16:55.589 --> 00:17:02.490
it you know that run was fine

00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:04.470
I played okay where did we wisp

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.910
well I mean I hate that we got nine volt

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:12.679
none seven and still lost but basically

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:16.199
we got hit by you know a shot from a

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:18.569
random sprinkler basically and that cost

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:19.980
us the game so I do feel like we whipped

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:23.130
on that one but I don't feel like it's a

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.500
colossal failure you creep shots are

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.610
okay you do have to give it up for

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:31.560
unicorn Stumpf to an extent but

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.560
doesn't really fit the run right now

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.630
anyway

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.480
yeah not believe it or not I'm not too

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:45.370
bummed about that one like I think it

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.810
said not altogether terrible do you want

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.700
to grab all the money that's available

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:52.360
here and this I was hoping would be a

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:54.580
special shop it's not a battery baby

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.660
versus re-rolling your item rooms these

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.710
are the kind of interesting questions

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:01.180
you find yourself getting into on a on a

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:05.950
keeper run you want to take battery baby

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:07.990
or do you want to but we might not be

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.060
able to do either so don't get your

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.860
hopes up too much but given the choice

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.000
we want to put money into the reroll

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:18.130
machine possibly getting something

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.280
useful for cheaper or you want battery

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:24.100
baby which occasionally might save us

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:28.690
the run probably unlikely to be that

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:30.550
good but we need more money first though

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.080
so let's you know again don't get too

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:35.890
attached to it first off we could use

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.180
the bomb to get a better chance of

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.800
getting something from our reroll

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.910
machine we could also use the bomb for

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.740
gain in the secret room getting enough

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.240
money to buy battery baby we use a lot

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.200
of money to buy battery baby you know if

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.730
we're lucky enough to make that

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.500
situation come to fruition we have a

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.970
serious problem though because you know

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.290
we can't get an arcade on the next floor

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.620
do we even won an arcade in the next

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.880
floor I don't know it gives you HP when

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.530
you walk into it you could maybe get a

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.730
free speed upgrade buy a blood bag or

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.950
something like that and we already just

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.270
got a free speed upgrade so you know

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:05.980
it's like I don't know at this point

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:07.450
what I'm supposed to do so this is our

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.250
secret room I think we should use our

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.050
bomb here I think it gives us more

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.730
flexibility in our next decision making

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:15.340
process we got six cents for it that

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:17.080
beats the average so step two is then

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.120
you put two cents into this thing up to

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.010
two cents into this thing you get homing

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.660
tears that's amazing and then we still

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:25.810
have enough money to buy battery baby

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.460
that's Enel luck and you know what I'm

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.110
not going to apologize for that was

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.910
pretty sweet battery baby still might

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:33.700
not be that good but giving us the

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:36.070
occasional charge might pay for itself

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.140
pretty quickly here so grab that get the

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:42.130
heck out of town

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:47.860
how do I feel about homing tears I'm

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:49.000
like exactly neutral on them but like

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.610
when that's not fair

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.679
I'm positive on them but perhaps like

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:55.840
not as positive as I was about a lot of

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:59.620
the items we had early on in our last

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.510
run but if it helps with our ability to

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.980
aim with triple shot that I'm all for it

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.170
I shouldn't be negative homing tears is

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.000
a great item that I usually want to have

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:09.160
so we have an easy get-out-of-jail-free

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.179
card here that will probably give us an

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.010
undo chance to win this run we now have

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:16.510
the ability to respawn and will respond

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.510
with double whatever our damage is

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:24.429
although will also not have triple shot

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:26.020
I assume but I'm going to try to win it

00:20:24.429 --> 00:20:27.750
as the keeper if we have to become dark

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.620
Judas then that's fine

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.270
I'm going to play this deal with the

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.890
devil unless it's like a very special

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:38.770
circumstance I'm going to play this deal

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:40.450
with the devil as if it's you play this

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.290
deal with the devil as if it's the

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.620
keeper and we have no

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.850
get-out-of-jail-free card assuming we

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:49.630
get to deal with the devil because if we

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:55.090
get hit we almost certainly will not yes

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:57.669
the fire yes and then this fire no this

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.080
way yeah under out you almost had it

00:20:57.669 --> 00:21:01.690
there you almost tricked me into

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:09.760
extinguishing it yet yes so and so there

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:12.400
you go give me HP and then like a one

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:16.840
heart amazing deal that's what I want I

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:19.000
want damage I want to kick the crap out

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.090
of this run see like that doesn't help

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.460
us really we could be dark Judas and

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:27.460
make this happen I guess old bandage I'm

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:30.480
assuming will drop flies for us when we

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:33.549
get hit sometimes might be useful on the

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.290
on a blood bank sort of situation but I

00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:38.370
did choose not to go to the shop on the

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:41.630
last floor probably a bad decision but

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:44.250
I'm looking to keep good pace here

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:47.100
hematemesis it's actually not that bad

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:56.010
we got flies out of it and again like

00:21:47.100 --> 00:22:05.480
the benefit of having the reroll thank

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:09.360
you battery baby little scary come on

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:17.490
how many unsuccessful plays you're going

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:25.080
to give me here yeah I nearly screwed

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:27.840
that up massively there we go perfect

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.309
timing we will want to go to this room

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.440
shop library

00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:35.280
who cares good bad I'm the one with a

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.350
gun we could always blow that we don't

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.980
have any bombs still it's the right

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.630
decision to blow this up get a coin back

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.400
I almost walked into the fire right

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.750
after that we don't need the key is we

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.880
don't need the battery charge yet at

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:53.120
least so this like now it was room

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.840
interesting interesting

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.840
wow that was fast

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:12.030
IV bag generates like a ton of flies for

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:13.280
us I hate my life how could that are you

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:17.270
kidding me man

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:20.610
IV bag not given us a coin when we have

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:25.440
when we have IV bag it's a little rude

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:29.400
isn't it also like I would have I was

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.530
considering rolling IV bag long term but

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.309
like I mean you can see the problem with

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:37.080
that it didn't give us many flies we're

00:23:35.309 --> 00:23:40.890
looking for flies because we have old

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.090
bandage we have blank card a was old

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.530
bandage by the way normally gives you

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.600
red hearts sometimes when you get hit

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:49.050
but it gives us flies as the keeper

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:51.320
because the keeper cannot take red

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.320
hearts

00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:58.710
come on this is getting a little silly

00:23:56.309 --> 00:24:00.659
here um just keep moving just keep

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.360
moving so now instead we're going to you

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:04.649
know hold this eihwaz room the idea is

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.669
that the eihwaz room is kind of a

00:24:04.649 --> 00:24:07.669
get-out-of-jail-free card

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:11.850
but also we could use it to get out of

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.080
boss rush which is better than getting

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.850
out of jail because we're not in jail in

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.399
the first place although we are locked

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.570
into boss rush I'm not locked in there

00:24:17.399 --> 00:24:20.549
with them they're locked in there with

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.679
me is what I like to say so we're going

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:24.630
to just say no thank you dad a miner

00:24:22.679 --> 00:24:27.929
said my piece on that item

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:30.149
I think it's borderline zany not

00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:34.409
borderline terrible it's genuinely

00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:38.760
terrible oh it was a little close we're

00:24:34.409 --> 00:24:41.070
in dire need of some damage really makes

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:45.480
me you know long for the conditions of

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:48.840
last Ronnie but homing tears do they

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:53.010
make it plausible to do more with the

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:57.230
damage we have so I'm certainly you know

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:57.230
very for homing fears right now

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.620
battery baby it's kind of a I don't

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:08.179
think I've ever thought of this as a

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:13.850
keeper synergy but I can't deny that

00:25:08.179 --> 00:25:17.270
it's doing decent work we've got a

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:19.640
fairly poor deal chance here not that

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:22.790
I'm suggesting you know we deserve a

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:25.059
better deal chance' to take some damage

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:28.730
on this floor got myself into some

00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:31.549
situations I wasn't super pleased with I

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:35.990
hate to use my last bomb to do that but

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:37.700
honestly it was the right call basically

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.730
I got a hamstrung there and I had to

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.870
take to the nickel to get out but again

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.400
you could either get hit and ruin your

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.049
deviled eel chance and then pick it up

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.450
anyway I only get four cents or you can

00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:49.010
pick up five cents on your dodge and

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.630
just be thankful for having the

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:57.140
opportunity to pick up five cents in the

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:59.600
first place so now Cuba meat is a

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.950
dangerous proposition here but it's one

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:06.200
that I'm happy to have let's head

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:08.210
downwards worst-case scenario we could

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.470
always use and this is you know we're

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:13.400
getting a little late in the game here

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:17.510
can you stone not really what I want it

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:21.160
but we could always use a little little

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:26.059
on the close side there a was to skip

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:28.280
the womb one or something like it you

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:34.370
know save us a little bit of time save

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:38.000
us a little bit of hassle and push us in

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:39.650
a good direction so our triple shot

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.320
kidney stone is going to be disgustingly

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.850
good as you can see I mean I'm going to

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.770
annoy you with this but I'm probably

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:48.860
going to use my Cuba meat from time to

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:51.290
time small rock would be lovely here

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.570
even with the speed downgrade I would be

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.860
happy to take it in a heartbeat we

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.020
didn't get it obviously but I'm still

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.400
talking about it so that's how exciting

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.429
would be dude we needed that it Sears

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.630
upgrade is not in terms of its magnitude

00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:04.630
is not that meaningful

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:20.150
but in terms of its I needed that as

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:22.980
well come on charge it up bit of a whiff

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:29.160
like - - to our tears delay is not that

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:32.280
incredible but you know what I'll take

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.350
it I'll take a d6 room right here if you

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:42.870
want to give me one yeah that's what I

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:44.670
thought you scared or something well now

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:49.400
that we've taken a hit there's still

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.400
good reasons not to use a cube of meat

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:55.860
but there's less good reasons not to use

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:57.240
cube of meat especially if you've got

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.410
anything backing us up you know what I

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.530
don't like dealing with these guys in

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:05.340
the corner just handle it the way nature

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:11.520
intended I almost died there let that be

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:12.830
a lesson paralysis pill dude super

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.680
bummer

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:18.390
good dodge is okay keys

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.540
bomb you got to check this first just in

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:23.970
case into two of diamonds it's not then

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:35.310
you buy this sack of sax great item

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:37.850
great item we have no more bombs that's

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.850
okay

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.730
keep moving Sackett sex can do a lot of

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.170
work for you 15 cents allows you to buy

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:52.230
another item you know it's you know

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:54.510
going to be possible keep exercising

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.910
your constitutional right to use that

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:59.460
Cuba meet preferably without dying in

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:03.000
the process would be okay well you know

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:06.840
at some point you got to take personal

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.920
responsibility here don't jump don't

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:15.120
jump it's a bad time for you to jump

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:17.880
we've got to get ourselves together and

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:25.260
get on Sam stuff doing them as a clump

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:30.660
and we can't get out of it no we're

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:33.720
going to get out of it British bulldogs

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:36.360
gonna win whether he wants to or not so

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:40.530
I've now is the time this is our like

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:42.060
come to Jesus moment we should not use a

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:46.530
cube of meat anymore

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:48.360
I know 4.20 damage makes you think that

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.520
the cube of meat is the right play and

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.410
if we had a hundred percent efficacy on

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.050
our dodges you'd be right I mean I'm

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.670
still using it like as I say that I

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:59.070
shouldn't use it so that should tell you

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.870
something about the compelling power of

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:05.640
the the Cuba meat which is actually a

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:08.010
ball advantages but I don't like a

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.310
temperance card at this point I'm just

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.310
offended

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.070
shouldn't have pick that up but I saw 15

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:22.490
cents in my my sites and I took the

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:27.980
chance let's go okay

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:29.960
rah mega do it again wait for some

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:36.260
battery baby charges you don't really

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:39.790
want to be aggro on this guy with with

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:46.280
ball advantages at least like that's

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:49.370
potentially okay dark judas i forgot

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:53.750
about dark judas okay we're back let's

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:57.679
do this this is completely fine I mean

00:30:53.750 --> 00:31:01.460
it was a poor play but rah mega like

00:30:57.679 --> 00:31:03.830
base damage keeper it's a bit tricky to

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:08.390
begin with right now we got some actual

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:10.160
fuel for the fire we got some damage I

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.809
mean it's only seven damage rate of fire

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.300
is good though you don't have triple

00:31:11.809 --> 00:31:16.670
shop and honestly triple shot is uh it's

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:19.340
questionable whether that's actually a

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.929
positive to begin with really wanted

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.970
some HP but bellybuttons fine we don't

00:31:20.929 --> 00:31:25.030
really want that um can we get that

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:31.150
stuff no okay

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:31.150
now we can replace our space bar item I

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:39.740
almost never great shot there I almost

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:41.870
never use the wooden nickel as any

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:48.080
character but the keeper that doesn't

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:49.880
mean it's bad and this is our boss rush

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.530
attempt as well honestly if we managed

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.200
to win this one as dark Judas I'll

00:31:51.530 --> 00:32:01.670
consider it a I'll consider it in the

00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:05.540
win column as well parrot so I got we

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:07.820
need HP if we get HP you know the idea

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.040
we definitely would like to have demons

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.050
tail the idea is that HP is the be-all

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.790
end-all right now our damage is okay and

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:18.230
you know we have a hundred percent deal

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:19.340
chance so it's a pretty likely scenario

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.150
that we will improve our damage

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:24.020
throughout this run

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.910
trying to keep my eyes out for the

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.160
Invisible Man but it's not as easy as

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:29.600
you might expect so you leave the

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.309
battery charged on the ground just in

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:36.260
case you manage to grab like a nail or

00:32:31.309 --> 00:32:38.780
something okay

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:41.840
good feels like I'm walking on sunshine

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:43.730
also completely fine now we can get out

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:50.960
of the mindset as well of like we have

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:53.210
to use our we have to use the Wooden

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.559
Nickel when we like leave or when we

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:58.370
enter a room is what I meant to say

00:32:54.559 --> 00:33:01.700
there kidney stone is such a weird item

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:04.040
to evaluate like I have no idea how good

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:08.960
it is for us what I do know is that like

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:14.030
when I managed to get it to work on an

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:15.320
enemy they're dead you hear me and we

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.600
shouldn't have tried to make that dodge

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.380
work but and then we got hit at the very

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.919
end of all places what do you got for me

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:26.150
golden chest

00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:28.070
not that tempting so how do we die here

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.890
that's important to think about we die

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.059
if I mean if we get a nasty room to

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:39.049
begin with we might find ourselves in

00:33:32.059 --> 00:33:42.290
times of trouble we die if we have a

00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:46.940
better chance of dying if our shop has

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:50.030
greed in it we win if demons tale starts

00:33:46.940 --> 00:34:01.669
to pay out I'll take it you know I like

00:33:50.030 --> 00:34:09.379
14 damage a glass still waiting on some

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:11.090
demons tail payouts but that's life let

00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:13.060
you don't half a life you know what what

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:18.129
are the things that are constant in life

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:21.500
death and waiting on demons tail payouts

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:23.740
so oh that was really dumb but our rate

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.510
of fire is kind of crushing us right now

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:29.270
which is expected I mean I've done it to

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:31.860
myself for certain but you got more for

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:39.120
me not just the one

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:41.580
I didn't anticipate necessarily out

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.790
catastrophic use mascara could be but

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:49.920
we're not we're not dead I am very

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:51.810
surprised at our seeming hole okay

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.950
I actually flinched away from the

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:57.180
computer when that thing blew up in my

00:34:52.950 --> 00:35:01.680
face surprised by our seeming inability

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:05.460
to I don't want to get close to this guy

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.480
as a thing please okay you shoddy shoddy

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.310
shot go go go

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.140
are assuming inability to get a single

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.140
spirit heart out of our situation here I

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:19.470
don't know with the bad rate of fire I

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:24.420
think we've got to focus on taking out

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:25.920
the debt reduce you know making sure the

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.160
Flies don't get close enough to get in

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.160
here

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:45.050
well sadly you're fun I think the first

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:49.700
thing you do is fight the boss I wish it

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:54.800
were not you though kidney stone and him

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:58.760
and him stay dialed in

00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:02.290
Wing Commander Freddie Prinze jr. he's

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:06.470
done it no he's dead

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:07.640
dude I am I mean Isaac he'll but I'm

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.320
going to make my way through this I

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:13.010
actually don't think we played super

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:15.650
terribly spawning with two black cards

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:18.980
on a dank Tepes XL with not amazing

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:20.390
stats the chance for a loss is in there

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.800
plus we've got a little cute I was

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:24.110
killed by this thing in some dark place

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.310
icon so I like that for now thanks for
