00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.509
hey everybody welcome back syndrome lamb

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.370
please minding Wesleyan triple plus

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.620
let's get going to save files to go I

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.360
don't think so

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.109
how are you doing my cat why do you have

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.840
some weird stuff on your face cool you

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:25.490
wouldn't okay keep it runs let's go

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.230
here's the seed HR 21 okay 11 let's go

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.269
mom's knife right off the bed now I

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.850
recognize this a lot of triple-shot moms

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.829
knife happening in a pretty short amount

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.030
of time both of those shots were

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.520
ruthless

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
either way um it's a lot of triple shot

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.780
moms knife happening happening in a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.789
short amount of time but that's the way

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.910
the cookie crumbles when you're doing a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.489
keeper run we random the keeper is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.550
effectively all bets are off so half of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.620
the keeper is getting good

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.949
well let's say 1/3 of the keeper is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.549
having a good set of luck you know

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.470
getting good items another third is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.040
properly using the Wooden Nickel as

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.110
often as possible and using it on a room

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.299
instead of after a room and then the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.720
other part of the keeper is your actual

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.640
play so now that we have this and by

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.540
this I mean mom's knife what we are

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.250
looking for predominantly is a swallow

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.869
penny we should just gone to the shop

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.939
it's free but we're looking for

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.650
swallowed penny or nun's habit something

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.909
along those lines and we're looking for

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.780
a speed upgrade if we could finagle that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:47.700
I'd be a happy camper so here's how you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.360
do this good stuff should pop it there's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.360
no reason not to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.939
we're getting it back anyway yeah speed

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.020
upgrade is on the list there's no doubt

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.789
about it we're going to get enough money

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.289
to go to our shop as well we'll just

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.860
leave one penny on the ground just in

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.439
case

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.240
there we go 15 cents I don't know if

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.890
there's speed upgrades that you can buy

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.050
on the shop but let's go check and see

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.760
what they got to begin with nuns have it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.950
huge actually genuinely huge gives us

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.180
two plays before we really have to worry

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.430
and a Joker card is not that bad that's

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.950
not going to be a secret room but it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.840
also not that good the way I would in an

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.239
ideal world the way you use the Joker

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.980
card is the keeper is - well you can

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.200
teleport on a room after you get hit and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.940
maybe save yourself but ideally create

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.400
deals with the angel and then you can

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.769
get value out of them there I don't

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.090
think the Goathead or contract from

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.819
below are worth taking but there is a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.590
temptation there admittedly if we had go

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.680
dead nine lives I'd be over in a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.019
heartbeat but in our present situation

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.730
no such luck so you can't really go to

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.160
the curse room even with the Joker

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.579
teleporting because we need the extra we

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.109
need to guarantee basically and the only

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.150
thing we wanted I hear a small rock but

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.319
small rock may also constitute a speed

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.220
downgrade so we've got to be cautious

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.489
the last thing we're doing here is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.760
getting our item room see what we got

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.859
speed upgrade please that is an actual

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.209
speed downgrade you could be forgiven

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.950
for thinking that's the right call but

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.870
you would be incorrect I'm going to take

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.389
Ethan's blessing because it's a tears

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.069
upgrade which with moms knife means I

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.450
can stand further away from enemies

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:36.090
without incurring the same level of risk

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.769
that I normally would face so I'm going

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.889
to try okay we spent a bomb for nothing

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.480
could be worse has been worse and we'll

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.329
find our secret room our secret room

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.840
contains pills feels like I'm walking on

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.380
sunshine

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.970
I can see forever and the Joker card is

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.769
better let's get out of here leaving a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.310
penny behind that's basically your

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.020
relevant real how you doing buddy you're

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.050
gonna be my keeper good luck charm so

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.790
far so good here we're going to pop this

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.730
right off the bat and I'm completely

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:18.060
content to get the sensor I believe this

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.040
damages enemys that fall into its area

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.780
of effect which is actually extremely

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.590
useful because enemies that rush us down

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.440
could be a big problem so I am not at

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:34.050
all sweating this pick up we're still

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.330
you have to be very overpowered to feel

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.870
super confident on a keeper run the big

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.300
deal now with nine lives is the fact

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.680
that we could still pick up sorry the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.700
big deal right now with nun's habit is

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.860
the fact we could still pick up

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.730
something like nine lives and nine lives

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.620
even if it left us with 1 hp pretty good

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.290
apparently sensor is only slowing

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.830
effects but honestly that's still pretty

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.390
great I'm not going to kick it out here

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.030
for eating crackers you know what I mean

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.620
that was like the very slightest move to

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.630
get that but it worked out regardless

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.730
just don't accidentally walk into damage

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.160
that's important don't use your knife to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.740
blow up a barrel accidentally without

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.140
you paying attention

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.060
and apart from that just keep doing what

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.620
you're doing if you know might strike

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.570
you the moms knife triple shot is a

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.270
little bit of a boring keeper run if I

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.460
could live my whole life of keeper runs

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.910
in a boring fashion that leads to wins I

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.780
would do so no questions asked so a

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:41.130
keeper run is all about survival I think

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.860
we should take petrified poop I don't

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.180
mind using keys that like means zero

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.130
problems for me right now

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:53.040
petrified poop is more money more money

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:56.940
is potentially more HP so nasty bosses

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:02.910
might get walking on sunshine hmm that's

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.350
unthinkable in my opinion we should

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.090
probably use walking on sunshine it's

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.880
like a get-out-of-jail-free card okay so

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.880
you do take this thing experimental

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.770
treatment health down speed down is

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.740
horrible here but every everything else

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.700
went up which was fine and then we also

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.010
got

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.090
our health back but yeah this this

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:27.140
creates a problem 0.65 speed so

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.790
occasionally goes up to 0.95 thanks to

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.260
skinny odd mushroom or you know maybe

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:38.220
many much but one of the liberty cap

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:41.100
payouts but still obviously this is a

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.630
slightly you know wonky situation that

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.960
we got to deal with here but we got some

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.520
time to get out of here and I think I

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.290
would do that again it does suck that

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.620
experimental treatment paid out with a

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.300
speed downgrade there's no way that we

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.460
could have known it but we could have

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.690
inferred that that was a chance and to

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.090
be honest with you the thought didn't

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:06.060
even really cross my mind so now it's up

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.720
to us to get out of it it's also up to

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.330
us to actually use wooden nickels

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.700
appropriately we don't have a choice

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:18.990
so we'll take Remo baby which is fine

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.120
but not anything too exciting and you

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.570
know what we'll take spider-man as well

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.760
I don't see a compelling reason not to

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.330
accept that it is going to spend money

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:33.060
but hopefully we're going to be rich in

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.440
money regardless eventually or we're

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:41.760
going to continue to have enough at the

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:44.010
very least Lux debt is at zero I'm not

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.990
sure if you need luck to get better

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.820
payouts I think it's 5050 always on

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.160
wooden nickels so it's going to keep

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.020
rolling as is right now and feeling

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.250
relatively content we're going to be so

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:59.300
far ahead of schedule by the way getting

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.300
good luck on these payouts

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.330
like we're probably going to be out of

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.740
this floor before 10 minutes which is

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.660
three minutes ahead of schedule now

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.730
really that's what happens when you have

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:17.790
mom's knife as your first item room

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:20.990
that's a pretty great get and I mean we

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:23.640
can get a lot of bombs out of it but

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:26.250
does that actually matter for us right

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.750
now it could but I like that

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.060
occasionally we get speed upgrades

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:37.620
admittedly we do occasionally get speed

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:38.970
down grades as well but you know you got

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.770
to take the good with the bad I suppose

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.560
and we're out of this floor sadly

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:48.150
without having gotten anything for our

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.830
speed downs but we do have mom's legs

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.200
and thankfully the ability to slow

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.600
enemies that get too close to us so

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.630
hopefully we have the wave of power to

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.760
stop this we got ways to get ourselves

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.170
extra HP we also have a feels like I'm

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.660
walking on sunshine we can use that to

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:08.880
get out of a particular Jam but it is

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:12.570
dicey ish 100% deal with the devil

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.220
chance though at least for now see how

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:19.700
you kind of got stuck between a rock and

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.700
a hard place there much better

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.090
library yeah is going to say it seemed a

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.460
little too close to the spawn so you

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:31.940
start by grabbing the Bible here this is

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:37.580
good we're gonna get bookworm which

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:39.650
shouldn't lower our rate of fire speed

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:43.480
uphill maybe see if we can get an

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:49.460
orbital thanks to using that got a try

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:51.440
infested we still in my opinion have to

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.730
roll Wooden Nickel but that was a really

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.700
good use of two keys

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:58.180
I don't mind occasionally we should

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.820
shoot out five knives instead of three

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:04.520
we should also more than occasionally

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.260
consider you know using the Wooden

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:11.720
Nickel I'm kind of harping on it here

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:15.320
but for good reason there you go get

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.120
back in the saddle and remember reason

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.100
to use Wooden Nickel is not too slowly

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.470
accrue money that's just a nice side

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.650
benefit reason you use it as to leave

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.510
you with HP on a room that you might

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.460
take damage on we have petrified poop we

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:36.080
should be shooting poop on the regular

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:39.320
as well dude the sensor might actually

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.700
be a top-tier item for us right now it

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.980
was it was you show me a secret room

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:48.530
Beckham you might have been showing me a

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:53.720
secret room you were showing me a secret

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:55.910
room for flies dude I'm not against it

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.850
that's actually okay and I did see a

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:03.410
little bit of mapping there we should

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:08.450
fight war here that's going to be enough

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:11.720
for our shop it wasn't already yeah we

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:14.720
should fight war here thank you for the

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.060
keys this might be a preventive

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.290
opportunity for us to use feels like I'm

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.760
walking on sunshine but we're not going

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.770
to need to okay so we got a deal with

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.220
the devil we don't want any of that

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.820
that's unfortunate I don't want a deal

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.620
with the devil

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.030
unless it's nine lives I want to deal

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.379
with the angel because we can afford to

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.989
actually take it

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:42.129
these guys are hell on a low speed run

00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:43.839
so lucky us um it's probably the wrong

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:45.129
way to go but we're so far ahead of

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:47.439
schedule that it doesn't matter maybe it

00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:54.939
is the right way to go it loops back

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:57.220
around in a super weird way so in spite

00:11:54.939 --> 00:12:00.549
of 0.65 speed we haven't taken damage in

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:03.699
a long long time this is obviously not

00:12:00.549 --> 00:12:12.489
super good for us but again life

00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:14.439
continues to go on this is good and we

00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:17.559
got to see get here to a heart's not

00:12:14.439 --> 00:12:24.279
worth anything pay to play might

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:25.869
occasionally give us a tour sorry well

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:27.970
in this case it is HP but give us money

00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:33.399
after we get hit is that is there any

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:37.779
semblance of truth to that jarrah flies

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:40.839
is not good enough I didn't mean to buy

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:41.889
two of hearts necessarily but trying to

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:43.659
find something here that's worth

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:45.249
grabbing you know oh dude thank you

00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:47.949
that's so huge I don't mind using our

00:12:45.249 --> 00:12:49.329
bombs here this is fine the present

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:50.709
blank card feels like I'm walking on

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:53.799
sunshine I think you just take present

00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:58.959
and just use it okay if it's actually

00:12:53.799 --> 00:13:00.579
terrible let's get out of here dude so

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:02.019
we're about to have the opportunity to

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:04.239
go to boss Russia to the keeper

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:09.489
something I have not wanted to do

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:12.609
consciously in a long time however if

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:14.199
the situation is right I'm going to run

00:13:12.609 --> 00:13:16.989
all night I'm going to run to you that's

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:19.089
what Bryan Adams said and honestly that

00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:20.889
Canadian pop prince has a good head on

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:24.009
his shoulders I'm going to consider it

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:25.149
but it'll have to be you know the game

00:13:24.009 --> 00:13:27.970
is going to have to meet me more than

00:13:25.149 --> 00:13:28.449
halfway ie where the heck is my speed

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.749
upgrade

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:32.889
I ordered it 25 minutes ago some of us

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:36.999
have places to be today

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:40.539
and my place I intend to be is not in

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:42.400
oncoming traffic with you know enemies

00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:44.440
bearing down on me that I can't

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.350
managed to get the heck around so the

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:51.270
black rune is lovely but not an

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:56.250
appropriate choice for our deal with the

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.250
not an appropriate choice for boss rush

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.480
necessarily so of course I did damage to

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.839
myself it's the only thing that makes

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.980
sense in this crazy mixed-up world not

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:07.660
an appropriate choice for boss rush

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:14.620
because it forces us to fight the

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:16.330
enemies after we suck up the items would

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.730
have been a really really good

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.560
opportunity for nine lives so be it you

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.029
know what maybe that's the damage that

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.690
we took right there that's going to

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:28.150
bring us around that's going to be the

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.850
galvanizing like loss that your team

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:33.279
takes in week 14 and then you go I don't

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.410
know you know this could sunder them but

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:38.110
instead it brings them together and they

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.180
win the flippin Super Bowl as a result

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:47.820
you know that's what we're gunning for

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:47.820
right now bad use of the Wooden Nickel

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.870
but we're not going to get hit on this

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.870
room

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.500
no consumable drops how do we get to

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.570
three luck oh because we found the

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.810
really really perfect shop this is

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:10.110
awesome proptosis base if not basically

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:11.790
literally doubled our damage so not

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.520
saying that that means we are going to

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:17.070
fights boss rush because I think that

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.330
that honestly doesn't damage was not our

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:22.520
issue we were still killing enemies

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.520
really fast killing them faster is good

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:28.880
where applicable but it's not the end

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:36.780
but we still need speed you know what

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.390
nine-volt doesn't actually do anything

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.940
for us but for seven cents just seems

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:45.450
like the right call but i feel like it

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:48.020
actually does nothing because it doesn't

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.130
give us a charge on the room does it

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.900
like while we're doing it it doesn't

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.740
slowly recharge oh it does slowly

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.130
recharge it's just very very slow dude

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.540
come on

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:06.060
you know you want to give me that nine

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:11.840
lives well it's a big moment for us take

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:15.690
polaroid see we get mined holy mantle

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.450
tears up bombs I mean the mind is good

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:21.750
we could probably make this work

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:23.640
and it would be hilarious but I think

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.560
you know let's not look a gift horse in

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.840
the mouth here they've given us a great

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.970
run we should just try to make the most

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.590
of it at this point so we know that our

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.170
bosses are going to be north it doesn't

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:39.720
tell us that much because sometimes you

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:41.150
got to go south to get north it's not

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.700
going to be this way

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:46.140
and this is where it all comes down I

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.300
got to be honest with you this is

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.560
probably it feels to me right now like

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:53.160
this is the easiest keeper run I've ever

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:58.530
had and proptosis mom's knife will

00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:00.089
probably do that for you but it's up to

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:03.240
us to not squander it because it would

00:17:00.089 --> 00:17:06.720
just be that much more bitter if it all

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.070
came crashing down you know shouldn't

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.990
have picked that up

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.730
just nice knowing there's a coin there

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:17.130
for peace of mind helps you avoid

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:24.230
getting tilted I think we do have a

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:26.130
secret room I guess it just flies away

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.890
I'm only doing this because I want to

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.750
hit the other button but God dang and

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.300
okay please let me out of here you know

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.980
you're extremely rude if it's only

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:39.150
adjacent on these two sides then we're

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:43.260
just going to go now we skip the boss

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:49.140
rush because we're babies we will have a

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:50.820
chance to do hush again if you could

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:55.200
find it in your heart to give me nine

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:58.650
lives I would honestly consider giving

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.560
it the old college try it's a penny in

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:03.530
here somewhere but I don't really care

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:09.780
but without nine lives it just is non

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:11.940
justifiable which is a great name for a

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.980
Justin Timberlake solo album but not a

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.380
great situation to be in necessarily

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.240
yards we have a penny yes important

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.590
because our range is not superb but then

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:25.040
we just killed them all in one hit

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:27.960
anyway just hold it together this runs

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.490
good play good play this runs all about

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.830
focus right now is what I was just going

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.360
to say thank God we picked up literally

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.700
every single coin I've ever generated

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.680
because now we have to walk all the way

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:41.480
back here but we got out of it that's

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.290
what matters there is a coin back here

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.800
irrelevant but okay

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:49.440
so we've lost our get-out-of-jail-free

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:55.080
card in the form of feels like I'm

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:59.150
walking on sunshine that is a little bit

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.150
of a safety net that disappeared for us

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.179
I got the utmost faith that we can

00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:07.240
survive in spite of that it's really

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:09.230
just a setback you know what you call a

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.600
get-out-of-jail-free card you didn't use

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.490
wasted space in your inventory dude so

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.030
honestly we should be thankful for the

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.410
opportunity to actually get oh come on

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:20.960
actually get some value out of it

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.900
I said oh come on not because the runs

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.730
being unfair but like with 0.65 speed on

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.789
the womb - you're going to make me go

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:30.320
all the way around here in order to get

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:35.770
to the boss fight I know where the boss

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.770
fight is you're just being ridiculous

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:50.809
well if it takes another six rooms and

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:52.460
takes another six rooms regular chest

00:19:50.809 --> 00:19:53.600
again I mean it could be valuable but

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.990
we're kind of getting to the point where

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.429
I will always have an excuse for why I

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.740
don't pick up a consumable that's one of

00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:04.309
the things apparently you need to either

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:06.789
know about me but in this case I think

00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:09.950
we've got a better excuse than usual

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:12.200
0.65 speed is like straight up are you

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:17.000
kidding me levels oh he's done it

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:19.460
caffeine pill 0.95 speed occasionally

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.760
0.85 depending on what mushroom again

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:24.200
actually feels like a blessing the

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.559
mushrooms are coming from Liberty Cap by

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:32.419
the way in case you're confused angel

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:34.039
room seraphim not bad without getting a

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:35.330
payout I'm not going to fight the angel

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:38.380
statue let's just move on

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:40.730
Seraphim is just fine it's not

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:51.289
remarkably transformative it's just

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:53.799
pretty great but their waffles the speed

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:56.799
upgrade in the form of caffeine pill is

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:56.799
all-important

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:03.979
and honestly apart from the womb where

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:05.989
we just had that slightly awkward

00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:08.739
situation come up we haven't really been

00:21:05.989 --> 00:21:12.349
close to death on many occasions here I

00:21:08.739 --> 00:21:14.049
will say that in spite of the situation

00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:16.219
that we found ourselves with right now

00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:20.479
with caffeine pill coming through in the

00:21:16.219 --> 00:21:22.459
clutch still use a speed upgrade 0.95

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:24.830
speed was 0.85 speed occasionally and

00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:26.239
1.25 speed occasionally but I'm less

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.589
concern about rooms in which I have good

00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:33.169
speed and much more concerned about the

00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:34.789
rooms in which I have terrible speed we

00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:36.469
could still use a little bit now that's

00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:39.379
what the chest is for you know filling

00:21:36.469 --> 00:21:43.099
in the gaps hopefully but you know

00:21:39.379 --> 00:21:46.659
earlier on this run I said you know

00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:53.779
there's three parts to a good keeper run

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:56.749
how you use the let me just deal with

00:21:53.779 --> 00:22:00.559
this room how you use the Wooden Nickel

00:21:56.749 --> 00:22:01.909
as part of it how you play as part of it

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:06.249
and then the quality of the run is part

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:06.249
of it this is like 80% quality of run

00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:14.619
there's a certain element of luck you

00:22:11.209 --> 00:22:18.440
really want to get Wooden Nickel payouts

00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:20.119
on bossfights because you know

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.339
occasionally you can have a brain fart

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:26.209
like that leaves you in a compromised

00:22:22.339 --> 00:22:27.979
position made it back thankfully and we

00:22:26.209 --> 00:22:31.509
can still lose this one on like a double

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:34.070
gate room I think it's plausible or a

00:22:31.509 --> 00:22:36.440
double adversary you can even get like

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:40.940
triple adversaries so we actually just

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:42.619
cannot take the shears for one but we

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.049
can't take Taurus Taurus it's just too

00:22:42.619 --> 00:22:47.450
risky if we get a bunch of free speed

00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:49.940
upgrades then I'm actually going to be

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:52.129
thrilled that we have it but without

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.329
those no such luck so that's nun's habit

00:22:52.129 --> 00:22:56.320
coming through in the clutch for us

00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:56.320
there thank you very much

00:22:58.309 --> 00:23:04.200
leave some coins behind because this is

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.340
like we're in this we're 20 minutes on

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.220
the chest

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:12.679
that's an amazing position to be in on a

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:14.900
keeper run don't botch it leach is great

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:19.350
no we don't care about the lifesteal

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:20.490
basically at all flies would be nice I

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.250
suppose because I already killed our

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.490
chance of the virus but what we do care

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.720
about is not getting hit and at least

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.350
can kill enemies before they can get to

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:35.050
us even better that's important okay so

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:38.220
we do have a nine lives potential here

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.220
[Music]

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:46.789
two coins that's no problem

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:50.400
get this guy first he's got to go and

00:23:46.789 --> 00:24:01.760
then you got we did get nine lives do

00:23:50.400 --> 00:24:01.760
you take it well this room so risky I

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:13.770
mean we should what I want to see like

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.169
the reason I haven't taken it yet is

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:19.049
because if we can just get an HP upgrade

00:24:16.169 --> 00:24:23.669
from another room then nine lives

00:24:19.049 --> 00:24:25.679
becomes a no-brainer but there is a case

00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:28.289
to be made that maybe this late in the

00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:31.080
game to HP is better than nine lives

00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:32.789
it's not just me trying to be contrarian

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:39.960
to be honestly this is an HP chance

00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:43.919
right here nine lives might be worse

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:48.890
than one life with two HP I don't know

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:56.240
it it does spread out the risk and

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:56.240
that's worth something look at that shot

00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:07.489
I think we're probably going to win

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:08.809
either way but admittedly it's kind of

00:25:07.489 --> 00:25:10.700
tough moon card is a

00:25:08.809 --> 00:25:13.879
get-out-of-jail-free assuming we don't

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.499
teleport into a into a greed fight that

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:21.349
immediately shoots us which could happen

00:25:15.499 --> 00:25:24.049
but hopefully wouldn't if we win this

00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:26.679
run is being dedicated to the sensor

00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:26.679
honestly

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:38.100
the fact that every tear that gets close

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:41.280
to us gets slowed down has never been

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.980
more useful for me than right now on a

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.430
run where you know if anything touches

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:58.730
us my blood pressure spikes by like 40

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:58.730
points systolic or diastolic tells me

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:05.900
fuck yeah we'll follow your guidelines

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:08.790
those who too high

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.050
that's a Rage Against the Machine I

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.480
think were going to try it with two HP

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:17.220
if we get to pay out immediately

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.850
we actually just win if we don't get it

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.950
immediately

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:24.840
we probably win see that's not great

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:27.420
that's I mean I don't even know at this

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:29.570
point why mess with it but also that's

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.160
hilarious

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:34.050
we didn't get the payoff if you get a

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.350
hit just teleport if you get hit early

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.350
at least

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:47.440
the strange keeper run dude we're going

00:26:44.919 --> 00:26:52.690
to win dude that was a killer run

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:55.509
nothing I can't do it I can't I know

00:26:52.690 --> 00:27:00.009
it's no balls but I can't do it because

00:26:55.509 --> 00:27:04.990
there's no way there's no successful way

00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:07.630
out of a keeper delirium run I can't do

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.279
it it's burning me up inside I promise

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.929
you even nine lives is not enough

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:13.509
the keeper just tell it frags you too

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:16.299
much also my blood pressure spiked five

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:17.950
hundred points I know I squandered the

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:19.120
goodwill at the end but for now thanks

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.169
