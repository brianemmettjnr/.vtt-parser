00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.840
everybody welcome act under the line

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.120
please inviting guys Gareth plus of

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
course I asked what you want to see a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.500
new save file Isaac you want to see

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.440
random runs we go off on like a top 20%

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.400
streak by my standards at least MLR one

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.820
p7b zero transcendence and the beam my

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.070
favorites of midseason replacement on

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.840
CBS

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.600
transcendence transcendence and the B

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.210
none of all the singers to try to parry

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.070
Elton John really I don't have that kind

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.170
of range really bad rate of fire damages

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.430
okay actually I was going to say bad

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.300
because it's under four but that would

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.070
be incorrect

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
three point eight eight is totally fine

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.600
speed is good and of course the fact

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.789
that we can fly makes up for the fact

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.570
that I mean actually the real problem

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.250
with this run is lazy worm as strange as

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.660
that might sound lazy worm is actually

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.270
just trash for us right now I'm going to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.309
drop it then our shot speed like yeah

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.420
now it's appropriate our range goes down

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.380
as a result but I think that's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.180
completely fine

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.310
the ability to fly in the fact that we

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
have this space bar item that we can use

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.900
once per room as not amazing as it is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.270
it's still like good enough to give us a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.890
leg up on on the average run so we got

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.810
below average HP show we're not

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.770
necessarily crushing it on DPS but we're

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.650
not doing too badly but a really really

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.570
really good utility item combined with

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.520
the space bar item that'll not although

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.979
not incredible all not there you go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.110
that's a new word the way better than

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.930
the Allnut which is the B Allspark in

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.570
the pornographic version of the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.220
Transformers films there's here there's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.710
your punch allenge or wordplay challenge

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.009
of the day what would an x-rated

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.009
Transformers film be called trans

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.369
blowers I don't think so I think you run

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.240
the risk getting into some dangerous

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.240
territory here

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.860
train blowers she sucks off this guy

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.940
seed like it's I'm not sure I'm going to

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.930
go ahead and say that this one's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.700
probably not going to make it in

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.129
Hollywood or wherever the hotbed of the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.790
first off hotbed great term for the

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.160
center of art where pornography comes

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.900
from but secondly probably not going to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.780
get greenlit in that industry is my

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.010
guess maybe a blacklist if you want to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
see the kinds of fluids that have been

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.780
left on the bed honestly I think I'm

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.340
gonna stay away from the large pickup

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.060
and a one negative speed right now even

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.470
I really have come to value speed you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.239
can go back you know a year and a half

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.390
and see episodes where I go oh good a

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.590
speed upgrade how useless but to be

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.000
honest with you I didn't know what I was

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.590
talking about that was a young man's

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200
interpretation of what makes a strong

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.970
run sure damage does make a strong run

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.269
rate of fire makes a strong run speed

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.359
makes a strong run survivable whereas

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.310
HP's honestly it means so much less most

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.450
of the time then then you would

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.630
initially think so

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.220
although lard I mean don't get me wrong

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.840
there's been situations where we have

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.819
essentially won because we've gotten an

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.769
HP upgrade at the right time and those

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:30.650
situations happen multiple times per

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:32.329
month for sure but I think we'd stand to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.590
lose more than we stand to gain anyway

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.900
this one's popping off we got a really

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.220
nice tiers upgrade and then combined

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.599
with that we have X plus Evo which is

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.599
fairly good most of the time

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.120
HP right off the bat kind of stinks

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.370
we'll take both of these though dark

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.230
matters lovely ghost baby is irrelevant

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.610
and we find ourselves really light on HP

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.000
but otherwise feeling great lots of

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.860
consumables dark matter was a pretty

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.269
sizable tears upgrade which is important

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.349
or sorry pretty sizable damage upgrade

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.549
which is important especially when I

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.540
rated fire continues to pop off and

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.610
we're still we're still looking good

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.890
here little little dicey on the HP front

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.150
but that's fine if I've gotten to speed

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.640
upgrade on this floor I might have felt

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.680
a little sore about the fact that I

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.989
didn't go with lard on the last floor

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.459
but usually HP upgrades I want to say

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.100
they're a dime a dozen we're picking

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.870
them up by accident that should tell you

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.039
about how precious they tend to be on

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.520
average but we've run into the situation

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.310
a lot recently over aggression on deals

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.990
of the devil can get you killed we

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.430
definitely did not need to pick up ghost

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.530
baby but when your first choice gives

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.630
you a dark matter I think it gives you a

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.400
little it gives you like deal with the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.740
devil armor you feel like nothing can

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.150
stop you it's not necessarily true I

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.139
never really felt that way as a teenager

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.520
you know that to some extent I guess but

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.440
you know people always go out when I was

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.419
like a young man I felt like I was

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.099
invincible never really felt like that

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.530
remote detonators at least five bombs

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.580
it's a good bad item which is if you're

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.380
going to get an item you're not going to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.120
want and he could use you five bombs

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.680
hopefully we get a tinted rock out of it

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.180
at some point but you know drive my car

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.370
300 kilometers an hour in the wrong lane

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.380
I was never really that kind of kid but

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.300
definitely like now there have been

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.880
situations where I've gotten out of bed

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.560
and like I'm not gonna say it threw my

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.320
back out but like pull the muscle in my

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.139
back like oh what a beautiful morning oh

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.580
what a beautiful and then for the rest

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.900
of the day I'm like just kind of

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.599
squirming in my seat like it doesn't

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.300
quite feel right you know so I rest

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.919
assured Issac is about the closest I

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.199
come to feeling invincible on a regular

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.669
basis and this run is not quite at that

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:52.950
level of invincibility but I've come to

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.469
realize that because of the way I play

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.420
the game I am probably the greatest

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:03.430
danger to my own self here

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:05.770
and that sounds very egotistical it's

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.450
not that the games not difficult but

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.760
it's more that we're living in a post

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.910
difficult Isak world the average run is

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.920
not difficult because we've done 35,000

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:20.350
runs over the course of our life instead

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.030
the real danger comes from thinking that

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.190
you're going to be fine on a run and

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.750
thus betting a little too aggressively

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.000
in the early game and then if it trails

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.350
off in the late game you haven't got the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.820
the safety net that you would otherwise

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.640
have if you played a little bit more

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.260
conservatively so I don't intend to

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.210
change my play style because this is fun

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.590
but I don't know I think that's why we

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.350
go through fits and spurts you know when

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.240
we get a lot of good starts in a row

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.320
start to build up some confidence and

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.850
some momentum and then when that

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.310
confidence gets eroded that's where we

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.550
end up you know losing three runs over

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.690
the course of four videos or something

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.600
like that having a relatively

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.550
unimpressive time of things but for

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.590
right now how could I not be loved in

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.290
life you know we've got some like

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.180
sixteen sixteen wins in a row and I'm

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.720
feeling like a man on to the next

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.280
sixteen which is probably not something

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.310
we should get too attached to but I

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:19.660
remember what it was like to have that

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.310
like 110 Street going it wasn't at the

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.260
time this is very Tooting my own horn

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:27.550
admittedly but it wasn't like I was

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.290
worried Polyphemus it wasn't like I was

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.570
worried about the next drug I was like

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.980
we got the next five no problem even

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.760
without knowing what the seeds are going

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:40.120
to be I just feel it in my bones it took

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.430
like a a one in a hundred quality

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.310
garbage seed in order to kill us on that

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.810
one and I feel that I feel similar right

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.990
now not quite the same you know I

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:52.960
haven't built up the the same degree of

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.400
confidence because you know we're 1/10

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.860
of the way they were out like 1/8 of the

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.160
way there but we're getting there dude

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:05.110
and I'm feeling good I'm feeling the the

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.569
potential deep inside of me at phrasing

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.750
we didn't have like a Council of Nicaea

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:12.879
as English language speakers on double

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.500
entendre because I think we're a little

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:16.090
too fast and loose but I don't know if

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:22.419
this applies for other languages and may

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:23.919
well well somehow that sort of works you

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:26.440
know there's so many words you can't say

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:29.050
now because they have a mild you know

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.669
erotic connotation in it I don't support

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.959
that I want to be able to say thick

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:36.579
without it being like you know da II

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:39.329
know what I'm saying I want to be able

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:41.260
to say moist moist is an important word

00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:46.660
it's a great word to describe a

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:48.790
chocolate cake for example and honestly

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.040
if you can't handle that word first off

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:55.120
I can't help but feel you're going to

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.709
have a hard time in modern society if

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.329
you're already an adult and you're

00:08:56.709 --> 00:09:01.079
dealing with a distaste of the word

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:03.790
moist I understand but I'm a man you

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:06.839
you're going to face greater hardships

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.649
than that on a regular basis you know

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:10.270
every day you're going to be

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:11.980
encountering situations where you're

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.790
like you're going to tell me you're

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.230
going to be like I wish that this person

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.570
that is you know cutting me off in

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.000
traffic was nicer but at least I'm not

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.610
saying moist I don't know if I buy it

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.230
either way dude no spirit hearts in

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.730
there is actually dire that was a such a

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:32.680
botch of metaphor I just want to move on

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:35.110
please allow this okay we were too fast

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:39.149
and loose with the with a double

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:43.360
entendre I don't respect it

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:46.500
neither rework some words calm is the

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.699
big one you know you can't oh you can't

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.810
get a call from your friend and they'll

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:51.190
be like hey where are you you be like

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:56.190
don't worry I'm coming and without

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:56.190
getting a kill kill kill kill you know

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.850
we can do better not just as as speakers

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:08.290
but as comedians these are lazy bits of

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:10.690
humor and I believe that we got more

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:14.560
comedic potential inside of us

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:16.720
I got a comedian up inside of me can get

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.380
a special on HBO but I got a sitcom on

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.380
NBC

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:27.700
careful dude we cannot buy a spirit

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.530
heart I mean literally we cannot buy a

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.420
spirit art but also figuratively with

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.340
all the resources that we have we can't

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.670
manifest a spirit art into existence and

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.620
it's driving me absurdly crazy here

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.690
this we should be completely set but the

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.150
games leaving us in a an awkward sort of

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.200
limbo I still I mean I believe that

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.930
would have found it but I got to check

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.640
in just in case all right well we're

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.010
down to the next floor with 21 damage

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:57.970
that's great one and a half HP that

00:10:51.010 --> 00:11:02.290
point is good not quite as good but not

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:04.420
a certainly not a run that I would be

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.150
favored to lose at this point but it can

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:10.480
go wrong quickly this is not a train

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:14.040
wreck what it was this is like a Space

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:19.540
Shuttle crash you know a train wreck

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:22.780
library yeah library with no books that

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.290
provide us with healing but okay sure no

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.510
problem

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.340
I guess we'll probably go Book of

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.380
Shadows even though we used it for no

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.270
reason on that room the invincibility

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.800
will be nice and if we get something

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.000
that allows us to like the virus for

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.190
example we touch an enemy they could

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.890
generate hearts for us that's important

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:42.040
bookworm also potentially pretty nice

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.780
but especially with our damage as it is

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.170
right now Nine Lives would be wonderful

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.490
here like a train wreck

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.110
admittedly I know nothing about it but

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.970
it's the kind of thing people say all

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.830
you know you it's gross but you can't

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.020
look away you can sort of you see a

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.160
common it's more like a shipwreck

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.440
honestly right like from what I

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.380
understand about like a cruise ship

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.200
crash that actually takes like an hour

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.339
to happen it's never like power and now

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.260
we're at the bottom of the ocean you

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:10.180
know it's like a hole has been blown to

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.950
the ship and now we're tilting to the

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.950
side at the rate of like three degrees

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:17.860
per minute so in a half hour we're going

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:20.110
to be totally tipped over here this run

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:24.220
is the potential to be more like you

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:26.800
know the freaking oring we bought from

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.930
the cheapest bidder exploded upon like

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.400
rapid depressurization or something like

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.740
that and

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.620
it's a tragic accident not to make light

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:38.850
of of course something that was you know

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:42.240
in a dire moment in American scientific

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:45.300
history I'm just saying the metaphor the

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.700
metaphor is innocent death card it's

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:51.480
okay the death card is ahead of just

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.890
just desire a spirit heart here it

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.480
doesn't have to be a spirit heart it

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.890
could be nine lives if we get nine lives

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.180
we win we get dark Judas we probably win

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.320
we're almost I wouldn't say almost

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.490
guaranteed we've got a good chance of

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.550
getting a deal with the devil on this

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:08.460
floor so that could happen we get HP we

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.740
probably win we can definitely afford to

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.290
be as a Grove as we want to our donation

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:16.020
machine which we have built from 0 to

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:18.960
999 over the course of like a year and

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.820
now have finally gotten back sackboy is

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.770
usually like a game-winning item in and

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.420
of itself so I'm not not feeling too bad

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.270
right now even just getting our death

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.130
card back it doesn't seem that good but

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.080
it is because it gives us the ability to

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.550
go one more room without using Book of

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.260
Shadows and who knows how that actually

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:41.280
ends up you know working out for us long

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:43.830
term this is important you know Thomas

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.870
this is irrelevant lockup is nice but

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.950
largely irrelevant puberty good in the

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:52.230
future and addicted just genuinely bad I

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:54.390
don't know if I've seen this is actually

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.740
remarkably similar to that Judas run we

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.970
lost on I think it might have been our

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.740
last loss just no HP for several floors

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.560
despite the run being well actually that

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:08.190
run was garbage way so we got one and a

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:11.420
half HP as long as you don't press Q we

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.420
shouldn't be able to lose here

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:23.620
lump of coal is fine dude

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:25.899
this is like it's the best worst one we

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.850
should examine more for tinted rocks

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:31.120
without a doubt but there's there's a

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.200
mild but very real chance that we could

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.760
be leaving this floor with one and a

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.959
half HP and that's if we don't get hit I

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:47.080
don't know if I'm willing to bet the

00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:49.600
farm on that okay well is absurd I have

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:53.950
faith certainly we got a chance at boss

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.480
rush here the dream is that we're able

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.040
to pick up a spirit heart at some point

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.700
dude the luck is really nice don't get

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.320
me wrong but kind of need a little bit

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.589
more than one and a half spirit outs at

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.360
this point thank God we didn't throw a

00:15:05.589 --> 00:15:09.910
little bit more HP away in the early

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.940
game we couldn't have known it but I

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.950
mean well actually NL with the causality

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.570
as it is technically that would have

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.040
changed the entire universe that we find

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.520
ourselves okay well you know what you

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.500
got me

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:26.110
but it doesn't mean much for me in this

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.850
situation unless we can Ashton Kutcher

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.810
ourselves into a little spirit heart

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:34.680
placement smallest of all the loot

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.680
chests I've ever seen

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:47.930
super like genuinely thrilled that we

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:49.480
have managed to get a big fan here which

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:53.650
is going to block shots for us

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.650
surprisingly important apparently and

00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:00.320
Book Of Shadows is like actually a 10

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:05.210
and a 10 item if you don't have the HP

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:07.940
necessary to you know weather the storm

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:11.630
so to speak so very happy with that as

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:16.880
well please no new enemies are being

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:19.070
created I'm worried we're going to blow

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.870
ourselves up with X Box Evo though dude

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.890
the luck is out of control

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:28.340
I'm so grateful at the same time would

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.990
it kill you just give me the opportunity

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.080
to buy a single spirit heart I don't

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:35.930
know what voice I put on here this is

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:38.900
like hey it's my first time out of the

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:42.190
state can you tell me what kind of

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.190
sandwiches are good here in Rhode Island

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.350
dude now that we're on one HP I'm

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.760
actually genuinely now I'm saying

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:54.200
genuinely a lot it's because I'm

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.660
freaking scared B I'm so scared I just

00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:01.190
used B as a as a term of endearment I

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:04.510
don't even understand what that means so

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:10.100
we got to watch our but for champions

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:12.530
like this joker right here i was

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:15.100
actually in my head you might be

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.210
surprised to hear this I constructed a

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.800
conversational bit I was like man I'll

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.090
be really ironic until Hart showed up

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.520
here considering the situation but I

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:26.900
didn't have time to say it before two of

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:30.380
hearts showed up there made light of a

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:33.740
dangerous situation just give me the

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.250
shot please the fool is actually

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.250
important

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.860
24 bobs like that two of clubs we took

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.420
earlier is actually proving to

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.550
potentially be very important you've

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.970
been using these bombs to try to just

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:58.460
manifest a demon heart into existence

00:17:49.970 --> 00:18:03.370
basically your boy always says he wants

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:03.370
these glass cannon runs and here we are

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:09.349
especially Oh

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.349
[Music]

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:16.460
especially funny because I just said

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.320
like oh I'm not yeah I'm feeling so

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.880
confident I'm not worried about this run

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.400
I'm worried about the run five runs from

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:26.630
now you know the perfect time for hubris

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.580
to come back and bite me in the butt the

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.630
Joker card is kind of a weird call you

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.090
know what I don't feel comfortable it's

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.190
Popat Joker cards kind of a weird call

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.630
because it is sensible for us to pop it

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.800
we know we can't fight Krampus and our

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.870
odds of getting a deal with the devil

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.570
are pretty bad however it does give us a

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.840
good chance of tractor beams fine it

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:47.330
does give us a chance to get out of the

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.340
boss rush which is important especially

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.830
if there's HP upgrades in there and of

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.600
course do the lard upgrade not taking

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:57.380
that has come back to bite me I can't

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.780
believe it who would have thought well I

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.410
also I was going to construct a bit as

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.120
well about like wouldn't it be funny if

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:08.240
we end up fighting greed in our shop and

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.750
then of course there is we were able to

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.070
kill him pretty easily so I can't

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.020
complain too much it's our second item

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.660
room and it's spider butt which is

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.710
lovely but kind of lacking in the area

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:25.070
in which we require I don't actually

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:27.050
know if I've ever seen you know I don't

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:30.380
feel comfortable in this room I know if

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:34.030
I've ever seen a run go this long

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.030
without readily available HP

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:47.690
it is for real a new era they've removed

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:49.159
tinted rocks from the games skulls no

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.669
longer have any chance to pay out

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:57.710
apparently feel like I'm losing my mind

00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:59.750
here lost like one speed Oh disregard

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.940
okay to spirit arts well at the pace

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.169
that we've been going to spirit arts

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.289
should be enough to win the whole game

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:09.919
so I mean thank you game for being so

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:11.929
generous I really appreciate it just

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:13.309
give me an HP upgrade I'm not give me

00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:14.059
brimstone give me mom's knife I'm not

00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:17.289
sweating it

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:21.770
you have actually constructed a monster

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:24.200
like I have no interest in nerfing

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.909
myself at all on this run because we've

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.090
been on the verge of death for a hundred

00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:32.840
years you know what maybe this is a good

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:34.970
formative moment for me to renew good

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.789
habits and Isaac we had to play

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.500
intelligently to survive and we've been

00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:41.059
kind of throwing HP away a little bit I

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.520
guess we should roll full card instead

00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:48.159
but we've been throwing HP oh-- away a

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:50.779
little bit on recent runs so to have a

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:52.279
run that forces us to be smarter about

00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:55.490
it might be a good thing for Cano

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:57.200
algae's I mean we need to keep the full

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.210
card we should use Baccano but I'm

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.130
hoping to make it to boss rush it's not

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:04.850
going to happen I would almost guarantee

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:07.510
it at this point we got to kill this

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.510
boss too quickly

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:23.790
it still could happen which is why I'm

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:27.660
being 100% silent right now it cannot

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.730
happen anymore which means what do we

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.050
care we should just take the Joker card

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.330
with us the fool card doesn't really

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:35.340
matter because we're not going to use it

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.450
to teleport out of boss rush anyway so

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:41.180
we don't need to have duplicated

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:44.940
teleporters we should have made it

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:47.550
considering the fact that we're on a we

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:54.210
have twenty-one to image thanks like

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:55.410
really really good but you know best

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.510
laid plans of mice and men

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.130
something-something want to make God

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.320
laugh tell them the best laid plans of

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:06.770
mice and men George and Lennie great

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.770
book John Grisham real page-turner

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.140
naturally no the line is written by John

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:17.700
Steinbeck I'm quite literary you know my

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:22.620
teacher forced me to read that in the

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:30.950
ninth of grades you see Lenny represents

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:35.070
the violence of innocence okay grab this

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:39.720
no I don't want your junk a junk is an

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:43.850
iron that can't get no love from me we

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.850
have a 66% devil chance on this floor

00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:50.250
all right so we like basically very

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:52.980
marginally improved our health I did

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:56.130
throw some away but that's you're

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.720
allowed to not throw it away but like

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.340
you're allowed to get hit in Isaac we're

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:05.130
not quite at that point in the meta yet

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:08.610
close maybe but just a you know look at

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:10.500
it like three years from now Wow Enel

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.750
got a hit on this run why does even play

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.750
this game 10,000 hours I don't know why

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.920
I'm being so needlessly antagonistic

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.140
today there's no but it's because the

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:26.820
run actually is making me aggressive to

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:29.730
be honest a few more spirit hearts I

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.890
know we got two on the last floor I'm

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:35.370
not bitter that's a start

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.870
that's like probably slightly above the

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:39.780
average number of spirit arts you'd

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:43.440
expect to get per floor so thank you it

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:46.470
does not make up for five floors of

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.460
nothing but it's it does help and it

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:53.850
doesn't really matter what the average

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:57.990
is what matters is what showed up we're

00:23:53.850 --> 00:24:01.020
looking for spirit hearts I'm trying to

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:03.090
save and this might be backwards in

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:06.540
terms of what we should do but I'm

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:08.220
trying to save my invincibility charge

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:13.530
until we know that we're going to love

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:16.830
using it the main hopefully semi obvious

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:20.250
reason there being that illuminated bulb

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:23.399
is actually flipping sick

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.960
it's an awesome stance upgrade and in

00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:28.950
particular oil there we go

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.620
in particular we can use the speed and

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.330
the rate of fire increase so I'm

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.750
definitely not going to say no to this

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.980
if we can make it pop the Flies from

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:41.159
locusts of pestilence are really nice

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.779
yeah we've been pop it here the Flies

00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:48.919
from locust the pest ones are really

00:24:42.779 --> 00:24:48.919
nice especially with 22 damage but I'm

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:58.320
prioritizing basically it's not even

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:01.080
much of it tears upgrade but still a

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.980
little upgrade to every stat is pretty

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.950
nice I'm still holding out hope for nine

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.299
lives nine lives would be sick and

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.590
fairly likely we basically have a

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:14.700
guaranteed deal with the devil on this

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:17.129
floor and my clock upgrades what a cruel

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.149
joke we basically have a guaranteed deal

00:25:17.129 --> 00:25:20.100
with the devil because if we don't get a

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:25.379
deal with 60% then we're going to just

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:26.460
go use the Joker card but it'd be nice

00:25:25.379 --> 00:25:29.809
to get one on this floor and then we

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.809
have a guaranteed deal on the next floor

00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:39.330
yeah that was actually really dumb that

00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:42.929
was um stubbornness basically I chose

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:44.429
not to use Book of Shadows because I was

00:25:42.929 --> 00:25:47.759
like I want to keep my stats up grapes

00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:50.759
and then they just jumped on top of me

00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:52.860
which I should have known but okay HP

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:55.080
and tears this is actually really really

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:58.049
nice we've got two workable HP there and

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.509
then sake bus is lovely and we might as

00:25:58.049 --> 00:26:02.970
well take sack dagger for this permanent

00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:06.269
polaroid invincibility although you know

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.799
it does leave us on no rechargeable HP

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:11.370
but I think the permanent polaroid

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:14.519
invincibility is well worth it oh my

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:17.850
lord this run has no business being this

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:20.580
dangerous it's so good I would reroll

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:22.620
the whole thing sock it to me I would

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.139
take some spirit arts sock it to me I

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:27.210
don't know it's kind of tough we can

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:29.519
already fly I actually don't think it's

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:32.710
that tough we shouldn't take it one HP

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:34.820
is usually bad

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.960
when you when you already have permanent

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.200
Polaroid invincibility and you're not

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:46.700
like on the razor's edge which I hope

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:52.489
we're not but I guess you never know one

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:54.649
thing that rock / floor is not bad we

00:26:52.489 --> 00:26:56.840
could do better I might have to be wary

00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:57.739
though because I know my own self to

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.580
thine own self

00:26:57.739 --> 00:27:04.399
we truly should say that's really nice

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.169
actually so I know that there's a decent

00:27:04.399 --> 00:27:08.359
chance that I have just missed like 80

00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:11.389
tinted rocks and that's why I always you

00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:13.039
know at least lately my intention is not

00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:15.080
to say like the games not giving me

00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:17.029
tinted rocks but rather I'm not getting

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.980
into drugs as none of the games does

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:20.720
giving them I'm not getting them maybe

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.659
there's you know the mental postal

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.480
delivery service was posting the return

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:27.889
to sender accidentally maybe mental ups

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.609
called me and said hey there was nobody

00:27:27.889 --> 00:27:32.989
at your door when we tried to drop off

00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:34.369
the package so we had to take it back to

00:27:32.989 --> 00:27:36.019
the home base and I said oh really

00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:37.399
there's nobody at the door okay that

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:45.859
makes sense because I leave my house

00:27:37.399 --> 00:27:49.159
ever see you looting we're not going to

00:27:45.859 --> 00:27:52.039
fight Hache by the way you had any

00:27:49.159 --> 00:27:57.379
inclination that we're fighting OSH you

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:58.309
lost your gourd and we did get a deal

00:27:57.379 --> 00:27:59.929
with the devil which means guaranteed

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:03.320
deal with the devil on the cathedral all

00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:06.499
you got to go empty vessel bud that is

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.320
invincibility at the cost of like just a

00:28:06.499 --> 00:28:12.169
little bit of HP so I'm not worried at

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:15.220
all about that what I'm going to do is

00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:17.869
use the Joker card immediately

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.869
technically we could get HP that would

00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:23.419
make that devil deal take Abul first off

00:28:20.869 --> 00:28:27.739
we sort of don't want anything in there

00:28:23.419 --> 00:28:29.749
and then secondly was weird the shot

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:32.720
just hung in the air like tractor beam

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:34.510
keeps them all on a single line but keep

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.440
it in the air I don't know

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:40.300
[Music]

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.830
stationary either way uh we didn't want

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.630
anything in there to begin with plus the

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:49.270
odds are we probably just won't get any

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:50.680
extra HP take it guys so good okay so

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:55.660
we're gonna Emperor right now basically

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:59.350
try to get the heck out of this floor so

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.820
we're in a very very good spot except

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:04.030
for the fact that if anything ever

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:08.860
touches us I will be extremely close to

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:11.200
death so your mileage may vary it's it's

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.020
not an easy run it's a surprisingly

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:17.530
difficult run I'm very very don't insult

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.730
me I'm very very happy with the empty

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:22.950
vessel though it's already given us a

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:25.120
lot of invincibility and run some Valley

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.700
I'm going to take shielded tears even

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.040
though it's plausible we shouldn't mitre

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.590
is potentially incredible lifesteal and

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.030
mom's pad I can't imagine them being

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.710
good but we'll take mom's pad to see if

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:37.840
we get the transformation and then I

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:41.380
don't know cards I guess they can only

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:45.010
give us pills unless we have unless we

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.540
have a starter deck so I can't deny fast

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.670
run you know we just made it through the

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:53.200
last three floors in under six minutes

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:55.960
or something but you're going to have to

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.110
excuse me when I'm not that excited

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.950
about it because I'm extremely

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:02.440
frightened about the fact that if we

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.450
ever take a hit at all our chances of

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.770
winning go from like you know eighty

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:11.740
percent of fifty percent so screw that

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:14.650
all stats upgrade dude I think we should

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.630
be using invincibility constantly at

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.260
least on rooms in which we can't kill

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.260
everything immediately

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:27.610
succubus plus Polyphemus is like an

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:29.530
ideal pairing don't get me wrong i you

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:31.060
know i'm i welcome your judgment on this

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.870
run by the way especially now that it

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.480
looks like we're going to come through

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:36.670
with a win am i just actually losing it

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.390
did i squander way more HP than I than I

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.660
thought I did

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:43.870
or is this run like on the bottom you

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:45.700
know bottom third maybe of amount of

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:49.860
spirit arts that a run can drop because

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:54.250
I really feel my perception was like

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:56.440
good God his sort of screwed us on this

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.790
one and I don't know if we would have

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.980
been able to make this run work if we

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.970
didn't have Polyphemus or if he didn't

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.830
have the you know great stats regardless

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.570
I'm loving this expose Evo shielded

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.580
tears of course our rate of fire is not

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.620
amazing necessarily although it's pretty

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.590
good for having Polyphemus so when we

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.210
stick an enemy the shot has to not get

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.710
broken before we stick them but then

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:23.440
after that it's like a shield on top of

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:25.120
the enemy butter and I don't think the

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.300
only way I could see this being sweet

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.010
for us is if having no space bar item

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.960
counts as having a fully charged space

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.100
bar item for the purposes of illuminated

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.620
bulb but then we wouldn't have

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:40.540
illuminated bulb either

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:42.520
so you know kind of a confusing

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.810
situation there because we don't have

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.310
the ability to hold two trinkets but

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.290
we're going to get out of this you know

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.340
now again the run has done the thing

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.530
where it makes me look like a freaking

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.950
liar you know we've gotten such good

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.930
items

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.280
well not such good items necessarily

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.420
we've gotten so many spirit arts and

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.760
demon hearts that now it's like we're

00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.370
you complaining about anybody that just

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.750
flips to the last page of this audio

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.270
visual novel is going to be like oh

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:08.860
another easy run you don't know dude

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:12.990
you weren't there okay I was there I was

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.990
at the first can show in Cologne

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:20.330
we got going on here double monstro -

00:32:17.989 --> 00:32:22.729
don't make me laugh was your death

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:24.320
animation like a day and a half you can

00:32:22.729 --> 00:32:26.960
back up your whole hard drive on a

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.009
floppy diskette you're the biggest joke

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:33.739
on the Internet

00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:36.590
hey can you just stop moving for this

00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:38.929
Angry fly you do nothing except enable

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:47.330
Beelzebub just fart off okay this is my

00:32:38.929 --> 00:32:49.549
run off oh now you're making me mad good

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:52.669
69 item that's not even close to looking

00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:56.599
like an actual 69 or looking like a fool

00:32:52.669 --> 00:33:00.409
with pants on the ground yeah you know

00:32:56.599 --> 00:33:05.659
what soymilk Polyphemus with shielded

00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:09.200
piers and explosive Oh actually I think

00:33:05.659 --> 00:33:11.869
this might be incredible even though it

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.570
sort of looks like it's substantially

00:33:11.869 --> 00:33:19.999
worse I think in terms of the actual you

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:21.679
know time to kill it's not worse and I

00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:24.289
think especially against like high

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:25.070
damage enemies it might actually be much

00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:31.359
much better

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:33.679
oh we do lose a lot of damage when we

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:36.139
let me get out of illuminated bulb

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:38.119
territory but it's really like you know

00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:41.029
we pay a high upfront cost to stack

00:33:38.119 --> 00:33:42.440
these explosive Oh shots but then the

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:45.649
expletive Oh shots don't do a lot of

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:49.239
damage individually but there's so many

00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:49.239
of them that there's like a Mass Effect

00:33:50.769 --> 00:33:58.279
now the scary thing always always is

00:33:56.299 --> 00:33:59.720
that we could have the opportunity to go

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:01.269
to the void floor I think I would be

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.529
fine fighting delirium right now

00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:05.779
especially if we like to get endless

00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:10.599
explosive Oh stacks up and do the

00:34:05.779 --> 00:34:10.599
explosive like sticky

00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:16.929
know as no delirium the explosive sticky

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.700
shields are so good there anyway that

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.200
rum is fun at the end but started a

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.489
little sketchy for now that 17 in a row
