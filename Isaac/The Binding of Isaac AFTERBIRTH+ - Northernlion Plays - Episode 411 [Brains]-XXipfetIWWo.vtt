00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
hey everybody welcome a foreign land

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.520
please the binding of issac afterbirth

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.240
Plus and why I said that like an

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.890
auctioneer

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
well hey pretty handsome will you give

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.690
me a CD that do anything that is in

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.480
greed I do the brains and do the pride

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.609
day - that's John Michael Montgomery

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.640
sold to the lady in the second row she's

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.600
an 8 she's a 9 she's a 10 I know Oh No

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:28.019
VN WD 0 y GF pardon me it's disgusting I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.720
don't pride myself on burping oK we've

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.329
been down this road many a time I when I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.850
burp it's a 100% involuntary I will

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.530
never push out a voluntary burp live on

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.230
camera I hate it we are well I must be

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.230
level with you I forgot what the brains

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.780
challenge was what it is is you get

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.809
three Bob's brain but no tears why can't

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.460
you have no Bob's brain but three tears

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.020
I think that this run is largely and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.129
remember I've played it for about 35

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.850
seconds so far but I think it's largely

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.740
dependent on what kind of rooms we get

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.920
if we get rooms with a lot of enemies

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.170
who rush us down bad time to be us if we

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.979
get rooms with like single enemies that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.630
that aren't really that mobile I'm

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.590
relatively unconcerned say it like the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.119
less enemies on a room the better and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.750
the slower those enemies are the better

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.430
but dude we actually crushed Ragman

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
there which is not a common occurrence

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.460
do we get red hearts we do not wear blue

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
baby as well all right noted I'm not

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.850
gonna care at all about the curse room

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.829
this run goes all the way by the way I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.899
kind of like that although you might

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.149
think that it's in elegant I kind of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.899
like that the harder challenges in the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.130
game seem to go further works the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.799
opposite of the way that you would

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.990
normally expect and again I think I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.670
think I appreciate that because it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.700
backwards and then sometimes so am I so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.680
I'll use a bomb just to check you know

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.020
what with this much HP I will actually

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.020
use HP to go and check

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.290
this is a tough one I don't think the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.680
poop is that good as far as the spacebar

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.580
item goes I do think seven seals is well

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.380
worth it though

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.580
but I don't think taking both I think

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.560
was too dangerous

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.420
I was kind of hoping we'd get like I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.650
think we did get a better spacebar item

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.840
than the poop we just couldn't afford to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.330
take it because the the passive item was

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.739
even better seven seals is like I think

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.570
I under eight it just because I'm

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.510
skeptical of new items but it really is

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.790
like not necessarily a ten out of ten

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.680
but good enough to be excited about

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.390
getting even at a cost of three spirit

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.200
arts which is normally fairly

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.930
prohibitive come on come on

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.459
thank plus when enemies are rushing is

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.459
down like that it gives us a way out

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.260
we do have to be wary though because

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:15.460
there are like the war flies explode so

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.500
we're kind of looking for like do all

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.250
the flies explode we're kind of looking

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.380
for like a 10 out of 10 defensive item

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.990
for example if we could get like luck

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:35.080
plus gimpy luck is the most worthwhile

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:37.990
upgrade we could ever choose speed could

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.080
be as good as luck it's the luckiest

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.850
stuff Ritson see up I'm a little cheesed

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.850
by the way about how is it started um

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.620
thank you just less war please less war

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.100
the pajamas are 10 out of 10 here less

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.930
war more death we got so many exploding

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.060
flies that we had basically no chance to

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.420
avoid I wasn't joking by the way like

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.880
speed upgrades actually really thought

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.340
we had strafed far enough speed upgrades

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.330
could be all important for us who lose

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.470
clothes as well luck is actually not all

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.850
important until we get given as

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.830
operating under the assumption that's a

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.590
guarantee which it obviously isn't but

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.450
yeah this challenge is also no joke if I

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.669
remember correctly we might have had to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.650
do this one a few times at least a

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.419
couple of times when afterbirth came out

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.660
but that's not bad actually burnt penny

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.660
giving us

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.540
burnt penny giving us a chance to get

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:55.520
bombs whenever we pick up any money is

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:59.270
fairly solid we can use those bombs for

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.080
combat related circumstances because

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.120
sometimes we're not going to once what a

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.390
whiff sometimes we're not gonna want to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.010
spend Bob's brain because Bob's brain

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:20.480
will kill us just to exist that's a hit

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:22.250
come on I will check this quickly it's a

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.350
bit of a tough call honestly I'm gonna

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.850
go with a humbling bundle cuz I think

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.330
the amount of money it will give us long

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:34.010
term is really good but a spirit heart

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.530
and a key and the one tool three let's

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.240
go no but a spirit heart and a key and

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.700
whatever that tarot card was could have

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.190
been like really nice as well but when

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:49.220
in doubt tend to err on the side maybe

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:51.590
of help me it's war so be careful but I

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.920
tend to err on the side of the long term

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.750
upgrade I think it's all worth it for

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:02.830
that single black heart there just watch

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.830
out cuz this fly is rigged to explode

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.740
what's funny is that actually a lot of

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.400
these bosses are a lot easier as a

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.340
result of our loadout the triple Bob's

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:22.300
brain saw the triple Bob's brain setup

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:24.220
but it is frustrating when you more

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.050
severe at heart sadly it is frustrating

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.310
when you run out of Bob's brains and

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.870
you're like well but did a lot of damage

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.660
now I just got to sit back and wait for

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.340
anything at all I guess we're on the

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.350
caves too though five minutes in so

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:41.050
that's a pretty easy indication that

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.420
this runs popping off do we control

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.140
seven seals I've never actually thought

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.910
about it like maybe no answer my own

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.280
question I thought maybe we could keep

00:06:48.910 --> 00:07:00.010
ourselves like permanently Conquest it

00:06:51.280 --> 00:07:01.660
up does not appear so because even

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.600
though we've done nothing there we

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.610
haven't we have changed the horsemen or

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.020
rather the horsemen has changed so I'm

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.550
assuming it's just like an interval

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.080
thing we should not have stepped on that

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.780
I wasn't even thinking about it until

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:18.400
after it happened but definitely should

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.870
not have stepped on that I still think

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.190
that as good as this run might look

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:27.610
right now in the fact though we're going

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:30.820
very fast you're not wrong the the Run

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:34.300
has a life expectancy unless we can get

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.250
some way to generate spirit hearts so

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.810
you know on the last run we had this

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.030
book of revelations that we never used

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:44.380
if we could just like green sea through

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:46.330
time and perhaps come back to that run

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.040
and grab the Book of Revelations bring

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.260
it into this run it started to feel a

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.980
lot more confident I think about my my

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.980
chances of success

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:01.410
but as of right now I don't think we're

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:05.070
like close to failure I mean literally

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.330
we don't have a lot of tolerance before

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.830
things are gonna start to look pretty

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:12.270
bad but I think we got a reasonable

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:18.210
amount of time before things become

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:19.490
truly terrible that's the dream at least

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.530
[Music]

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.480
don't step on those like if we could get

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.020
a deal with the devil on this floor that

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.550
gave us

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:31.200
Abaddon plus gimpy that would be good

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:35.010
why Abaddon well Abaddon is like an

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.469
engine that's gonna hurt oh my god the

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.180
ideal death card at exactly the right

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:41.969
time

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:44.730
whoo Abaddon allows us to pay for that

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:46.410
deal without dying which we presently do

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.090
not have the ability to do so it would

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.160
be nice thank you for the spirit heart

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.760
buddy I really appreciate that it's just

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.130
what I needed

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:57.630
I mean it's someone I don't remember the

00:08:53.130 --> 00:09:00.390
rest of the lyrics when it comes to cars

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:04.020
songs I was always more of like a here

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:08.190
in my car this is not by the cars it's

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:11.460
by Gary Numan but not the Gary new men

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:16.470
who made Garry's Mod doot doot doot doot

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:19.650
doot doot here in my mod I can play prop

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:25.730
UNT's trouble in terrorist town

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:25.730
there's myriad games in my mod

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:32.540
doo-doo-doo-doo anyway that's a

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:35.430
roundabout joke about the existence of

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:38.640
Garry's Mod apparently I don't have

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:40.080
anything against Garry's Mod if I said

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.750
you had a nice mud would you hold it

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.990
against me

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:48.959
[Music]

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:52.800
I don't like that good shot good shot

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:58.459
good shot we should probably wait until

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.459
we get at least one Bob's brain back

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.480
there we go

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.430
all right dude those two I mean we've

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.800
got 13 bombs we might as well check some

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:11.250
of these little opportunities over here

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.230
for anything at all really spirit arts

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.700
primarily this is not a run in which

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.620
we're looking to really ball out of

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:22.740
control there are items that would fit

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:24.540
the bill for us like if we could get we

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.089
can get any kind of sad bombs for

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:30.690
example dude the Harbinger is crushing

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:32.310
it I don't know why I said any kind of

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.290
sad bombs if we can get the item

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:40.110
literally known as sad bombs that would

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:42.750
be nice I will take Guppies tail I don't

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.130
really know why even as I was picking it

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.560
up I was saying to myself why would you

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.959
do this especially not having you know

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.399
really confidence and going to the curse

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:53.940
rooms it seems like a little bit of a

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:56.240
bizarre choice but here we are here we

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.240
all are

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:08.670
okay straight up I think you have to

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:10.589
consider that 18 bombs might be enough

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.110
for all we need for the rest of the game

00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:15.839
with all these bombs brains that we have

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:19.020
on the other hand our holy mantle

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:23.120
trinket that gives us one protection per

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:27.300
floor once we get down to the womb of

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.550
which there are two Sheol and then dark

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.839
room that could be worth four spirit

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.370
hearts in and of itself not to mention

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.540
like what it's protecting us from on

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.640
this floor we've already been hit once

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.079
so it only gives you the protection once

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:41.459
per floor but still that's pretty good I

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:43.500
guess the idea of giving you thunder

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:45.829
thighs is that now that I think about it

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.660
at least you're probably supposed to use

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:50.220
thunder thighs are sorry you're probably

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.860
posed to use the poop to block enemies

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.360
from hitting you but then you can't trap

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.170
yourself in the corner with it because

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.899
they give you the

00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:00.359
thunder thighs to step on it I think I

00:11:56.899 --> 00:12:05.699
think I understand where I'm starting to

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:06.959
understand at least I'm not really using

00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:14.790
it like that I'm using it more like you

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:18.359
use Wooden Nickel in a keeper run for

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:20.359
better or for worse well it's quite a

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:24.379
lot of money

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:24.379
BFF would be an okay pickup

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:28.970
apart from that I'm still working

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:33.439
obviously pyro

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.439
pyromaniac rather is like Tanana ten

00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:42.689
Maggie's faith or the prayer card yes

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:45.059
it's one spear at our per floor that's

00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:47.189
at something combine that with the

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:50.129
effects of our like pseudo holy mantle

00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:51.689
here and we're cooking with gas right so

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:55.309
we got Tammy's head Tammy's head means

00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:55.309
almost nothing for us right now

00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:03.869
justice strength

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:06.209
High Priestess Tammy's head versus

00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:07.829
jarrah flies I think you gotta go jar

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:15.149
flies I know we went with this on our

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:16.679
last round as well but run Oh as long as

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:18.809
we can be in it it definitely appears

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:23.689
like we can as long as we can use jar of

00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:26.040
flies with Bob's brain like Bob's brain

00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:26.759
going off triggers jar flies then I

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.259
think we're good

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:32.429
please don't make any more of those

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:35.009
thank you and by good I mean we'll

00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:37.589
survive a floor anything beyond that is

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:39.689
kind of like gravy at this point but I'm

00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:42.059
not gonna go to the secret earth sorry

00:13:39.689 --> 00:13:47.459
to the curse room it's just not the

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:50.160
right call I think we could do so for a

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:53.549
half spirit art by using the strength

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.739
card but even then the I I think like

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:58.889
half a spirit art might be a little too

00:13:55.739 --> 00:14:00.629
valuable to justify and these challenges

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:02.789
I kind of I got lacks today's achill I

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:04.259
think at the the end of the rebirth

00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:07.199
challenges I was like most of these are

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:08.700
pretty easy they are no longer pretty

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.960
easy every ever

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.550
single one of them is bringing like its

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.790
own unique brand the heat it's like I'm

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:17.010
on hot ones people sometimes ask NL

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.320
would you go on hot ones the show with

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.300
hot questions and even hotter wings why

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.610
not you know it seems like a fun and

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.620
affable time now I will say the time for

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.300
me to be on hot ones was probably season

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.460
1 cuz they're getting like their book

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.470
and big stars now I got no chance and

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.950
I'm aware of that fact fundamentally

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:37.590
speaking but they ever do like a like a

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.420
baby hot ones like like the host takes

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.400
six months off but they still want to

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.380
continue to keep the revenue stream open

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.870
keep me in mind you know I think I'd be

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.790
a good interview I I'll answer your

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:53.160
questions honestly and I'm not afraid to

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:57.180
buy back my man plus I don't back down

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.160
from the spice am i a spice Lord can't

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.750
take it oh well no we can't take it I

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.090
was getting it confused with contract

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:07.170
from below I'm not a chilly head as they

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:09.900
say I do like hot sauce that's not a

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.030
concern and I'm not like I eat white

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.530
rice and I go can I get this in a mild

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.760
you could bring me a glass of coconut

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.740
milk please

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.420
but certainly I'm not like a I love you

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.130
open my pantry you've got Dave's you

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.580
know butthole cleanser that's not the

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.280
case

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:26.010
but I don't back down from a little hot

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.360
sauce actually again because I've told

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:30.390
every story I've ever had in my entire

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.920
life on this show already you may have

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.660
heard this one already but one time

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.190
Michael al Fox and I may have been a

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.730
little bit under the influence but we

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:41.460
went to a bar that had a wing night and

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:43.410
it was like 1:00 p.m. but went to a bar

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:47.100
that had a wing 24-hour period

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:48.780
apparently or I guess and they were like

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.450
hey for like 15 bucks it's

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.640
all-you-can-eat wings so as long as you

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.980
continue to give us empty plates we'll

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.260
continue to give you more chicken wings

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:01.770
like six at a time to your desired level

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.510
of spice so I got six hot wings a dove

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.770
no problem I was like any chance you can

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.000
make them like extra spicy and they're

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.100
like sure no problem

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.630
came out eight six more of them I'm not

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.760
gonna say no problem because I don't

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:14.970
recall I'm assuming again a certain

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.290
level of the chemical concentration and

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.890
my bloodstream may have affected that to

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:22.620
some degree do as I say not as I do and

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:24.120
then I sent them back and I was

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.300
like give me the hottest wings you have

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.510
and Michael al Fox was not there

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.650
actually but he organized the whole

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.510
get-together another mutual friend of

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.920
ours was there he was just shaking his

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:39.090
head probably because I'm an idiot and

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.310
then they brought out something that

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:44.370
basically smelled like you know police

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.900
grade pepper spray and they came back

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.550
and they're like how is it and it was

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.450
like it was good

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:55.370
oh very nice but yeah I didn't finish

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:58.410
that plate it was it was not very good

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.910
because it was poison deliberately is

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.570
I'm not blaming them it was pretty much

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:06.140
my own fault 100% I just couldn't leave

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.140
well enough alone

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:14.640
[Music]

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.950
well we have 81 cents so I will buy a

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.800
champion belt I will buy this I will buy

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:22.350
the compass I will buy this card and are

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.810
we on we are on the dentist too so we

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:29.490
actually could cheat our way out of boss

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:31.770
rush and honestly that has my hopes up

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:35.250
because boss rush is probably like our

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.720
best opportunity to get a crack at an

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.160
item that would change the game for us

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.300
because you get four pedestal well you

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.190
actually you could get two to eight

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:45.720
pedestals rather I'm still stoked to be

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.630
getting damage upgrades even though they

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.330
might seem inconsequential I'm assuming

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:56.910
that there's a chance that the flies

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:58.830
from seven seals break it please what's

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.230
in the world thank you

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.820
there's a chance that those flies

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:06.870
inherit that damage in some direction

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:08.580
some capacity I should say also there's

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.320
my own flies from jar of flies which

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.910
definitely do as well we're not

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.240
generating too many and the reason we're

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:17.040
not generating too many is because

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.450
honestly like the harbingers are too

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:24.590
good as long as we're talking about like

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:29.570
quality problems to have

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:32.799
I basically just need the Dodge and the

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.799
harbingers we'll figure out the rest

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:38.000
here a font ten out of ten I know I've

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.440
been saying that a lot recently just

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.630
trying to find some numeric way to

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.970
quantify my joy of discovering this item

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:49.400
to a spades uh irrelevant I'll tell you

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:52.309
what as a show of gratitude for having

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.320
given me so many hearts here let's go

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:56.059
check out our curse room where we're

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.460
going to fight Krampus and hopefully

00:18:56.059 --> 00:19:01.580
he'll die like right now otherwise we're

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.200
in for a nightmare time and it's not

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.470
even close to well it's kind of close to

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:10.100
Halloween I guess lump of coal also not

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:12.620
worth much we're still at six spirit

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:15.919
hearts and this is all run like this

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:18.110
this ends when a run normally ends so we

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:24.260
got a lot of life ahead of us

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:27.610
fortunately it's a beautiful day don't

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:30.970
get hit by Bob's brains beautiful day

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:33.770
you know most people aren't crazy about

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:35.210
new ish you two I recognize that for

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.770
many of you that song probably came out

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.510
when you were zero years old but for me

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.630
you know it's after you two took a

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:45.710
hiatus after Achtung Baby or whatever

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:48.799
I still think beautiful day is an okay

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:51.260
song but I'm on the u2 apologist

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:52.039
apparent everybody else is like have you

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.950
seen South Park

00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:56.510
I hate Bono he has big poops I think

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.070
Bono's a little pretentious but say

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.260
you're allowed to be pretentious when

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.270
you've donated like hundreds of millions

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.429
of dollars to charity everyone wants

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.200
like this guy who's like hey by the way

00:20:04.429 --> 00:20:08.510
I think that like AIDS is the biggest

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.159
problem facing the world and I'm doing a

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.659
lot about it but I'm not gonna be

00:20:10.159 --> 00:20:14.779
pretentious so just say hey cool

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:16.399
whatever you say dude I don't know if

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:19.669
technology zero is gonna do anything for

00:20:16.399 --> 00:20:22.640
us I'm not trying to defend him for

00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:24.169
being pretentious because I would like

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.000
to think that if I had Bill Gates money

00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:27.830
I would just give like a billion dollars

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.830
to a cause and then be like add don't

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:34.940
worry about it I handled it but I also I

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:37.850
think the people are like yeah he

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:40.490
donated a hundred million dollars the

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:42.860
AIDS relief but at the same time he's

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:45.200
kind of a jerk so I think that relative

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.080
balance is self out he's like a zero in

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.390
most people's heads because he's

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.020
philanthropic but he just won't shut up

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:57.919
about it but admittedly most of the

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.390
reason I cut bono some slack for that is

00:20:57.919 --> 00:21:01.090
because I still think pride in the name

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:05.289
of love is like a ten out of ten song

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:07.669
one of the best rock songs of the 1980s

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:11.240
Joshua Tree is a great album you choose

00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:12.530
not my favorite band ever especially

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.480
like almost everything that they've done

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:21.980
since the year 2000 I've kind of hated

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:23.929
but you know between like 1980 and 1995

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.620
all they all give them a pass no

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:29.780
question we got a check at this point

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.299
you know we stand nothing we stand to

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:36.200
gain nothing by rushing we have our holy

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:39.309
mantle active as of yet so might as well

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:42.169
continue to kind of press forward and

00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:43.580
maybe through the other directions as

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:47.929
well if we want to deal damage

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:51.230
effectively we need sad bombs at this

00:21:47.929 --> 00:21:53.990
point because with static tears sad

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.520
bombs would be even stronger in fact we

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.380
in the hindsight we should have stuck

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.730
with Tammy's head but there was no way

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:03.500
for us to know that in advance and jar

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.630
of flies is still very good as well I

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.100
just I kind of overestimated what jar of

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.990
flies would do because most of our

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.210
damage is being done by the harbingers

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.190
so the one decision we made

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:17.750
doubtlessly correct on this run was

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:19.880
taking seven seals like without that it

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.590
would be in a much tighter spot yeah yet

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.650
another like semi difficult challenge

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:27.250
it's going quite well right now but you

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.250
know things can change

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.610
made a lot more HP than me lost there I

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:41.500
don't want to reroll my whole run not on

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:43.270
a challenge at least one bomb for two

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.400
keys cut the kind of trade that could be

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.929
relevant one day but not in you know

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.910
challenge city where the grass is green

00:22:46.929 --> 00:22:50.440
and the girls are pretty similarly

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.840
speaking very sorry about this but

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.520
mostly we just I mean the spirit hearts

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.470
glory is but also I just want that extra

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.020
deal with the devil chance similarly

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.160
very sorry about this oh that right it

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.610
doesn't give you any more after that

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.610
that's correct

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:17.580
boom bowl mix a lot of movies most of

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:19.289
them are a little poopy Hoover Bowl

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:24.179
why don't I pronounce your name like you

00:23:19.289 --> 00:23:25.619
bowled just cuz I can't get the song by

00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:28.529
Aerosmith out of my head there don't

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:30.599
rank down home come on up and see me I

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:32.099
always say my head's always like

00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:34.700
bustling with parodies and I was like

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:39.869
what rhymes with doll well kind of like

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:43.079
bowl cute like a bubble made a film

00:23:39.869 --> 00:23:46.200
about blood rain over bowl put the

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:47.669
critics through pain over bone sees the

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.339
guy the German director made all those

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:53.669
movies Oh

00:23:49.339 --> 00:23:56.429
guppies power will become a kitty say

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:59.459
this run from being hey now you can't

00:23:56.429 --> 00:24:01.799
say that on YouTube in 2017 God please

00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:03.719
Powell never gonna do me never do me

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:05.399
never gonna do me never gonna do me

00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:09.349
never do me never dummy like you're

00:24:05.399 --> 00:24:09.349
never gonna do me never do me before

00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:18.509
Aerosmith man dude give me bono over

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:20.700
Steven Tyler any day of the week dude is

00:24:18.509 --> 00:24:22.859
like 60 years old he made a tweet that

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.509
said ladies as long as I still have this

00:24:22.859 --> 00:24:26.579
face you'll always have a place to sit

00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:30.929
that's just like I'm not trying to be

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:31.320
negative about you know biology I'm just

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:34.859
saying

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.269
dad who let you out of your home you're

00:24:34.859 --> 00:24:41.940
not supposed to be tweeting vile stuff

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:44.459
like that on judge's orders right but

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:47.639
bottles kind of pretentious so I will

00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:50.519
I'll meet you halfway there well I mean

00:24:47.639 --> 00:24:52.519
this it's causing me some problems I'm

00:24:50.519 --> 00:24:57.469
sorry I shot at my my friend their

00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:57.469
paralysis huh well

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:04.490
this is a debatably pretty bad decision

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:11.480
admittedly let me out for free please

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:12.980
I will check for red Ches I will still

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.870
go for it cuz we haven't seen Guppies

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.370
head right all right no we haven't seen

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:20.780
Guppies say we I mean we didn't get it

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:22.910
here either way but as much as this

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:30.500
sounds like way too much work we should

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:34.280
actually try to last-hit cuz if we can

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.560
last hit we get flies back are we

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.150
getting doubled oh no I was never mind I

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.500
was gonna say I know we had we have car

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.630
battery on this run to the last run

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.610
either way I thought we were getting two

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.470
flies maybe we get two flies from bosses

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.300
and one fly from non bosses

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.530
I thought maybe car battery it obviously

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.630
doesn't give you double the flies for

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.070
maybe you could gain the flies twice as

00:25:50.630 --> 00:26:00.860
quickly which would comp or something

00:25:52.070 --> 00:26:05.530
sort of similar shot nice shot we're

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.530
good and the blister not very good

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:17.150
acceptable oh you're burning the other

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:26.700
even like at this point an orbital would

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:30.500
be pretty good any enemy that has to be

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.500
hit quickly is a real problem right now

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:39.000
not as much of a problem as these guys

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:40.440
are good pill please infested great pill

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.140
on a room with poop but apparently those

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.900
poops don't count my mistake still get a

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:50.610
long and winding road in front of us

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:54.510
here next floor is gonna be Scholl we're

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:56.900
getting a little like trying not to lose

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.900
focus

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:13.060
good good good good flies good flies

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:15.760
more bombs brains please come on just

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.830
crush him you got flies you got the

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.330
ability Creed flies over there you

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.690
waiting on me to do your dirty work for

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.690
you

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:29.410
good job you finished it off there's no

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.480
way we're going to the hush fight that

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.980
would be madness instead we went up to

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.480
the Cathedral wait a minute okay so this

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:40.450
is one that goes to the chest not the

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:44.080
dark room we do want to potential we

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:46.150
want to potentially stop by the mob trap

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.960
room in case there's red chests or stone

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:53.200
chests or golden chests really any

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:55.060
chests except for default in mimic one

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.980
stone chest I don't think does it for me

00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:04.330
though I'm I don't think it's quite

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:07.840
strong enough evey for me to justify

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:09.880
going in there what if it has guppy

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.290
everyone's genius what if it has guppy

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.100
what if it doesn't how about that you

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.100
ever consider that one

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:25.170
good work keep it up

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.660
proud of you that why go this way it was

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:30.390
like very apparent this was less likely

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.880
to be the right direction still got it

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.920
done I'm not going back for that I'll go

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:40.740
back for it zero point seven speed is

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:43.050
bad though it was it wasn't worth it

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:49.530
except that we didn't get hit by not

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:55.170
getting hit we made it worth it landed

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:59.790
one yes landed two got three let's uh

00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:02.630
let's use bombs to get this young nasty

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.630
man out of here

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:22.090
yeah it's working I mean we don't we

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:24.249
don't need the bombs so wasting some

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.659
means nothing and I mean sure we took a

00:29:24.249 --> 00:29:27.489
little damage there we got more back but

00:29:25.659 --> 00:29:33.849
that was it would have been better if it

00:29:27.489 --> 00:29:35.940
had not gone exactly that way get these

00:29:33.849 --> 00:29:45.239
explosive flies out of here please

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:51.009
there we go no no no no perks great pill

00:29:45.239 --> 00:29:53.379
we've almost got this one just keep your

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:58.799
head on a swivel slightly longer the

00:29:53.379 --> 00:30:02.289
next one is Pride Day I can't remember

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:04.419
specifically what that one is but I

00:30:02.289 --> 00:30:05.769
almost remember like we're coming into

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:09.309
the point where my memory can actually

00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:11.080
access data that far back because it's

00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:12.549
relatively recent as compared to rebirth

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:17.529
challenges at least to stand right in

00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:20.019
the middle good choice I've remembered

00:30:17.529 --> 00:30:22.690
being not a hard challenge this one I

00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:24.940
remember being a bit of a hard challenge

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:29.080
and I think that that you know it's

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:31.419
basically fit the bill here the real

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.539
bummer is no BFF like if we get BFF on

00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:40.619
this one bosses are dying in like two

00:30:34.539 --> 00:30:40.619
hits bad damage unfortunately

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.420
Harbinger is crushing it though I just

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.820
wish you'd crushed it a little bit more

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.190
frequently

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.620
get out of here orange fly I don't want

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:56.690
you how come he don't want me man maybe

00:30:54.620 --> 00:31:02.290
because you explode next to me as soon

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:03.650
as you see an enemy nearly kill me dude

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.440
all right

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.210
Kurt's probably for a room that's tough

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.040
already but this would be a great time

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:15.260
to just get some good items right off

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:17.210
the bat not it not it not it so none of

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.310
these do anything for us almost unless

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:22.610
they give us stat changes that we can

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:24.290
benefit from so I'm actually gonna get

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.540
rid of Jarrah flies for forget-me-now

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:32.780
basically trade Jarrah flies for four

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:38.120
more items still like largely not very

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:38.630
good but we did get a spear and heart

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.610
out of it

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:44.240
I will stand by that being the right

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:47.740
decision range down irrelevant health up

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.740
very very relevant

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.329
[Music]

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:02.690
I'm just gonna call it like I see it by

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:04.460
the way I think we kind of and I still

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:09.400
think we have a good chance to win we've

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:11.539
kind of gotten screwed on this run like

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.490
especially on this room particular it's

00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:16.520
really highlighting it what am I

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:20.630
supposed to do we have 0.7 speed and we

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:22.940
can only shoot three Bob's brains so we

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.520
do have 30 bombs we have 30 default

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:30.020
bombs I will never deny the existence of

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:33.649
those but I am kind of at a loss for

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:36.200
like what my alternative abilities to

00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:44.419
deal damage are bulgar tears don't do

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:48.260
anything for us kind of trapped in here

00:32:44.419 --> 00:32:53.480
I can't believe we got out don't be

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:56.380
afraid to save some bombs you might need

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:59.960
those to slow war down

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:06.740
NoHo Ruka I'm sorry I woke you up but

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:11.029
this is getting very harrowing the tower

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:13.659
card well we get a spirit heart if we

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:13.659
kill you last

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:23.100
now hook get out of here you are an

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:27.470
actual jerk okay I don't like to use the

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.470
J word lightly but you deserved it there

00:33:29.059 --> 00:33:38.750
please please just how can you miss

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:44.480
targets like this this quick like this

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:44.480
frequently they're huge destroy them

00:33:51.920 --> 00:34:00.529
so what's the game plan very simple

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:05.509
don't get hit make it to the blue baby

00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:09.290
fight use perks on the blue baby fight

00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:10.879
perks and recreation it's a long way to

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.369
the top though if we want to rock and

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:15.700
roll we got several rooms to go but I

00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:19.010
think we're probably going the right way

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:22.000
it is nice we kind of got like a little

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:25.099
baseline for our damage there apparently

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.940
three Bob's brains is exactly enough to

00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:34.669
kill a boss nothing but I'm not gonna

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:37.550
actually be upset about getting nothing

00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:39.950
from a boss at this point because the

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.990
alternative is less likely to be getting

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:43.909
something and more likely to be taking

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:44.329
damage how do you thread the needle like

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.599
that

00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:52.149
that's actually upsetting thank you

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:54.440
thank you for the Flies what is this

00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:59.900
you guys are you're in the wrong video

00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:01.819
game 16 bombs left try to split the

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.829
difference please no enemies that rush

00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:05.560
us thank you we got we chose the right

00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:08.839
direction

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.480
we're not hit by an exploding fly but I

00:35:08.839 --> 00:35:13.700
walked into a single shot

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:16.130
they don't make them as disappointed as

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.700
I am right now anymore what expression

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.700
makes no sense

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:25.119
[Music]

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:25.119
not like this you got to hit the flies

00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:33.380
this should be an easy issue keep the

00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:35.739
flies obey let the Harb Harbinger do

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.739
what it does

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:50.490
the missus are stacking up and they're

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:53.570
making me sad no exploding flies please

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.570
[Music]

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:12.180
sorry this requires extreme focus quiet

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:14.880
for the runner please just a single

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:17.610
spirit heart that's it that's all we

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:20.610
need to give us a good shot as is we're

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:27.990
playing low-percentage sports here hey

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:32.430
get this fly out of here speed up is

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:34.860
actually real nice we're gonna try for

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:37.050
secret rooms which is debatably kind of

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.820
a bad decision with our limited amount

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:42.010
of remaining HP

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.010
[Music]

00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:53.430
while we looked so get this exploding

00:36:52.319 --> 00:36:58.709
fly out of here please

00:36:53.430 --> 00:37:04.979
thank you why pop hurts because why not

00:36:58.709 --> 00:37:16.069
is the the real reason does nothing for

00:37:04.979 --> 00:37:19.529
us but nothing against us either oh I

00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:20.670
actually am mad okay we throw away some

00:37:19.529 --> 00:37:22.859
HP that we shouldn't have thrown away

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.869
but we also straight up I think we got

00:37:22.859 --> 00:37:25.920
garbage on that run either way thanks

00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:27.599
