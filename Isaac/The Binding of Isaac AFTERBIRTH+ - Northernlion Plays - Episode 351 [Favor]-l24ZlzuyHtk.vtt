00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.080
hey everybody welcome back northernlion

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.779
the binding of issac entereth plus what

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
more do you need what more can you say

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.710
what'd you say this is how this is

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.460
lameee prof exercise to start out every

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.020
episode just rapid-fire references as if

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:24.350
Oh an Isaac run now we can get serious

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.029
old uh-oh jabo slide zeros in this one

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.170
you know what they say you three zeros

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.510
makes one hero look at the quick think

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.030
of a superhero as three O's in his name

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.870
Thor Thor Thor alright let's get going

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.180
here the last run was I wish this item

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.780
was better these sinks is just so much

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.120
cooler anyway the last run was like

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.980
pretty close to a 10 out of 10 if it had

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.530
more HP earlier would have been a 10 out

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.239
of 10 but it was still like a super easy

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.859
win by the time you got Judas to shatter

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.230
to pop and it was nice because again

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.390
recording this one right after like I'm

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.390
still out of practice I've been been

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.560
away from the game for a week you know

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.290
just because we had one run in which we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.939
succeeded while having 70 damage doesn't

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.939
necessarily mean we're good to go here

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.820
all things considered I would imagine

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.780
anyway so I'm hoping to keep things

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.369
going here I wish I had more like

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.110
anecdotes I really don't have more

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.070
anecdotes from my time away though

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.720
there's it was it was a domestic trip I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.840
actually did a little embarrassing but

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.880
what did I do with my time away well you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.530
know my parents mostly were hanging out

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.479
they had the week off as well so they

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.759
were just watching like a bunch of

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.000
they're really into these like

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.350
Scandinavian crime shows on Netflix and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.250
I'm not against it you know it's it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.229
oftentimes very good like we watched

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.920
this Swedish movie called a man called

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.719
Alva and I did implicitly say it in that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.049
voice for some reason which I apologize

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.570
for um which is not a crime movie but I

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.250
was like this is good this is a good

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.860
movie I never would have seen were not

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090
for their influence

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.360
they are like watching a lot of those so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.220
now

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.960
I really want to watch you know like 12

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.920
episodes of case so instead I spent a

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.330
lot of time it's kind of programming as

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.910
lame as that might sound to you to go on

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.230
vacation and then you know spend a lot

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.900
of time writing code that's basically

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.540
what happened and I wrote like it's bad

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.360
I want to put that out there and it may

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.390
or may not ever see the light of day but

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.170
it is actually technically probably

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.340
releasable I made a game with the name

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.190
Tomo Quest using you know prolific use

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.040
of free assets from the unity asset

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.400
store just basically like a really

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.440
really rudimentary endless runner that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.480
took me an embarrassingly long time to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.850
cobble together and it doesn't it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.980
doesn't like look or play that well but

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:10.590
my god it actually first off runs on my

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.239
phone which is a huge milestone for me

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.920
I've never deployed anything to my own

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.840
phone before and then been able to play

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.750
it and then show with the people Israel

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.310
hey check this out I made this and I'm

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.170
like no no is not but you don't

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.650
understand this is an important step to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.620
be able to do that and then also like it

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.350
just works it has like a UI you can use

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.459
buttons to navigate to the mode you want

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.140
to play and then you can play it and

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.290
then you can hit restart and continue to

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.709
play it it's got a high score list I

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.120
wrote myself despite the fact that you

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.560
should never do that surely there's

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.110
plugins that can just do that for you

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.850
and instead I'm you know writing my own

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.310
lists in the in the background every

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.049
time you finish a run and get a score oh

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.790
my god it's just like make me work for

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.280
it a little bit here so yeah I don't

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.110
know if that's ever gonna like come out

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.459
people are very nice people go I want to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.390
play it you don't know anything about it

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.380
you she'll it's I don't mean to be rude

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.570
but it's bad it's if I got a code for

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.299
Tamil quests in my email had no personal

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.709
connection to it I would make fun of it

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.510
I would be like and you know maybe

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.790
that's reflects poorly on me in the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.650
first place whether it's bad but it's

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.470
possible that you know with a little bit

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.419
of polish I'm I could be convinced

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.580
and in this case it really is just a

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.470
little bit of Polish

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.930
because it's like it's going to make it

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.180
a ten it'll make it like a 1 and that

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.449
that maybe is good enough I might

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.009
release it for free on you know a niche

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.139
geo page or something like that

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.599
we'll see it really would only be

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.849
interesting to play as a as a curiosity

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.449
but yeah that was pretty much like half

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:50.000
of how I spent my vacation there wasn't

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.349
it wasn't intentional it wasn't like I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.479
went into the vacation being like I got

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:57.830
to make a game I just sort of like you

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.690
know on Monday day or yeah it was it was

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.669
Monday on Monday I just sort of got a

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.080
legal pad and some paper and was like

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.569
you know what kind of projects could I

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.849
work on here for a few days just to pass

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.310
the time and then you know I sketched

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.319
out an idea and then I made it work and

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.909
then at the end of like two days it was

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.250
playable and I was like I might as well

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.360
just I'm still here might as well just

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.240
keep trying to make it a little bit

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.710
better so yeah and it was also a great

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.210
reminder that even like the worst games

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.610
you've ever played as long as they

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.690
worked like a lot of a lot of work went

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.310
into them anyway so that's it'll happen

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.349
perhaps at some point you'll see that

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.180
either way it's a milestone for me so

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:39.860
I'm I'm kind of like nerdily like really

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.569
pleased with myself so this is a tough

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.270
situation we're in such a good spot

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.639
regardless but do you take too ality

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.940
followed by Abaddon that's probably like

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.550
position a do you take Abaddon reroll

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.089
duality and then hope to get something

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.289
else in the in the duality slot that's a

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.569
little better even knowing you're going

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.639
to play play black arts or pay black

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.969
cards for it or do you reroll both of

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:08.990
these I think you probably go position a

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:10.879
I don't really like duality that much to

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.659
be honest sin Viktor and I disagree on

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:16.550
many items he told me duality is like a

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.279
ten out of ten I disagree with him he's

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.690
not well I mean he might be wrong but I

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.539
hesitate to say he's wrong because it's

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.690
not like sin Victor's like a two out of

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.219
ten Isaac player you know he's had

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.289
triple digit streaks as well just a

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.270
different playstyles or different things

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.310
you're looking for I suppose but I don't

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.690
see it at all he also told me coupon is

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.979
like a ten out of ten because it helps

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.660
to get free deals with the devil and I'm

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.580
out see you buddy but

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.500
I took his word for it for a while and

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.750
ended up getting burned myself I think

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.250
just just thinking that it was good but

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.680
again different strokes for different

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.120
folks it's possible he over rates those

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.750
as possible ion to rate them it's

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.190
possible

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.750
perhaps that both are happening at the

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.770
same time we are disparate individuals

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:01.280
for their own tastes and preferences as

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.720
we head downwards here I don't feel bad

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.940
about this because you're going to be

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.060
like and now these runs are too easy

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.220
it's like comical how easy they are yeah

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.500
but i'm these are the perfect runs for

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.810
being out of practice like yeah do we

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.640
have an above average rate of fire maybe

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.060
close to triple our usual damage for

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.000
this point of the game and 2020 as well

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.440
effectively doubling not only our rate

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.340
of fire but also the damage we do as

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:32.140
well well that one's mildly Falls that's

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:35.840
that's a spirit of spurious claim

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.450
because I don't think 2020 doubles your

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.010
your rate of fire or damage it's sorted

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.080
does because the shots aren't far away

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.510
but it's probably more like you know 1.8

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.590
or something but if you're talking

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:52.010
integers and not floats then okay sure

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:53.840
although like the if you cast a a float

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.370
as an integer does it get truncated or

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.930
rounded this see that's like a job

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.180
interview question I don't know that one

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:04.340
all I know is the sound it makes when it

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:05.090
takes a man's life okay now I don't want

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.010
power pill

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.570
puberty's fine question marks are

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.280
irrelevant you know what get out of your

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.940
Tower card that's that's our new dumping

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.790
ground in that room so it is pretty much

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.440
impossible for us to lose this run it's

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.030
it's also I know that we've been having

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.230
a lot of Isaac runs have been very fast

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.870
lately

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:27.470
and it's it's not my intention to be

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:29.240
speeding through these the problem

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.220
becomes you know if your run is even

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.200
like mildly glass cannon II you just

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.599
can't fight hush and you know you

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.849
probably don't want to fight delirium

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:39.620
but you have to expect delirium will not

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:41.750
show up anyway except in situations

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.460
where it seems like you definitely

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.170
shouldn't do it there by you know giving

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.330
you the Sophie's Choice of the whole

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.240
situation that was just god-awful damage

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.220
so it's kind of hard not to go fast when

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.490
you're when your stats are ballin like

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.190
this

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.779
that's what I'm trying to say but this

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:01.520
floor definitely you know we got to item

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:06.649
rooms left one shop keep an eye out for

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:10.330
steam sales shorty something one shut up

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:14.600
see it's not a good reference - nas nas

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:18.890
can I tell you something my parents are

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:22.010
and I'm les this be seen I know some

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:24.170
people you know they didn't have great

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.370
up rings or they have other reasons to

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.870
disparage their parents I'm not

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.459
disparaging my parents at all what I am

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.500
though is mining their experience or

00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:34.850
humor and I hope that if they ever saw

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:40.130
this they would feel the same way but my

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:42.920
parents are uniquely just mildly out of

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:45.440
touch technologically in ways that are

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:50.089
hilarious to me let me explain first off

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.040
I had to set up their wireless printer

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:54.589
for them that's I think a fairly common

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.029
story you know what I had to do I had to

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:57.649
enter the Wi-Fi password into the

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:59.390
wireless printer you know no harm no

00:09:57.649 --> 00:10:01.279
foul they can both drive a stick-shift

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.480
than I can but I just thought it was

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.829
funny I was like if you entered your

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.420
wireless password and they're like we

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:08.029
don't know and I was like alright I got

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.279
like a 99% confidence that I can solve

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:12.560
this problem for you so that wasn't that

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:15.290
was nice and it worked out the other

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.290
thing is here's how my parents listened

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.570
to music in the car they have all their

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.270
music loaded like the car has a hard

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:27.500
drive that it can play from for its

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:30.620
stereo what they do is they play the

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.560
music alphabetically starting at letter

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:36.709
A and then just going through the whole

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.630
collection I think I'd rather re-roll

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:42.410
the library again going through the

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:45.130
whole collection based on song name so

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:48.440
you know starts and it's like you know

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.730
Alabama woman Mississippi man and I'm

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.730
just I'm trying to think of songs at all

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:55.160
basically it took like four days for us

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.720
to get from the A's to the B's and then

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.399
the second thing it was like this is a

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.650
rudimentary so at least have a playlist

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:02.300
or you know play by artist or something

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.040
this is you're really going through your

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.250
whole collection letter by letter that's

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.460
like a gargantuan task

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:12.560
but then they and I don't blame them for

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.360
this because you know I don't have a

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.610
music collection I just have Google Play

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.620
I'm limited or whatever which I think

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.260
they should give us for free is YouTube

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.670
partners but I digress anyway so the put

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.140
enough that YouTube Partner means

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:28.220
anything in this day and age I guess but

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.839
anyway the point is my music collection

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.700
might have one was disorganized as well

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:34.880
but they have duplicates so it'll play

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.589
like you know back in the USSR and then

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.750
it'll go into the next track and it'll

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:41.570
be like den nnnn and you're like oh it's

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:44.000
back in the USSR again and then do it

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.800
again it would be like okay so third

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.750
time is back in the USSR and then you'll

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.600
hear dananananana and you're like oh

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.160
this is back in the USSR live so

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:57.410
sometimes it would take like four or

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:59.300
five oh it's got to be real old baby I

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:05.480
love you way but I'm gonna reroll you

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:12.010
anyway is okay yeah that's more like it

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:14.600
um certainly I will take the Steam sale

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.100
but yeah so you'd end up you'd hear a

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.200
song and then you'd hear like the

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.089
opening couple of bars of it many many

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.980
times in a row I thought that was very

00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:24.290
funny I didn't bring it up to them

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.760
because that's a problem that I don't

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.020
want to I don't want them to be aware of

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.600
if they're content with it then that's

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.970
cool I don't want to be involved in the

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.260
solution process for that because it's

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.540
gonna be like oh what do you do oh well

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.339
rip all the music out of your car and

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.990
then what you do is you're gonna like

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.430
you know plug a USB Drive into your

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.190
computer and you're only going to drag

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:46.880
in you know like unique songs not

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:49.610
duplicates and no just one day I will be

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.980
there I'm sort of already there to the

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.620
extent that I only listen to like two

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:57.589
albums and for a while I would do that

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:01.490
like I would go to youtube like YouTube

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:03.470
of Brian Eno's ambien one music for

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:07.250
airports you know I didn't say it out

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:12.410
loud is I'm not a hundred but we got

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:13.820
here but my parents they have crossed I

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.020
realize I'm talking a lot about my

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.360
parents these episodes but I hope that

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.920
it's like you know it's my nipple for

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.750
humor in a way that's inoffensive but

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.460
also

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.530
love lifting in many ways you know a

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.120
good tale of the domestic situation gone

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.340
right is that another puberty you know

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.960
it's reported our energy so good if I

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.350
can find our library again on this curse

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.840
of the lost but there'd amnesia when I

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:37.120
was a kid and a lot of people I'm

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.220
assuming that are around the same age as

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:44.130
me and a little bit older I guess will

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:46.810
be able to relate to this not worth it

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.280
worth it although anything that gets hit

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:53.590
is probably going to die anyway also

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:55.600
worth it anyway we the way you used to

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.940
get movies as you go to a video rental

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.620
store like a blockbuster or a jumbo

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.410
video by the way in my hometown there

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.090
was a there were many blockbusters one

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.410
of them has been rented out and has

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.420
become something else the other one has

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.610
been out of business since like 2008 and

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.890
has not become anything else still just

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.750
a weird old blockbuster with like the

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:17.020
the reels on the windows and stuff like

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:19.840
that but anyway you go to the video

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.220
store how do you how do you know your

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.660
parents are paying the bills so they're

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:26.650
in charge of taking most of the movies

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.600
least this way it worked in my house how

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.880
do they choose what movie to watch I

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.130
don't know about you guys my parents

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.160
would like look at the cover of a movie

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:39.280
and then be like this looks good enough

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.100
to read the back audience peer at our

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.320
what good could it be right and then

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.780
they were to read the back and they'd be

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.210
like this sounds good now you end up

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.610
watching some movies that are actually

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.200
good you know probably that's how we saw

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:56.770
Slingblade or something like that

00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:00.130
fling play is a great film we also ended

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:02.650
up watching like a lot of trash and to

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:05.230
their credit they stuck with that style

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:08.410
for a long time you know even they would

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:13.660
be on Netflix as of a few years ago and

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:14.770
they would be like we're going to like

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.570
just look at the descriptions of things

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:21.730
and see if they're good and it you know

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:23.710
as a hipster effectively I was like you

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.960
should really look at the adjusted metal

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:28.089
score and but anyway you should go to

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.350
Dan G fling comm slash movies and see

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:32.140
what everybody's favorite Big Brother

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:35.480
contestant thought of it

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.730
but no now they obviously going to take

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.910
the luck upgrade even at the cost of the

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:45.680
spear at hard loss but now they look

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:47.030
stuff up on Netflix on their TV because

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.620
they have they have a smart TV which

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.740
I'll admit that I don't even really know

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:55.370
what that means it's a TV with apps I

00:15:51.740 --> 00:16:00.680
guess it's strange to me which means

00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:02.060
that I'm a hundred but anyway they to

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.170
steam sales that's the dream right there

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.080
now we really want to go to the hush

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.880
fight they find something that looks

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.230
good on Netflix and then they look it up

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:14.690
on Rotten Tomatoes which I know not

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.610
everybody man we got all the damage

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.960
multipliers and they're all I mean after

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.340
the first one they're not that good I

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.200
understand people have a problem with

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.610
Rotten Tomatoes trust me I understand

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.770
that it's not you know if something gets

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.350
100% it's the greatest movie ever made

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.930
it just means it's very likeable at at a

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.430
minimum but it's way better than just

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.890
like looking at the box and being like

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.470
you know all this movies got Danny

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:38.720
DeVito winner die like that guy now how

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.090
the heck did we end up watching Seth

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.490
MacFarlane's a million ways to die in

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.170
the West with this methodology I don't

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:50.630
know it's got like a 33 percent on

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:52.130
Rotten Tomatoes but I digress that's

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.220
that's a story for another day

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:57.490
so they have they're using the tools at

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.490
their disposal

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:03.310
I don't have anything really more to say

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.680
you know what's funny is that you might

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.300
think that I have like so got the adult

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.160
transformation you might think that I

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.980
have like some sense of superiority but

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:15.130
I really don't because I had to print

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.860
something out so you know if for two

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.570
days I felt superior like oh I'm still

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.700
hip and with technology I know how to

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:25.720
install a wireless printer by putting in

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.950
the Wi-Fi password like three days later

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.780
I was like hey mom can I use your

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:32.830
printer she was like yeah no problem

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.360
which makes sense because I mean what

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:38.260
did I use like you know 20 cents where

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.870
the ink but anyway the point is takes

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:44.830
takes all kinds you know we all got

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:46.780
something to offer here I'll admit I'm a

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.400
little out of touch technologically

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:53.290
speaking I think I'm a little out of

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:56.370
touch technologically speaking mostly

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:59.170
because I'm on like a Canadian data plan

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.550
we don't get unlimited data up here

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.500
although it's starting to relax a little

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.000
bit which is nice it's not because we

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.920
live in the frozen north it's because

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.420
you know we have like a

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:11.550
Telecommunications Oleg ah Polly that

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:15.910
you know keeps us keeps the man you know

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:18.280
fingers around our throats here but so I

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.900
I don't I guess the thing that's most

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.780
related to my industry that I don't

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.790
understand is I RL streaming that is

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.620
something where I'm like I don't quite

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.860
become the people who are like why would

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:32.110
anybody watch anybody play video games

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.720
you know I don't get to that level I'm

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:37.510
more on the other side of I'm like he's

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.480
yellow streamers like you got to take

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.440
some time to not be on camera and I'm

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.090
not telling you how to run your business

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.250
because you know your audience way

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.780
better than I do but at the same time

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.690
when people are like hey we're doing an

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.730
IRL stream it's me eating dinner at this

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:56.350
you know Mexican restaurant out in town

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:59.410
I'm like that scares me dude how long

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:02.890
until like you live your whole life in

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:05.020
the public eye like I like the division

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.630
of labor that we've got going on here I

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.860
make videos I try to be entertaining in

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.860
the videos and I do the streams of

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.880
course and

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.400
strength code we're not going to need

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.200
that well we've really been more than

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:22.260
hoggle ah use your brain for two seconds

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:24.660
here okay and I try to be entertaining

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.520
and then the video goes up and you know

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:31.049
you either like it or you don't like it

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:33.210
but you know that's that and then I you

00:19:31.049 --> 00:19:35.100
know at some point usually like a little

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.020
later than my wife would like stop

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.600
working for the day and I go you know

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.670
take care of my household chores without

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.200
a camera being on me without you know

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.080
being forced to be funny and stuff like

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.370
that or to try to be funny at least and

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.710
I like that I admire the ability to

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:55.500
admire is not the right word I cherish

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:59.100
the ability to sometimes be away from

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.360
the prying eyes of the internet even if

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:05.240
it is a futile endeavor

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:08.360
it's our third Steam sale so I mean I

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:11.730
feel like we should try to re-roll it

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:15.120
well see if that comes to fruition but

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:17.669
like when people IRL stream like not not

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.390
everybody IRL streams like their whole

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:20.970
life

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.380
some people they you know if you die RL

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.299
stream like I hate saying that

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.620
expression over and over but if you IRL

00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:27.630
stream like eight hours then you got

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.299
eight hours off that's different but you

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.590
know when you like okay I'm going out

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:33.240
with my friend that you dinner and then

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.950
you stream it oh my god are you really

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.660
eating dinner with your friend or are

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.070
you like making a product at that point

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.840
and how does that make you feel I'm not

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.250
saying you're like exploiting anybody

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.080
I'm just I'm saying at the end of the

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.730
day like don't you feel like you're

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.220
trapped in some kind of like content

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.559
prison of your own creation and do you

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:53.130
feel like you have to do it because of

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:55.200
the because you know that's that's the

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.790
way to pay the bills or you like you

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.980
want to do it like you want to live your

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.320
whole life to this degree of you know

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.360
the lack of any kind of anonymity I

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.850
guess is what I'm trying to say we're

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.910
getting into some this is like highly

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:10.820
inside baseball at this point but that's

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:14.280
that's where I'm out of touch I think

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:16.890
that in like to some extent I don't

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.290
understand Instagram and I think that

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:21.460
the if you're a little younger than me a

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:24.010
little too a lot younger than me

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.120
as younger of me as you can be you

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.059
probably are just lay this is like a

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.370
photo sharing app but like I it's not

00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:33.850
just a photo sharing app right like

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:36.429
there's a culture like you can get like

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:39.760
a lot of followers on Instagram just for

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:41.200
having a nice but is my experience it's

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.450
not like that's not the case on YouTube

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.990
I mean like lord knows I slept my way to

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:51.669
the top at the top of the middle please

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:53.529
but no like it's just it's not that I

00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:55.529
don't get it because I mean I get it you

00:21:53.529 --> 00:21:58.029
know butts have been a driving force in

00:21:55.529 --> 00:22:01.149
popularity for millions and millions of

00:21:58.029 --> 00:22:03.820
years but it seems like there's a lot of

00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:06.970
like but related content coming from

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.950
Instagram maybe that's just maybe that's

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.020
ignorant of me maybe that's all I see is

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:13.570
the but related content maybe that says

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.309
something for me it says something about

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:20.500
me rather I mean there's some there's

00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:23.110
some choices here we didn't take the

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:26.289
halo of life so I think we should not

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.730
take sorry we didn't take the attack fly

00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:29.350
so I think we should not take halo flies

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.779
because Beelzebub is less likely to show

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:34.090
up as a result anyway here so instead I

00:22:31.779 --> 00:22:35.409
took dark bomb and I mean we probably

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.470
would have been safe to take dark bomb

00:22:35.409 --> 00:22:40.419
anyway but it is also still very good

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.100
and we found a use for strength here in

00:22:40.419 --> 00:22:46.000
giving us a little bit of a leg up on

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:49.510
the competition like I don't really I'm

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.320
just saying I don't get Instagram that

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:55.630
that's about it

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:57.720
I sort of get it well I don't know I

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.890
sort of like don't get Facebook anymore

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:03.730
Facebook if you're if you're a little on

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:06.549
the younger side and I had to preface a

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.649
lot of my conversations with that over

00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:11.980
the course of this episode but you know

00:23:08.649 --> 00:23:13.809
I was a I was a freshman in college when

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:18.340
Facebook opened its doors to people that

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:20.289
didn't just have a edu email addresses

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.390
so Facebook was still like new and fresh

00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:24.730
you'd like you be at a party and you'd

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.779
meet somebody and you would be like I'm

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.370
going to add you on facebook and then

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:29.169
you add them and you'd be like oh my god

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.309
I know way too much about this person

00:23:29.169 --> 00:23:32.500
this is awesome

00:23:30.309 --> 00:23:34.300
and we're sharing photos and like you're

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.000
clicking the like button while I was

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:41.080
five for the you know the creation of

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.150
the like button as well the point is

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.740
like at that point it was like this is

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.170
awesome it was like exactly the right

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:50.590
age to for Facebook to be popping off

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:54.250
and now I only see two kinds of posts on

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.450
my facebook the one kind of post is

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.970
political and I'm sure you're all

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.790
experiencing those even whether you live

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:04.180
in the US or overseas I promise you

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:06.940
you're seeing them the other one is my

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.220
friends and and spouses of friends who

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:12.010
have had babies just post like a lot of

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:14.980
mommy stuff like and I'm not saying in

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:17.650
like the fetish sort of way you sickos

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:20.020
rather you just like you won't believe

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:22.330
this you know life hack that turns your

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.310
crib into a full service diaper changing

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:29.400
station and I'm like there is like some

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:32.020
there's a mafia like El Cosa Nostra on

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:35.140
Facebook of moms sharing tips and that's

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:39.400
cool people disparage that and I'm

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:42.580
disparaging it because like you know I

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.380
don't want to see that but I can choose

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.940
not to see that you know if you're

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.800
posting pictures of your kids I can be

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.280
like you know unfollow or whatever it

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.840
doesn't matter

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.360
I think it's cool it like you know if

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.860
you're if you're a young mom you know

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.570
maybe you're like well you if you're my

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.730
age you're like twenty eight not all

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.260
your friends have babies at this point

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.460
and you got to spend a lot of time with

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.700
your baby that's something a babies

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:06.160
they're a selfish they're an exit to

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:09.490
this other still this guy there's a lot

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.710
of a lot of time that goes into having a

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.780
baby you spend time at home you're

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.690
isolated you want to cultivate a social

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.040
network even if it's only digitally

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.420
that's what I think that that's not so

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.620
bad

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.610
you know when people post the pictures

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:26.080
of themselves or they like their

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.270
parenting tips or something like that

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.160
doesn't bother me that much when I was

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:32.410
like 23 I was a little smarmy about it

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.320
you know how to why did we pick up moms

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:38.080
I your idiot

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:40.150
I don't want to see this people in my

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.010
life that I used to be acquaintances

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.630
with our having children and I sir I

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.200
didn't sign up to this website to see

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.480
children

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.950
it's an enormous inconvenience so later

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.600
my filet mignons Cole

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:55.179
you know like it's not that big of a

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:57.789
deal but at the time I was maybe like a

00:25:55.179 --> 00:26:00.130
little will smarmy about it great name

00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:08.590
for us an out-of-touch rapper as well

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:11.980
we'll smarmy the chicken or fish oil has

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:14.500
elapsed to please what is that voice and

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.110
can I do it again ahead to that you

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.029
please that's not quite the same there

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.500
is a unique sort of like Kermit the Frog

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:22.690
--is-- nips in your voice the first time

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.450
that I'd like to return to it possible

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:28.059
so with moms I apparently we're shooting

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:32.679
behind us every single time so we got to

00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:34.539
be very cautious about this but Facebook

00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:37.029
basically sucks now I don't know maybe

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:40.090
it's like Facebook sucks when you're

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:43.600
over the age of like 22 but it was kind

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:45.690
of getting there for sure because here's

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.269
like the evolution of my facebook

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:51.250
network everybody at this point either

00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:53.649
post mom stuff political stuff or they

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:57.309
stop posting but if you started like age

00:26:53.649 --> 00:26:59.169
18 it was like making events going cool

00:26:57.309 --> 00:27:00.460
photo posted on people's walls hey what

00:26:59.169 --> 00:27:02.019
are you doing tonight you know come over

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.090
to the quad I don't think my school had

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:09.490
a quad but anyway you get the idea

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:11.679
then by like 20 it was like graduation

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.299
like by the way I got a job offer and

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:14.620
Ornstein yelling and nearly okay so

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:17.110
that's cool like I want to know what you

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:21.399
guys are up to then it like 22 it was

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:25.720
like just photos of people like in

00:27:21.399 --> 00:27:28.630
volleyball if--and you're like well this

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:32.169
is just becoming braggadocious I haven't

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:34.389
spoken to you in you know six years and

00:27:32.169 --> 00:27:35.830
now there's all these photos of you just

00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:37.809
like hanging out on the beach or

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.490
something like I'm not disparaging your

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:40.630
ability to hang out on the beach I'm

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:44.110
just saying like I'm not sure I need to

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:45.370
see these and then it's like I met the

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:48.630
most beautiful man in the world you know

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:52.750
y'all have sweet and then it's like

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:54.519
mommy stuff or political stuff if you've

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:56.980
made the decision to not have children

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:58.389
maybe that's I'm not going to risk going

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.370
back to that if you got something for me

00:27:58.389 --> 00:28:01.660
let me know if you've made the decision

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.220
and not have children your poster

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.750
political stuff if you're posting at all

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.610
if you've made the decision to have

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.090
children you're posting mommy stuff if

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:12.430
you're posting anything at all that's a

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:18.670
little spooky there that's my my

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:20.080
facebook experience in 2017 so I think

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.840
we should take this and then hopefully

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.970
get something amazing for free which is

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:33.520
exactly what flipping happened there so

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:36.400
like that's pretty dope twitter is

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:39.100
definitely like what are we on run utero

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.360
one so we could fight mega Satan I kind

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:43.030
of want to reroll this into something

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.390
cool but I'll give myself the chance at

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:47.230
least to fight mega Satan we definitely

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.600
want to go fight hush because

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:54.940
everything's free if we can have the HP

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:56.620
necessary to swing it at least Twitter

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.290
is the social network for me because

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:04.540
it's like a nihilist social network

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:06.460
where everything you post is it's not so

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:08.740
bad actually everything you post is a

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.360
satirical sort of thing and also the

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.540
subtext is like we're all going to die

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.490
someday it's like the most Hegelian

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.980
social network out there which which

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.710
appeals to me I hate to do this but I

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.120
basically have to sit here and play this

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:23.800
slot machine to get enough HP to survive

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.060
the hush fight holy Mantle's going to

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.340
help out a great deal but we're probably

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.140
going to take a hit from our imp attack

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.310
on every single room so the real goal is

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:40.140
to just get through it like as quickly

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:40.140
as possible I mean that's about it

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.120
don't have anything more to say about

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.520
the situation than that I mean like is

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.350
there a more a more tired sort of

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:54.170
conversation at this point in time than

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:57.580
hey BAE Facebook is bad but you know we

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.580
are Facebook dude we did it to ourselves

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:05.360
I kind of wanted to handle this in a

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.820
slightly different way but basically I

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.980
wanted to use the sun cards that had

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:12.860
made it possible for me to see the map

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:15.110
but also go check out you know possibly

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.220
kill a room at the same time so it was

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:20.210
unfortunately just ended up fighting

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:23.450
enemies that don't die that easily the

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.920
problem with Facebook is that you know

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.990
if you want to have an honest Facebook

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:30.710
experience there's only like two options

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:32.900
if you only post the good stuff you're

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.640
bragging you know I'm guilty of Facebook

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:38.240
bragging good editing my younger days

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:41.270
for sure you know definitely when I went

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.370
to Iceland took a picture of my like

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.170
media name tag and looks like just have

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.090
a couple days in Iceland you know like

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:49.190
it's no big deal inside I was like this

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.900
is the biggest deal but if you only post

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.940
the good stuff you're bragging and the

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.030
only purpose of bragging is not to keep

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.410
people posted it's to make other people

00:30:55.030 --> 00:31:01.280
envious of you which is a very base

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:03.710
level bad look but if you post

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.500
everything it's too much information you

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.600
know if you if you put the good stuff up

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.110
there the mundane stuff which is 99

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.400
percent of it and then the good stuff as

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.900
well the good stuff the bad stuff in the

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.150
mundane stuff you're going to be posting

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.680
non-stop having a turkey salad sandwich

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:22.820
today and then nobody wants to see that

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:24.200
I guess the other uses you could put

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.230
like song lyrics up there or something

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.030
but yeah you'll get over that I promise

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:31.910
ok so we should try to make the hush

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:33.410
fight I just realized that's fine that's

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.600
fine just realize that spent a lot of

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:37.100
time in here so let's go try to make

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.510
that happen we got the damage necessary

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.510
to make it happen so that's ok

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:51.520
definitely like if you got met people in

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.370
college that were like I don't have a

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.140
Facebook and you're like wow weird why

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.900
would you not have a Facebook it's like

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.210
a social necessity to have a Facebook

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.920
not not like you're being a social

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.900
butterfly necessarily but just like

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:08.350
that's how people get in touch and like

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:11.710
have events and stuff like that it's

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:13.660
important it did sort of was at the time

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:15.820
as weird as that sounds in hindsight but

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.010
now you know people are like I don't

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.130
have a Facebook I'm like you are let's

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.660
hang out like can you give me your

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.130
telephone numbers so we can have some

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:28.810
conversations because it seems like you

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:31.690
got your head screwed on straight you

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.950
mean you don't have to tell people you

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.790
haven't seen in 12 years that you're

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:38.590
going to Cabo San Lucas for a weekend I

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:40.390
didn't know that that was in the in the

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:47.380
social contract that you could just opt

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:51.550
out of that you mean you don't have to

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:54.430
share a post of a wine bottle sized wine

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:56.920
glass with the hashtag mom Eagles just

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:58.270
because you signed on 9gag I thought

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:06.700
that was like written into the

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:07.900
Constitution so I not a huge fan of this

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.420
fight at this point but we made it

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:15.130
happen and we like totally made it

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:17.290
happen because we also managed to get

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.990
the oh the doors going to be closed

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.250
isn't it still we made a sacrifice for

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.800
what I would consider to be like a

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:26.290
mildly okay cause we got our deal with

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.730
the devil or we got our deal with the

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:31.180
angel I should say yeah that's a bummer

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:33.480
I mean that's I missed it by six seconds

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:36.340
you mean I miss my major by a couple of

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.650
seconds so I'm in the shop class or the

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.170
basket weaving with all the rest of them

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:43.860
MF errs underachieving mother fathers

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.860
underachieving

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.950
I was thinking too cuz you know while I

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:56.690
was away I did I went back to my high

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:58.430
school I have to say to present this

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:00.080
award and it might seem like I'm

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.880
bragging but really it's just because

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.100
I'm a 28 year old man and if I just say

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.070
I went back to my high school you'd be

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.990
like this guy's freaking creep right no

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.880
I just I went back to my high school to

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:13.700
present that award and thinking like

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.220
what's it like to be graduating from

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:18.950
high school in 2017 I graduated from

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:21.200
high school in 2006 so it's a big

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:22.550
difference you know if you if you're

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.700
graduating this year I graduated when

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:29.330
you were like eight not if we're not

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:32.480
super far off here now so I'm trying to

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:35.780
keep myself you know relevant but you

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.220
know they say like what the what the

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.470
people are doing when they graduate this

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:41.810
is just one sample size first off you

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:44.090
know there's 17 to 18 so who knows right

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.680
you know they could be saying one thing

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.320
and then in three years their life will

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.750
be in a totally different situation

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.670
which is completely fine there's so many

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.770
people they're like you know so-and-so

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:56.840
graduated they got the award in this and

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:59.030
then they're coming back to the height

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.320
it's our fourth Steam sale we didn't

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.090
pick up our third one technically

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:06.560
they're coming back to the high school

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:07.730
next year this person you know you need

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.170
a little bit more history which is

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:13.400
probably going to be not the most

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:15.020
exciting thing but basically school runs

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:19.640
from kindergarten until the 12th grade

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:22.250
in Ontario but I used to run until like

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.380
2002 it ran from kindergarten until the

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:28.100
13th grade so you were one year older

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:30.740
when you graduated from high school so

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.330
many students around that age Joseph II

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.740
was known as a victory lap where you

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.680
returned for a fifth year of high school

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.790
you know shore up your marks I'm going

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.960
to be honest with you it's basically a

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:43.670
good opportunity to have a part-time job

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.990
take whatever classes you wanted to take

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.040
that you couldn't fit in or classes you

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.390
want to shore up your average a little

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:52.910
bit before applying to post-secondary

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:55.190
school or jobs etc etc probably like 15%

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:57.170
of my graduating class did that and I'm

00:35:55.190 --> 00:36:00.350
actually asking from a place of like if

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:00.980
you're in this age group what am i off

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.520
base here

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:06.680
with the numbers at least it seemed like

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:09.290
50% roughly that is a pretty rough

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:11.270
approximation we're like I'm going to

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:13.610
take an extra year of high school before

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:17.690
I choose what to do and on the one hand

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:20.360
I'm like that's good because you're 17

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.440
18 to expect you to have an idea of what

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:27.110
you want to do for the rest of your life

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:29.960
is not plausible for everybody guess

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:32.390
we're just going to fight I do like the

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:37.730
leprosy item dry babies wonderful you

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:39.890
know what this is a horrible idea but I

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:42.110
kind of want to try it will you will you

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:44.150
allow me to try this here see the thing

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.040
with sprinkler is that it's gonna you

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:50.830
know shoot epic Akshata that I'm going

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:52.850
to have to dodge weird not I want those

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:54.080
we might be able to make something

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.430
happen with that health upgrade pill

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.440
again I'm going to try it with the

00:36:55.430 --> 00:37:01.220
knowledge deep in my heart that I could

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.550
easily die here but gonna put it up

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.930
there and see see how it goes

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:09.940
just get ready to try to dodge some

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:09.940
shots from time to time ah

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:16.790
um oh yeah anyway the point is it's like

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.920
unreasonable to expect an 18 year old to

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:21.050
know what they're going to do with their

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.310
lives it's just it's a ridiculous

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:25.550
premise you do have to choose at some

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:28.010
point but you know it's pretty young but

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:29.480
on the other hand I was like you've got

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.490
to get out of here

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.140
you're just not like you're delaying

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.460
your career for another year and I'm

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.900
sure like when you leave them high

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.220
school many people not everybody

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.930
obviously when many people are going to

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.710
have like good memories of it dude the

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:44.510
mom's eye sprinkler is so funny looking

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:45.830
but I was like you guys got it got to

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:47.630
get out and experience the world I guess

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.490
you don't have to do it right now

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:51.710
you could wait until you know you're

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:54.530
legally able to like sign a document but

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:57.650
I was kind of surprised because when I

00:37:54.530 --> 00:38:02.030
graduated almost everybody was like I'm

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:04.760
out like I got to go to the big city man

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.770
and by big city I mean you know a city

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:10.700
that's slightly bigger like Ottawa or

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:11.870
something like that I was just surprised

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.250
that you know I'm not sure if it's a

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.140
generational thing or a one-off

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.000
statistic

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:19.059
you know variance sort of situation or

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.369
what but seems like least the kids at my

00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:23.619
old high school are definitely way more

00:38:21.369 --> 00:38:24.720
open to just kind of hanging out for

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:27.220
another year

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.660
anyway it's irrelevant in the end thanks
