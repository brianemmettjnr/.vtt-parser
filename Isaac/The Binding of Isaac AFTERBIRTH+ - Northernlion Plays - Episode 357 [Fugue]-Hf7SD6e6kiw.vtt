00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.560
you that okay now we don't have an is a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.130
zone we can stop taking on airs here and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.050
z18 P 2 X G X jeez it's quite obvious

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.970
to you first things going to drop and

then he's going to what and then I don't

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.019
remember most of the rest of it please

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.090
tell me you accidentally blow yourself

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.380
up okay sweet thanks for this this is a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.719
great first room to experience on the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.719
bright side in one of the chests we

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.309
almost accidentally killed the enemy

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.010
that's going to take us 20 years to get

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.289
around here okay

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.000
he's inside of the wall so we can't be

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.170
hit we're going to spend like our first

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.329
two minutes doing this hey take this guy

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.710
out of the game at least take champion

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.719
that guy out of the game because we're

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000
getting to the point that's some real

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.770
nasty first room I don't mind coming

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.490
across those guys you know after floor

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.830
one but on floor one that's like pretty

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.630
ridiculous bad stroke of luck but I want

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.970
to avoid falling into that a habit of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.680
being like I played so much of this game

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.150
anything that's mildly difficult and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.630
takes me out of my comfort zone I hate

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.850
it remember it was like when we first

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
started playing nice we had no idea what

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.130
did what we were all so young back then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.939
we were so young that that song we are

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.040
young by that band fun was young now

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.540
it's a classic people tweeting me stop

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.479
talking about that song it reminds me of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.399
when I was in second grade yo that's not

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.890
you know slow down you're moving too

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.649
fast hear that song as an American Eagle

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.030
classic I don't understand clothing

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.790
stores and music I don't understand

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
music in general ok that's obviously a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.310
ridiculous statement give me a moment

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.030
here to kill these guys I don't want to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.460
talk about it because I don't like going

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.619
to restaurants and there's just music

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.129
playing over like a speaker system I

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.490
don't understand it I think we've been

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.260
cultivated to believe that it

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.450
like a more pleasant environment if you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.340
go to like a really classy place and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.860
there's someone like you know playing a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.390
piano or something I like that you know

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.620
especially you know around Christmas

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.330
done have yourself a merry little

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.180
Christmas you're like this is a nice

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.950
atmosphere I feel like I'm in like a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.770
harold ramos movie or something like

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.910
that we definitely want to do it like

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.220
this and we definitely want to take that

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.750
as well we're kind of in a tight spot

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.010
here but for the most part I don't

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.570
really like go into a restaurant there

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.310
being music playing because the old

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.290
there's only two options it's the right

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.610
volume but there's still music or it's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.470
too loud and we have to yell at the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.910
restaurant and that happens to a degree

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.730
that I find annoying

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.100
maybe I'm just a hundred years old but

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.570
there's a particular change of

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.090
restaurants in Vancouver that shall

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.130
remain nameless that are the absolute

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.820
can I say the f-word on here there's a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.840
freakin worst for this and it always

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.990
annoys me I guess I'm just going to die

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.700
then it's been fun guys this is not a

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.780
100% of games fault if we go down here

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.180
because we could have lived if we just

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.000
didn't go to the curse room or if the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.350
curse room at any HP in it or if we

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:44.900
found a tinted rock on the floor we're

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:49.040
at the mercy of these dips dude keep

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.750
keep yourself free of dips we live this

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.440
in this household we're free of dips

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.970
he's done it stay back stay back they

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.950
got low HP we got a chance we got a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.600
chance he's done it he got HP we're back

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.880
in the saddle again that sucked though

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.140
like that that sucked like a lot anyway

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.480
we're down as a next floor is still

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.730
alive

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.489
not saying we shouldn't have done better

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.109
on that floor that boss fight you know

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.730
that can be rough but that floor we

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.620
could have done a lot better on oh I'll

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.930
give you that there's no rest for the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.910
freakin wicked here every single room is

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.700
an another fresh nightmare from the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.979
depths of Edmund MacDonald's mind you

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.650
know Edward McDonald the creator of The

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.850
Binding of Alfred you're playing right

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.229
now it's the game are playing right now

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.990
you ding-dong I don't know what this

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.960
character is calls people ding-dongs and

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.520
hates music that's not true I like music

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.490
I just don't understand how it became

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.410
like a hundred percent sensible and

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.840
common for music to be played in a

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.360
restaurant in a bar I sort of understand

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.690
you're trying to cultivate an atmosphere

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.250
and you know 90% of human interaction is

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:07.970
nonverbal or something like that anyway

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.990
the point is I kind of like lemon mishap

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.720
too but we'll probably just stick with

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.580
the extra chance for money here by our

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.430
combination petrified poop and regular

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:24.610
poop there is a tinted rock in that room

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.750
I find myself eagerly anticipating

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.729
eventually maybe getting a single bomb

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.200
and taking advantage of that yeah I'll

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.810
give it a shot he has done it okay

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.800
thankfully and we're actually probably

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.020
going to get the 15 cents as well so

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.260
handily like this we got a bomb out of

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.919
it again anyway 15 cents is even more of

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.870
a likelihood now I keep trying to go

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.050
back to that

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.430
the bit you know is there anything more

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.010
to say about music and restaurants I

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.620
don't think so I think it's played out

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.669
so I'm going to play myself out here I

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.030
think we can go to that curse room for

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.340
free

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.870
that would be like vindication for the

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.880
last curse room being garbage and I

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.650
don't really want to pay to go to the

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.000
curse room excuse me

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:22.300
we got tagged I'm a little upset I'm not

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.610
going to lie I think we go like this

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.540
the reasoning is actually fairly simple

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.370
in my world wow they can't be the secret

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.110
room disregard you know what I'm gonna

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:40.910
I'm gonna I'm going to be an idiot let's

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:42.740
try it okay so here's how you do this

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.240
first off you definitely don't get hit

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.240
because now getting hit has actually

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.639
ruined my plan what I was going to do is

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.169
take Duffy's head and then we'd have

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.880
half a spirit hour then we take the pack

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.800
we go with the two spirit outs now we

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.010
cannot do that what we can do is take

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.479
the pact lose the spirit heart and then

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.240
go down to one and a half spirit hearts

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:05.270
but I am NOT a happy camper

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.720
that's the result of my Alan idiocy and

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.400
I will let a stream of expletives into

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.440
the air later because guppies head is

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.880
better than petrified poop I don't know

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.680
if I'm being controversial by saying

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.950
that I know people always go NL such an

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.510
edgy youtuber not afraid to make enemies

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.789
doesn't toe the line he says to the line

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:27.380
hey line go after yourself

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:29.330
I prefer curves and then you know hells

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.710
bells plays in the background a yes

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.120
bears my favorite kind of comedian

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:39.320
comedian who's not afraid to say what's

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:45.200
on his mind hey is anybody else an awful

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.970
person okay anyway oh you've done it

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.550
again you've taken away my ability to

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.870
get guppies head I'm a little rusty for

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.150
whatever reason right now we've taken

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.940
damage we shouldn't be taking and our

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.700
DPS and other you know relevant clusters

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.590
of staffs here are strong enough that we

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.900
really shouldn't be putting ourselves in

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.640
this position but apparently

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.560
done nothing to dissuade the game from

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:10.690
the notion that that's going to happen

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:12.460
here so sadly we will still not be able

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.130
to take up he said but I mean we got

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.480
deal with the devil president we should

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.540
have shot the fires and then we shot

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.350
them all after that that's fine

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.060
we still have deal with the devil

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.430
precedent and we flick out a decent set

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.270
up it's not like we screwed the entire

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:30.070
run up smaller Ock would be okay here I

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.290
don't know if that's okay but I went for

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.170
it regardless and I guess in the end it

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:38.890
did give us a key back the only way we

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:40.270
win here is if we use this to also get

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.060
out of a situation in which we'd like to

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:46.270
teleport out but anyway I just think in

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:49.000
general here's what gets me because I

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.410
think everybody not everybody is going

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.430
to agree with no music in a restaurant

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.830
but I think some people will don't some

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.980
people won't but everybody agrees that

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:59.800
if you listen to music on like a subway

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:03.580
or a train or a bus loudly through like

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.780
your phone speaker that's not okay but I

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.200
kind of think that they're the same

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:11.170
thing except one is that there's this

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.240
guy you know if he's just a random

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.560
stranger playing the music you go what

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.720
does he know I don't like his musical

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.460
tastes and then the other one is oh but

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.020
this is the restaurant manager he's the

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.030
arbiter of the music and he gets to

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:25.210
choose you know it's a lot of it's

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.680
acting like you belong that's that's

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.990
given this restaurant manager the

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.310
ability to be a tastemaker instead of

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.740
just a taste server

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.760
I guess managers aren't really service

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.680
you get the guy I don't know anything

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.990
about the restaurant industry is Arby's

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.560
a restaurant what do we have in here car

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:44.890
battery I'll take I wonder I don't I got

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.580
to try something I think if we're moving

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:50.200
quickly maybe we could place two poops

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:54.070
at once doesn't seem like it

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.480
oh well car battery is not worth

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.660
anything for us but man imagine if we

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:03.610
had Guppies head would it imagine how

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:07.210
amazing that would be if I ever get two

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:09.130
pennies out of one of these I will not a

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.630
nickel two pennies then I'll start to

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.760
think that maybe car battery was worth

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.340
it in the end but for now I'm not in

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.699
that position so this is kind of a tough

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.189
call

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:21.069
I'd say you look at this and you go you

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:22.749
know which one do you want to keep the

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:27.059
answer is you want to keep both but

00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:30.759
obviously we can't actually do that so

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:33.369
it's got to be a little careful I just

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:35.139
thought I feel like there are places in

00:10:33.369 --> 00:10:36.869
which music is acceptable to be played

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:38.889
and there's places in which is not and

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:40.959
restaurants are a place where it is

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:42.699
acceptable to play music but I wish that

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:45.189
it weren't you know I'm not going to I'm

00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:46.899
not saying we should seize the means of

00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:48.189
production boycott restaurants until

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:51.669
they take their music off I'm just

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:53.769
saying for whatever reason it doesn't I

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:56.079
don't understand put music on in the

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:58.809
dentist's office right now my dentist

00:10:56.079 --> 00:11:00.819
does not have music on he has a TV in

00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:01.809
his ceiling but it always plays and I

00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:03.459
don't want to tell him this because

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:04.959
again I'm mostly concerned that he's

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:09.040
paying attention to doing the whole

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:12.339
tooth thing right but it always plays

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.529
like the same footage of American

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:17.679
national parks and it's beautiful you

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:19.299
know I don't know why American national

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:20.829
parks I imagine there was like a dental

00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:22.899
magazine that was like hey if you buy

00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:24.519
you know three of these DVDs we'll throw

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:26.679
one in for free and he's just been he's

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:29.049
like I can use that for 25 years worth

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:31.299
of patient entertainment so I've been

00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:34.029
watching those well I you know have

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:35.889
routine checkups and it's fine it's

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:37.899
relatively relaxing but I wish you would

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:39.339
get like some you know put some Seinfeld

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:40.899
up there or something with the subtitles

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:42.850
on I guess he doesn't want you to laugh

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:44.350
so hard that you you know your own teeth

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.989
come out of your nose which is what that

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.059
show does to you but I'm not insulting

00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:50.829
Seinfeld I like Seinfeld I'm just I'm

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:56.559
having a laugh at its expense for

00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:58.329
whatever reason almost and is just so we

00:11:56.559 --> 00:12:01.419
don't care at all about an arcade so I

00:11:58.329 --> 00:12:02.980
guess we should try for a for something

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:04.689
from our shop here although I think

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:09.249
there's a spirit hard and nothing else

00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:10.660
we had a reroll machine though whatever

00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:12.429
well you know it's like what grab one of

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.600
these chariot now that's what I'm

00:12:12.429 --> 00:12:17.559
talking about we can actually use that

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.029
to make a good arcade business happen

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:20.799
here

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:23.759
hopefully maybe we can get like an

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:23.759
internal heart rate here

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.070
much better than an eternal heart we

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.150
can't fight the angel statue I don't

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.740
think that angel statue she gives you a

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:37.240
key piece anyway though now that I think

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:38.890
about it but I think my well my dentist

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.960
does not understand this is like a

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.690
caricature of an NL SS episode right now

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.360
era of an isaac episode I should say

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:50.050
here's my impression of me ordering an

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.850
ice cream cone at the beach but now now

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.280
I think what he wants is that you're

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.540
going to look at the national parks of

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.270
the United States and you're going to be

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.600
like wow Yellowstone National Park it's

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:03.820
beautiful I always have to tell myself

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.440
not to say Jellystone National Park oh

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:11.620
god we have marked Jellystone National

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:13.840
marked but instead what I find myself

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.000
doing is looking at the TV and being

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.830
like who installed this ceiling TV

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.290
because the tiles are they look like

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.810
they're made of like you know corrugated

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:25.330
cardboard up there so I worry that this

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.980
TV is going to fall on me well I'm

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.330
having dental work done and it's only

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.070
out of respect for you that I don't make

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:35.020
an you know Eric Prydz reference this

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:36.490
time he saw me but anyway and then when

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.870
you were significant follow me you could

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.490
just startle the dentist and then who

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.500
knows you know one second he's drilling

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.000
a tooth the next one you know you can

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.260
check out at any time but you can never

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.910
leave if you know what I mean

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:53.580
Hotel California starts playing you get

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.580
the idea so I hate that we have marks

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:02.320
mostly because it sucks and it's bad and

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:05.050
we also love it we got some HP out of it

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.060
and we got stats I don't know where the

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.950
stats came from like Libra plus

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.480
something that already had given us

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.540
disproportionate stats in a different

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.950
area I guess but it's going to make it

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.570
harder to get more damage in the future

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.240
because of Libra and we don't have an

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.920
orbital anymore the ball of bandages is

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.210
kind of like a nice insulator to have

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.950
when you have libras so that you'll

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.830
always be able to run into an enemy and

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.840
hit them marked is a tears upgrade so

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.700
there's a benefit there but there's also

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.880
a lot of negatives because it sucks and

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.710
I hate it so and if you're a well that's

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.200
not a very well reasoned approach to

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:40.720
discourse Northern Line yo I have like

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.140
4,000 hours in this franchise okay I've

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:47.530
given not every item but almost every

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:50.380
item Under the Sun a fair shake at this

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.090
point I have earned the right to say

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.430
this item sucks and I hate it and have

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.650
that be if not an opinion you agree with

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:59.710
at least an opinion with some evidence

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:01.150
of validity behind it I think at least

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.530
human you may disagree and again that's

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.540
your right as well if you've watched me

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.430
play this for 4,000 frickin hours we've

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.020
got a mutual arrangement here it's like

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.660
a Stockholm Syndrome where the kidnapper

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:16.660
gets kidnapped by the kidnapper by the

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:19.720
kidnappee that's what I made to say but

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.370
either way it's just it's like the

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.290
opposite of set it and forget it it's

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.820
like set it and constantly check on it

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:29.200
it's like having a child that is an

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:32.620
isaac item first 18 years of having

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.240
marked you got to be like hey don't eat

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.830
poison and then eventually it's like

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.060
thanks for helping me naughty poison now

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:44.140
I'm going to move out well moving out in

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:49.390
today's day and age and then if that's

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:54.970
moving it up then moving out to dr. pam

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:57.570
pam the billy-oh or my favorite Swedish

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.570
artists

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:08.420
hate these big rooms with marked as well

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.310
just like 10 times more annoying have to

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.260
get that sort okay okay

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.210
blood rights the main reason I want

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.530
blood rights is or the main reason I

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.210
want to spacebar item is so it works

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.160
with dim bulb this item does not work

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.500
with dim bulb in fact it doesn't work as

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.360
blue baby really at all either so it's

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:28.310
basically a waste of its own existence

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.930
here even after we get hit we can still

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.210
hurt ourselves in that period of them

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:35.570
vulnerable 'ti with blood rights so it's

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.730
like really not that good but I still

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:41.360
hold out hope that a couple of things

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:43.100
could happen jeez I hate this room such

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.990
a negative episode so far but only

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:48.410
because we've rear old into this weird

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:50.750
garbage fire where our stats are

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:53.120
actually okay but the the stuff going on

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.800
and the other aspects of the run is not

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.480
necessarily guaranteed that come to

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.070
fruition for us here and we're still

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.890
blue baby we haven't found a solution to

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:03.880
our spirit hard problem yet but we got

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.880
time we got a little time

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:17.450
rah mega is not that bad would be nice

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:19.700
to hit him when he's vulnerable I know I

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:23.780
know now it's rag mega but rah mega is

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:26.360
still a great name for absolutely no

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.850
reason whatsoever so I need like a deal

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.790
with the devil here 67% chance and still

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.920
got enough spirit hearts to take it

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:36.290
possibly okay we didn't get it but we

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:39.740
did get actually like a really really

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.240
good all stats upgrade that makes me

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.890
feel very weird about the fact that our

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.800
shot speed is so high we've got like a

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:48.740
freakin Alliser there like Randy Johnson

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:56.390
here what happens if we never okay good

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:58.190
one what happens if we never move one or

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:01.370
never shoot once we enter a room like we

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:02.990
never use we never move and thus mark

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.640
stays in the same place so we get to

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.650
keep camo underpants on the whole time

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.900
like enemies we'll never know where we

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.900
are we turn into our own little turret

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.730
I got to give it a shot this could make

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.950
me believe in this awful awful synergy

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.480
here by the way running into enemies I'm

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.370
going to go out on a limb and say that's

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.380
not going to be one of the tips we're

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:27.940
going to need to succeed on this run and

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:31.160
we do need to play intelligently because

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.790
things are getting quite dangerous for

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.890
us here

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:40.010
two and a half spirit I was we had like

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:44.840
six two rooms ago so so I mean obviously

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:48.710
the downside is that you can never move

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:51.250
marks they also seem to like still be

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:55.160
shooting at me a hundred percent so

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:58.750
they're also still jumping towards me so

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.750
I think that it just doesn't work at all

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:07.960
yeah I think you might just want to aim

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:13.040
at them and shoot because this is a

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:15.080
disaster Emperor card I actually think

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.309
we shouldn't use it right now but it's

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.420
not like two of hearts is doing anything

00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:19.880
for us we want to use this to like

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.530
teleport out of a room we hate and also

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.890
get to the boss immediately so the world

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:27.410
is useful there's another dice room I'm

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.030
actually like pinning my hopes and

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.620
dreams on this dice room I think there's

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.420
a decent chance we could still live and

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.240
survive and have a good fun time on this

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:40.940
run even without a reroll but it's going

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:42.890
to require some stats and I'm skeptical

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:47.210
as the stats will show up in the right

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:51.389
areas in time for us to succeed that

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:55.559
could be wrong straight

00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:57.209
I know what I was thinking with that

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:58.529
strength guard I guess I was just like

00:19:57.209 --> 00:20:01.469
let's just see how it affects us with

00:19:58.529 --> 00:20:04.649
Libra and it was good but obviously you

00:20:01.469 --> 00:20:06.149
know it's gone it's going to be an

00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:07.589
episode where we focus a little bit more

00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:14.159
on the Isaac commentary and all

00:20:07.589 --> 00:20:19.109
likelihood because we are running into

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:22.169
trouble the original title of Motley

00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:24.509
Crue's running with the devil dan Halen

00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:28.979
I always get the the Motley in the van

00:20:24.509 --> 00:20:30.959
Halen confused occasionally people go

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:33.089
you know that's ridiculously got the

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:39.659
wrong band but let's be honest they're

00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:45.239
kind of the same band they're both named

00:20:39.659 --> 00:20:47.969
after the guitarist obviously Eddie Van

00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:50.849
Halen for Van Halen and he's the singer

00:20:47.969 --> 00:20:52.440
actually haha they both kickstart hearts

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:54.749
I know that they both smoke in the boys

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:58.200
room and everybody knows that smokin

00:20:54.749 --> 00:21:00.359
ain't allowed in school Motley Crue is

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:07.009
named after John motley of course the

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:07.009
drummer which one had Dave Navarro in it

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.790
now I'm just making people mad for no

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.050
reason so one thing we could do with

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:21.210
marked is babysitted absurdly and

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:23.760
constantly keep it so close to us that

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:25.680
we can pivot in any direction and like a

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.780
moment's notice I think that might

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.250
actually be our best approach as we get

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.600
through this sure I'll take kidney stone

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.160
let's get weird with it sure that all

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.300
stats downgrade why wouldn't I take

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.780
kidney stone what a great choice

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.430
especially with a with a full floor of

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.520
item room rerolls that seems like a

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:46.460
pretty silly choice in hindsight luck up

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:49.230
is nice though I mean we have eight luck

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:52.020
so if we can just make it oh we have no

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:57.750
bombs I see if we can just make it to

00:21:52.020 --> 00:22:01.200
the to the chest we should start to pick

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:06.260
up inevitably hopefully enough items to

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:08.460
have a good shot at redemption right

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.900
it's a long way to go to get to the

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.840
chest we're not even close to make a

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:16.470
boss rush like that's implausible is not

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:18.630
possible short of getting mamma mega so

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.400
we probably I stand by not real rollin

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:23.880
Steam sale I think Steam sale is still

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.580
fine roughly at least but we should have

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:31.770
rear old kidney stone which is just not

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:34.160
good well I mean very temporarily we get

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:37.110
a nice all stats bonus when we fire

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.720
maybe that's worth it but I'm a little

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:42.480
skeptical kidneys still an egg I want to

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.490
like it but it just keeps making no

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.690
sense to take it like every time I get

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.640
it there's like another reason not to

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.620
take it oh it's a speed downgrade if you

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.750
have Libra it's an all stats downgrade

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.610
and it makes you stop firing when you

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.350
have marked you still have to manually

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:59.130
notice you're not firing and then look

00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:02.970
at oh you also can't move marked while

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:05.310
you have it dude this is like stop

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:08.190
drilling you've hit failure okay so

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:10.170
we're going to get an orbital this is

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.090
good effectively we've rear old our

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.430
first keep of meat into something else

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:18.510
so getting a second queue of meat is

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:21.090
actually nice we get all the value we

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.310
could have expected out of a first level

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.320
Kiva meat with none of the negatives of

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.730
the second

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.049
which is mostly just that it's slightly

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:34.039
less efficient all right damage was nice

00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:41.419
we can take a deal oh my god I can't

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:43.730
take a deal it's way too risky I don't

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:46.669
know man I don't know I think we should

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.509
save our emperor card or Deb's one Deb

00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:49.789
Stu okay

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:57.620
I was going to say that would be pretty

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:59.720
nasty situation okay blow this up range

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:09.080
up is an all stats up minor one but

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:12.950
still where as oh there it is it's a bit

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:14.570
of a bit of a tough call because dim

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.710
bulb oh never mind it's the easiest call

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.779
in the world we want to stick with dim

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.940
bulk okay so we got our first reroll

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:24.940
going here what is this I am the

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:34.250
happiest camper in the world our steps

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:37.279
Isan it our stats are really bad like

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:39.110
really really bad but the run looks cool

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:46.789
so we're going to roll with it for a

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:51.320
while here perks okay like art our

00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:55.700
synergies are cool we have like we have

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:57.320
lusty blood I think and some of our

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.539
stats are being accounted for by dim

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.980
bulb which is really not where you want

00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:02.960
to be like you don't want to be beholden

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.179
to a trinket for that much of your

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.740
damage unless I guess there's no other

00:25:05.179 --> 00:25:10.429
choice which is where we're at right now

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:12.679
but yeah we go down a 2.39 damage with a

00:25:10.429 --> 00:25:15.200
10 rate of fire like that doesn't seem

00:25:12.679 --> 00:25:16.429
like it should even be plausible so this

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:22.279
is going to get real old just because

00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:24.759
it's it's fun but it's not strong unless

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:27.350
we get like a huge stat increase somehow

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:31.789
unlikely to to stick with this one but

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:33.080
it's not horrible I think you could make

00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:35.090
a winning run out of this but you would

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.409
be annoyed certainly if we're going to

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.850
try to roll this one I'd like to have

00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:39.980
more HP to do so

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:43.880
this one's starting to look great rate

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:46.720
of fire is not good it's like chocolate

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:49.330
milk 2020 not my favorite combination

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.620
preferred you know chocolate milk and

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.000
like an Oreo cookie or something like

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.500
that that's a joke I don't drink milk

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.610
but I'm not going to go off on that

00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:01.070
tangent so a lot of like restaurant

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:03.110
music we only drink milk because we

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.669
think it's good for us I think it's the

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.870
way that it should be well you might

00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:09.280
drink because you like to taste and I

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.280
mean Who am I to say no to that right

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.580
I'd rather donate and yeah I was going

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.280
to say give some extra luck then worry

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.840
about the battery right now which is not

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:27.350
going to do anything for us anyway what

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:29.240
is our what is our respawn I'm losing it

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.070
I don't see a respawn oh no I do see one

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.750
the little coil over there I thought it

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:39.230
was bird poop but instead it says

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:46.880
Lazarus rags so we don't want to use

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:49.520
lavs rags good donations we also got to

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.929
luck I think out of our plays there so

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.309
I'm happy with that our speed is bad

00:26:50.929 --> 00:26:53.659
that's the real problem right now I

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:56.419
don't care about anything else we got

00:26:53.659 --> 00:26:57.770
eight lakh that's fine enemies are dying

00:26:56.419 --> 00:27:00.320
because we got five point five five

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.909
damage it's not that bad we actually it

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.090
is that bad because we had like seven

00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:08.809
something when dim-bulb was at its most

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:10.970
active so the dim bulb is never a

00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:12.830
negative all it does is like it masks

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.630
our bad base damage for a while so it

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:17.390
seems like a negative when it comes down

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.799
but you realize it's only artificial you

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.450
should never have gotten it in the first

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:21.980
place you know you shouldn't have gotten

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.780
accustomed to your high damage it was

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.510
only the unique conditions of the period

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.919
that allows you to enjoy the benefits of

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.659
having that high damage that you didn't

00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:32.570
deserve it's very much like a subprime

00:27:29.659 --> 00:27:33.679
mortgage in that regard man I think we

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.289
want that because we're probably going

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:39.559
to reroll this one it's ok the 20/20

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:44.270
chocolate milk it's like I mean as you

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:46.700
can tell the damage is good but this is

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:49.250
more like it

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.500
throwing out green and black bones left

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.880
right and center here with 12.3 damage

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.060
on each one some of them are razor

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.890
blades and the compound fractures

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.440
obviously break apart into smaller bones

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:03.350
that continue to orbit us I am very pro

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:06.020
this we also have Eve's mascara and yet

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.860
our damage are sorry our rate of fire is

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.900
not that bad

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.660
I also see that we have varicose veins

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.880
I'm 100% in for this we Emperor and this

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:16.640
gives us a chance to possibly fight hush

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:19.100
at some point you see that bone that was

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:25.730
shooting bones out of it this is a cool

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:28.970
run of course our damage has gotten way

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:32.690
down now that I look at it because we

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:36.410
actually didn't have 12 damage that was

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:39.080
only because we had dim bulb working for

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:42.170
us we got the same freaking situation

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:44.240
it's still pretty cool but little

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:46.880
underpowered and we still have a respawn

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:50.950
in here somewhere I want to fly you know

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.950
what for low on HP let's take it dude

00:28:51.010 --> 00:29:03.430
why would we do that that was a little

00:28:53.570 --> 00:29:07.190
dangerous our rate of fire is so bad

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:08.810
why did it was 14 on the boss fight now

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:16.150
it's 17 and it feels like it's twice as

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:16.150
slow stop

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:21.080
I think we hit them once there we go

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:27.690
spun now that's good damage not really

00:29:25.649 --> 00:29:29.220
actually but are all of our stats are

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.470
pretty good plus we got our HP back

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:34.740
we have conjoined I think though I don't

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:37.500
know man let's say anytime a run gets a

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:41.100
d4 we enter into this weird like you

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:43.409
know fugue state I've been overusing

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.899
that phrase lately B I think you sort of

00:29:43.409 --> 00:29:47.279
get the idea you know I did I always go

00:29:45.899 --> 00:29:49.320
maybe we'll stick with this one and then

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:51.659
I don't stick with that one I move it or

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.980
around up the Sun down I see where the

00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:54.809
bad guys are to be found and I make them

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.789
lay down but not out of violence out of

00:29:54.809 --> 00:29:59.779
love right we can't fly even though we

00:29:56.789 --> 00:30:03.690
just took empty vessel surprised to pain

00:29:59.779 --> 00:30:05.639
to be some big Shen like I am because

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.380
remember that Chris Rock song okay sorry

00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:08.929
Kid Rock song the Chris Rock song is

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:15.990
there's no sex in the champagne room

00:30:08.929 --> 00:30:20.450
it's been a while there's a song by Kid

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:23.820
Rock it's called all summer long it was

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:32.460
probably the most popular song in my

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:35.610
first summer of university 2007 there's

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:40.559
a song where there's a line in that song

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:44.130
that I always take issue with I'm trying

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:46.889
to think of what it is he rhymes the

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:50.250
same word with the same word and it's

00:30:46.889 --> 00:30:53.070
like nobody raked him over the coals for

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:55.830
that everybody's given Kayne nonsense

00:30:53.070 --> 00:31:00.750
for you know keep it 300 like the road

00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:02.760
like the Romans but nobody is getting on

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.840
Kid Rock's case so let me think about

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.169
this here

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:10.289
oh that's it and we were trying

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:14.130
different things we were smoking funny

00:31:10.289 --> 00:31:18.210
things and you're like he said things

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:20.880
twice nobody got on his case they you

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:24.179
know how many words rhyme with things

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:26.360
it's literally like 30% of the English

00:31:24.179 --> 00:31:31.429
language ends in ing

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:32.690
direct save your money you got to try to

00:31:31.429 --> 00:31:37.399
tell me this dude couldn't think of

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:38.929
another word that rhymes with pings and

00:31:37.399 --> 00:31:40.880
I know you're saying you do it if you're

00:31:38.929 --> 00:31:45.730
the master everyone waits with bated

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:49.250
breath we would trying different things

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:51.860
we were eating chicken wings and that

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:53.600
sounds like pretty stupid I'll admit but

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.690
keep in mind the whole song is about

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.799
like a carefree summer it totally works

00:31:55.690 --> 00:32:00.669
people might be like F silly why is he

00:31:57.799 --> 00:32:02.990
talking about eating chicken wings but

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:05.630
at least it doesn't rhyme with the same

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.940
word twice in a row that make the whole

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:17.870
song about chickens eating buffalo

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:19.100
chicken wings off some alone I can't get

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.409
a lyric out of my head now that gos

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.720
ranch dressing dad's blessing I don't

00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:27.559
know what's this red sky at night

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:31.159
sailor's delight you know ranch dressing

00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:36.620
in the morning dad's blessing more

00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:37.970
morning so this run I mean it's taking

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.149
its toll on me it's said goodbye too

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:43.610
many times before but I don't think I

00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:46.340
necessarily want to stick with it

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:47.840
although now I definitely wouldn't like

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.419
to stick with it because it's like a

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.159
really good I'm going to go fight hush

00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:53.480
though maybe picked up a second steam

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.470
say on the whole scheme of things there

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.380
I don't know in the whole scheme of

00:32:54.470 --> 00:33:03.649
things I think we've got to give it a

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:04.250
shot at least yeah this is the good

00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:08.690
stuff

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:11.049
okay how do you do this you take dark

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.049
Judas

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:21.309
and then you gotta hurt yourself a bunch

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:21.309
somehow that'll do it

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:33.049
then no we've been to too many rooms to

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:36.470
go back and get Avedon oh no no I've

00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:38.830
done it that's that's a whoopsie so the

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:45.259
intention there in case it wasn't clear

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:50.149
was I was going definitely want this I

00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:51.919
was going to murder myself with bombs to

00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:55.879
get teleported back into the devil room

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:57.860
and then we were going to be able to get

00:33:55.879 --> 00:34:05.929
Avedon in f6 HP with a bunch of extra

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:09.290
damage instead okay instead what we did

00:34:05.929 --> 00:34:12.079
was possibly contribute to us losing the

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:15.409
whole run I do want the compass just in

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:16.300
case we live here we have money equals

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:19.579
power

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.609
so actually what we should do is go hard

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:24.409
on money equals power

00:34:21.609 --> 00:34:26.370
we can still respawn as dark units so

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.560
that's what I want to keep in mind here

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.560
[Music]

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:37.500
screw it we can still do this we've got

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:39.720
ma the Boyd don't even sweat it

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.460
I mean sweated a little bit because it

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:46.350
was an idiotic decision on my part for

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:48.210
this to have ever happened but no

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:52.620
shielded tears I was checking rest

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:54.450
assured it sucks because the plane was

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:57.140
actually great and it would have doubled

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:59.580
our damage while also giving us Abaddon

00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:01.380
which would have left our HP roughly the

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:04.340
same but again giving us more damage and

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:08.810
fear shot not that that matters but

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:11.910
instead what we did is basically

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:16.530
inadvertently contribute to possibly

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:20.490
losing the run but we need this got to

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:23.790
do is summon a bunch of cheap enemies

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:27.930
that we can just like go wild on we did

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:29.670
not get hurt by that a bomb went off

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:35.760
right next to us we do we have holy

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:36.960
mantle it's definitely like you're going

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.460
to say that's one of the dumbest things

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.960
you've ever done in this game I'll be

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.270
straight up with you oh that's it was

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:48.180
this thing I see it's actually not even

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:51.300
in like the top probably 200 it was

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:53.010
pretty stupid but I mean not sure if you

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:56.550
notice but we've created and like

00:35:53.010 --> 00:36:00.260
quadruple two HP we had before basically

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:02.580
by doing nothing at all so we're still

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:06.570
completely okay apparently we can't

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.830
create anymore but even still you know

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:11.060
the maw of the void pick up was

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.060
definitely the right decision

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.030
I don't know if we're immune to bombs or

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:27.480
we actually have holy mantle or what's

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:29.550
going on there so if we're going to

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:32.100
reroll this run and I have a temptation

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:35.700
to do so I'll admit it to you in no

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:40.050
uncertain terms if we're going to

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:42.180
re-roll this run we probably want to

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:45.900
become dark Judas first so we'll think

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:48.240
about that as we progress onwards here

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.310
we usually reroll into HP so it'll just

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.260
be nice to have every run get some extra

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:56.220
damage so we definitely have holy mantle

00:36:52.260 --> 00:37:01.580
that's the that's how we got that HP

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.580
there you know what leave that HP there

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:09.060
this way if we want to become dark Judas

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:13.230
we can at least get one extra HP out of

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:16.560
it before we reroll this hushed I ended

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:18.930
up being actually really really easy not

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.470
done yet but like let's be honest pretty

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.470
much done

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:30.240
what have we done we'd accidentally

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.240
inverted his nipple

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.630
all right just keep it going just keep

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.119
it going you're never going to hit me

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.619
with that why I don't know I don't make

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:47.180
the rules three pretty flies are helping

00:37:45.619 --> 00:37:52.070
out a lot I assumed as part of the deal

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:54.530
here you've opted out of your own

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:58.100
existence buddy just firing continuum

00:37:54.530 --> 00:38:01.250
shots all day long who you eatin

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:06.800
different things you were making chicken

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:10.340
wings singing your favorites disco song

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.770
that starts with the thumb does it

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.750
really work at all busy so we blow

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:17.990
ourselves up and we blow ourselves up

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:19.430
and we blow ourselves up and then we

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.440
wait until our admits ability goes we

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:26.119
blow ourselves up we walk out of the

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:28.340
room blow ourselves up blow ourselves up

00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:30.200
again use like 12 bombs to hurt

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:32.869
ourselves three times it's not a great

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.869
play on my part but hey our damage is

00:38:32.869 --> 00:38:37.280
better what do we got in here again

00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:41.810
glass can and that's right I remember

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:44.030
that what a funny experience that was I

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:47.570
can't believe we made it work I can sort

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:54.140
of believe we made it work all right

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:55.880
on the cathedral reroll the run now we

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:58.390
have conjoined I guess last time we

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:01.720
didn't have conjoined we just had a

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.720
dunce cap

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:11.830
I don't know what happened on that room

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.830
if I'm being honest with you

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:22.640
do we have nod Leif no we just have not

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:24.910
Leif we just a little weird looking it's

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:28.000
okay

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:30.440
appreciate the spirit hearts either way

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:37.280
we must have some kind of like fruitcake

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:41.900
or $3 bill because our tier effects are

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.800
changing room to room it look be honest

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.120
we're going to re-roll the whole run

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.380
anyway so it doesn't matter too too much

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:50.450
I freakin boss fights over there it

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:55.490
could be this way I don't think it is

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:57.980
but it could be this way fifty two

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:59.870
damage with crickets body this is the

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.660
dream even though we have Isaac's heart

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:08.930
this is the dream this is the run you

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:11.780
write home about it's just all bombs Wow

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:13.550
our do the damage gets so much worse so

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.610
quickly with dim bulb it's like only

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:18.680
briefly acceptable but it's still a

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:21.050
really good we didn't need fifty damage

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.640
to make this run work yeah I don't want

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:25.240
to re-roll this one this is the the one

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.240
you've write home about

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:30.560
well we've had a nice little love sweet

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.080
of production on these runs lately you

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.120
know we've managed to succeed on some

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.890
runs that seemed unsuccessful like our

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.720
first floor on this Ryan we're not done

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:40.700
with this one yet but our first floor on

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:48.260
this one was a nightmare and yet we made

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:49.640
it work and our our role that we kind of

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:54.650
grandfathered ourself into here is

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:57.890
fantastic all we got to do is hold

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:59.300
steady could afford to change drink it's

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.470
not that this one hurts us but we could

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.910
afford to change that something that

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:05.380
actually helps us at this point

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.380
oh he's frozen

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.330
don't forget to yera I often forget to

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.480
yera

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:14.700
we're going to not forget the era you

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:19.950
might have taro cloth do not have taro

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:21.780
cloth please double our damage no point

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:24.800
eight nine that's not it's not even

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:27.240
close to a doubling sinus infection I

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.040
don't know kind of it usually this

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.140
happens it's the phenomenon of just

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.480
getting like almost exclusively junk

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.530
items on the on the chest after you've

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:41.000
been using the D for like crazy

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:41.000
we definitely have strange attractor

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.140
leading to me taking some damage I'm not

00:41:44.609 --> 00:41:47.250
super proud of but the thing with the d4

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.670
is that it's also a get-out-of-jail-free

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:53.400
card so if we have to re-roll we can

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:56.700
probably do so and get ourselves back to

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:59.180
a level of HP that's appropriate we also

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:03.380
have Isaac's heart so I'm kind of

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.380
putting myself in a tough spot there

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.240
bomber boy always a little bit dicey ooh

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:13.859
okay

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:15.480
Robo baby pretty much terrible I think

00:42:13.859 --> 00:42:17.099
I'm going to re-roll I know I said I

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.670
wouldn't reroll and this is very very

00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:23.190
strong I like it a lot but you know

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.990
variety is the spice of life that and

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:28.560
you know I mean let's be honest salt and

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:33.960
pepper really okay how's this one it

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:37.170
seems pretty not great but looks can be

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:40.020
deceptive as Brad Pitt said and burn

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:41.490
after reading for one more reroll in

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.770
here just for good luck and look at that

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:49.470
we get the classic final reroll item

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:51.180
Eden's blessing so that on our next run

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:54.349
we're going to be in like the greatest

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.349
position you could ever imagine

00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:03.290
I would do the void on this one

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.510
we got the HP we got to get out of jail

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.650
free we got the base underlying stamps I

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:09.920
shouldn't have said it

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:11.270
because now I'm committed dang it

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.800
you notice the dark you just look like

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:15.650
potion seller for a second there when he

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.230
went into the portal you can't handle my

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.850
strongest rerolls etc etc so now we

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:22.700
should stick with the run that works and

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:26.480
I'm not too upset about losing the last

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.800
one because although it possibly would

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.630
have worked we were taking a lot of

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.790
damage it was kind of an uncontrollable

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.550
like Incredible Hulk sort of situation

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:35.960
you notice we got like a little

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:41.900
Christmas thing going on here with all

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:49.130
of our blood and bile dreaming of a

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:52.100
gross Christmas try re-roll all stats

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:58.370
went up except tears which went down but

00:43:52.100 --> 00:44:01.400
I do like bloody lust on a floor this

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:03.230
long I don't think this is a great floor

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.380
for momma mega I don't think we're

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.580
gutting a lot of flies we must have well

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.140
we do have the Mulligan you can see it

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.430
right there

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:13.400
now we can also see where all the

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:18.890
enemies are you must have a compass of

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:22.870
something there's still a living spider

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.870
somewhere Varys

00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:29.410
what did we blow up if you took no

00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:31.599
damage I have to know the Bible doesn't

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:33.460
even give us bookworm what a waste it's

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:39.430
an embarrassment your mother is very

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:41.410
upset right now I don't know if we lose

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:43.479
the bloody loss damage if we reroll but

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:45.220
you know I'm content to continue kind of

00:44:43.479 --> 00:44:47.739
going for it here because what you know

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:49.539
when you get to D for as long as you're

00:44:47.739 --> 00:44:51.460
not in danger of breakfasting yourself I

00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:53.200
think you're good and I mean we have not

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:56.229
had to be for long enough to worry about

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:59.200
breakfasting ourselves I know because we

00:44:56.229 --> 00:45:01.900
did an Isaac run on the LSS like three

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.239
days ago I had to be 100 it took me a

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:07.229
few floors to breakfast myself we good

00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:09.910
year of the nonsense

00:45:07.229 --> 00:45:14.589
let's open it be a pacano rune and give

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:17.019
us almost no appreciable benefit so I

00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:19.450
think the secret is you go into the boss

00:45:17.019 --> 00:45:21.039
fight see what you get if you get a boss

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.690
you don't like you can reroll midway

00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:24.309
through the boss fight and maybe your

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:28.630
life is going to be easier as a result

00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:32.289
that's my my diagnosis for a successful

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:33.489
run here I don't think we've been hit

00:45:32.289 --> 00:45:37.960
since we've had this run we should

00:45:33.489 --> 00:45:39.309
really like take a take a cue maybe some

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.779
of the other letters in the alphabet as

00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:46.859
well okay

00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:49.660
I have greed I'm hoping to fight a

00:45:46.859 --> 00:45:53.049
delirium quickly and that's exactly how

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:57.579
she goes bud devil hanged man like a

00:45:53.049 --> 00:45:59.769
poppet but oh he gets frozen yeah we got

00:45:57.579 --> 00:46:01.630
this easily I think but if you really

00:45:59.769 --> 00:46:03.279
want to go nightmare mode and possibly

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:06.569
ruin the streak you reroll midway

00:46:03.279 --> 00:46:16.289
through am I going to do that yeah

00:46:06.569 --> 00:46:16.289
allora let's go we got like all stats up

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:27.400
one two three four five that's pretty

00:46:21.769 --> 00:46:27.400
cool still doing decent damage

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.790
kind of hard to aim

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.289
apparently it's getting the job done

00:46:39.869 --> 00:46:42.289
though

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:54.030
that was six unless they threw an

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.500
explosion at me so I think we just won

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:59.710
because were the world's greatest player

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:03.550
the binding of issac it was a fun run no

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:05.230
doubt very scary in the opening but at

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.460
the end we began our Judas this is the

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.450
run that should have been the Azazel run

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.470
but for now thanks for watching hope you

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:09.490
