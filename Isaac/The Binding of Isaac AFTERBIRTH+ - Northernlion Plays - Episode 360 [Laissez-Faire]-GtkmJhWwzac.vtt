00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
hey everybody welcome back to nor the

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.950
lion plays The Binding of Isaac after

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.290
birth plus we're chewing along here on

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:14.040
our new save seven-plus hard containers

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
55 pennies that's ridiculous two levels

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.039
without taking damage but we got dark

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.090
boy last time how to get dark boy

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.560
without having two levels where you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.689
don't take damage Lazarus of course

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.480
where's my where's my posted note I beat

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.400
mom I beat mama on the last run you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.759
didn't the posted though didn't fill in

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.800
oh well um it's not like we're never

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
going to be mom again let's do an IVA

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.270
run here we're going to look for ideally

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.210
maybe fifty five pennies so we can on

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.820
law cane we got a long way to go and

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.230
again what I would ask one one AF Zorka

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.239
what I'm going to ask is that you have

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.280
mercy if you don't we don't even have

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.090
the razorblade unlock disease yet if you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.410
don't like new save file recognize I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.600
always have a little bit of a backlog

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.789
enjoy the variety and then you know send

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.620
me as a little tweet that goes I hate

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.329
this so maybe I'll take another poll but

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.710
if you love it send me a tweet that says

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.290
I love this and then just don't attach a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.840
picture of your testicles and we're all

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250
good to go here um I had a good time in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.680
the last run although I will admit I was

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
surprised that it ended it mom without

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.020
us getting the chance to do boss rush

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.700
but I digress hopefully we'll be able to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.320
fit in a couple of runs here but you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.939
never know does it still ended mom now

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.140
or do we have mom's heart how much do

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.280
you'd be mom's foot ten times to get

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.829
mama left I can't remember

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.920
dude pyromaniac is like a disgusting

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.659
item we got the wafer in our first run

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.350
and then pyromaniac in our second run

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.119
here you know what I'm actually now that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.799
I think about it isn't there like after

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.619
you beat it 10 times it goes like the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.259
basement gets harder we might be dealing

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.909
with like seeds that are weighted to our

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.909
advantage even more than traditional

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.229
northernlion luck is but we don't need

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.430
to talk about Isaac just cuz we're

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.960
playing eyes it doesn't mean we need to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.899
talk about Isaac we're all familiar with

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.520
how the game goes don't be a lame you

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.870
know the game and how it goes we trying

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:20.280
to get shows

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:23.340
I have to apologize to youtube.com /

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.099
matt has game think that's who it is I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.659
don't know might go by a different alias

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.590
now I know he used to be Mathis

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.950
Starcraft

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.200
I think the bubble is popped on that the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.000
the Starcraft bubble in the Isaac

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.599
bubbler in the same place right now but

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.069
he tweeted me yesterday and I took

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.720
offense to it and I don't think I should

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.519
have he said I was watching NL played

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.980
Kerbal space program and then blah blah

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.599
blah he tried to launch a space plane

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.069
without having any wheels on it it just

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.370
sort of skidded along the ground until

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.810
it exploded it's hard to watch and then

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.160
I sent him a tweet and I said now you

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.980
know how I felt when I watched you play

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.840
Isaac and immediately people were like

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.819
that was uncalled for given the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.579
circumstance he may have roasted you a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.530
little bit but you like you know you

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.530
took it to the extreme so I'm going to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.390
apologize to man has games the truth of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.840
the matter is that I didn't watch him

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.870
play Isaac Kate watched him play Isaac

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.370
and I gazed on on the other side of the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.470
screen I'm just joking of course I've

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.940
seen Malthus play Isaac he's a good

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.980
player I mean that sincerely secret room

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.709
is the is he the second best player in

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.079
the NL SS group no I would say wow that

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.970
was so bad in me I've actually been

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.090
playing pretty badly here on the last

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.230
two runs to be honest with you so I'm

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.629
bull jeez that was close I'm very

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.709
thankful that we've gotten

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.639
apparently the luckiest seeds of all

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.870
time but I think's Invicta I mean he

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.310
might even be better than I am to be

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.870
honest with you so Invictus up there any

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.840
Cobalt obviously is a better player

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.790
that's no debate but it's not like we're

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.290
really in sin in eSports territory with

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.079
Isaac so it's kind of irrelevant but

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.489
Mathis is like a genuinely good player I

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.859
think he's had one of those streaks that

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.709
was like you know you feel like you're

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.629
never going to lose again and then you

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.250
lose but for a while you feel like a god

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.410
and that's that's very important so

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.840
we're gonna blow ourselves up here we

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.039
did so up because there was a champion

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.030
that could have killed us in one hit I

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.450
would have loved to stay Whore of

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.190
Babylon state for even longer but so we

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.120
do have two of diamonds as well

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.850
all very happy yeah why not very happy

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.410
to have two of diamonds because we can

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.310
use that to more easily get cane unlocks

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.500
remember we can't really blow up our

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.880
donation machine so we got to we got to

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.000
figure it out the old-fashioned way here

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.910
we got seven cents we need twenty

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.420
something I guess we need 28 to get cane

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.860
unlocked that's no problem

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.870
should have gone like a little bit

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.570
longer here and gotten the charge

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.420
available but our for us for crack this

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.220
guy dude this damage is actually sort of

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.660
inexcusable I got to be honest like I'm

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.250
feeling like in a little bit of a game

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.050
play funk today but that's no excuse you

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.690
know execute the patterns that you know

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.310
work here

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.990
speed up grain is fine know who our

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.560
babylon available know deal with the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.170
devil but again the I mean I pretty much

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.370
created a situation in which we didn't

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.300
have a good chance to get a deal with

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.210
the devil so I digress I digress I

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.970
continued my my march through the Marvel

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.000
Cinematic Universe yesterday there's

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.360
only a few of the MCU films I have not

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.340
seen and I think I told you but man I

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.990
actually said that as if I was having a

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.690
conversation with another human being I

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.250
think I told you but Kate's been

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.860
watching the Marvel films recently

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.140
viewer might recall that but now she's

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.260
like she's on phase one and I mean she's

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.390
seen almost all of them as well right we

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.100
can actually blow these guys up with

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.919
little risk to ourselves unless they

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.510
hurt us when they like they shoot

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.590
bullets or you know leave creep when

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:11.340
they die we watched Thor last night what

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.860
a strange movie just it feels like I'm

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.370
not going to say the aged badly excuse

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.250
me we got hit by an explosion there

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.450
maybe there was a bullet I didn't see

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.650
I'm not going to say it's aged badly

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.510
because I don't think that's fair I

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.300
don't think it's a bad movie it's just a

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.120
very weird movie like half of it and I

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.900
have no idea why they would do this but

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.160
like a half of the movie is shot at a

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.539
45-degree angle as if it's battlefield

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.169
earth and I actually this is going to

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.939
sound like so made up but in

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:45.800
head I was like did kenneth branagh

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:47.449
direct this and then gets to the end of

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.069
the movie powell directed by Kenneth

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.300
Branagh and I was like that's probably

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.779
not how he pronounces me but I was like

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:58.909
test your chest Lovelace I remember his

00:06:53.779 --> 00:07:00.560
2005 or not 2005 like 2000 version of

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:04.189
Hamlet and I was like this looks kind of

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:07.520
like that which is a great film by the

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:09.319
way but I digress if you got the choice

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.740
between the Kenneth Branagh version of

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:13.099
Hamlet and the Mel Gibson version of

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.520
Hamlet

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:18.409
take the can of Branagh version you are

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.370
going to like if your teachers like

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:24.020
we're going to be watching the Mel

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:27.080
Gibson version go teller the Soulja Boy

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.490
first off great all-time classic hip hop

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:34.879
genre and then secondly tell him or her

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:36.289
such a bad play that you refuse then you

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:39.080
should watch the Kenneth Branagh version

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:42.680
instead and then just trigger and put

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:46.219
Thor on it's not a bad movie the Thor

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.800
that is um it's none that's certainly

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:53.719
not top 10 Marvel Cinematic Universe but

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:58.279
oh my god I'm actually embarrassed my

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:59.569
play here also it freaks me out and I

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:04.129
don't know if anybody else has had this

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:06.770
revelation but the guy who plays Loki

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:08.599
Tom Hiddleston reminds me too much of

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.469
Josh for me to take any parts of that

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:11.469
movie seriously

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.650
also did not get a deal with the devil

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:22.420
and you know what also did not deserve a

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.420
deal with the devil I'll own up to that

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.570
like I'm not afraid to say it I think

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.330
Josh I know Tom

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:32.480

worked out in the end though you know

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.700
what what better a way to ride out the

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.690
are you a wizard recession and I just

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.460
rockin this here and seeing if this

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.810
works for us lemonparty not worth

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:31.460
anything come on come on come on come on

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:37.120
let's freaking go that's a huge play we

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:39.230
are like so far behind on our no I just

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.370
accidental well we got 100% deal with

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.620
the devil chance oh don't sweat it too

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:45.560
much yet but I just screwed myself out

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.460
of the boss trap room and temporary

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.830
Whore of Babylon

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.990
it hurts we've got three point eight

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:55.070
nine damage after getting like a big

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:57.560
turn of events for us here what an

00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:02.000
enormous bummer but if you can't beat

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:04.910
mom honestly you got to take that up

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.960
with with you you're darn self because

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:12.160
this should not be a very difficult

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:14.270
situation to find ourselves in here

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.880
we're just trying to get things checked

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.230
off the to-do list

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.790
we're also it's kind of like you know I

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:23.230
said on even runs we can kind of

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:25.880
experience and appreciate items that

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:29.830
otherwise kind of fall by the wayside a

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.830
little bit I feel the same way about

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.330
about our new save file here items like

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:38.090
crack the sky showing up I'm like these

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:40.430
are three darn okay

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.380
not that I haven't been anti crack the

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.970
sky for quite some time there was a

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:48.470
period in my life where I wasn't the

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:51.560
biggest fan of it but that that train is

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:53.330
sailed and if you think that that's a

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.230
joke that train is sailed have you ever

00:12:53.330 --> 00:13:02.660
seen me play Kerbal space program not

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:05.900
the best when it comes to methods of

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.640
transportation so I'm not going to go to

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.930
the shop because I want to save as much

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.470
money as possible I was actually hoping

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.730
we'd come across an arcade that had a

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:18.860
blood bank in it because the blood bank

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:20.690
obviously gives us the ability to get

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.720
some more money out of it sadly we're

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.460
just going to inch by inch row by row

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.610
got to make that garden grow seven point

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.380
nine eight damage is completely

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:32.450
absolutely acceptable we no longer have

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.980
to rely on you know little Gertie to get

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:37.340
the job done for us here and that was a

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.050
nice dodge from peep as well you know

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.050
via the next level

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:44.120
Issac savefile strats is you do a new

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.160
save file and then you delete it if you

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:50.060
ever get hit and see who can get the

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.720
most wins in a row I would give myself

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.610
about a 1 in 500 chance of making it

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.230
through the first run but I'd give

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:03.050
myself like a one in two chance of

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:04.610
making it through the first floor if

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.960
we're just trying to get Cain we

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.340
shouldn't I mean this is exactly where

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:12.410
we want to be maybe some more money

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:16.280
please stat get me wrong don't start

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:20.480
getting me right to do to do you the

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:23.840
face is ok to move on to Butchie persons

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:27.170
to in time to talk to you I'm looking

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.570
for loose bills large change a just

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:33.260
anything give me some

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.940
it's a spinal tap reference acoustic now

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:38.240
if you haven't seen smile to have turned

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:41.090
this video off and find a way to legally

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.160
obtain spinal tap which is actually

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.740
called this is spinal tap and watch it

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.050
one of the greatest films in American

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.060
cinema history a heck of a lot better

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.830
than the Thor I'm going to tell you that

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.290
much now the Thor is terrible I'm not

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:57.260
saying that we don't want that we're not

00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:02.600
locking Maggie on this around anyway not

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:04.340
that Thor is terrible but spinal tap

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.620
exists in another world's got Harry

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.850
Shearer you may know him as Principal

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.370
Skinner from The Simpsons

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:13.700
it's got Michael McKean you may know him

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.440
as Nigel whatever from this is spinal

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.110
tap and Christopher Guest who you may

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.850
know from other films by Christopher

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:23.570
Guest

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:25.820
it also has Fran Drescher she plays a

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.440
record company executive and you watched

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.100
the movie and you go that can't be Fran

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.280
Drescher

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.230
she looks great but she looks exactly

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:40.570
the same as she does now how is that

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:43.790
even possible but it is Fran Drescher as

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:45.260
mind-boggling as it may seem trying to

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.600
think of who else is even in that movie

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.150
it's been always anyway the point is go

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.640
watch it

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:54.830
it burns memes before memes even existed

00:15:52.640 --> 00:16:01.010
when they were just a twinkle in Richard

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:04.910
Dawkins eye this has been another

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:09.020
episode of NL recommends movies thanks

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:13.550
for watching we'll definitely take in

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:19.100
for me golden keys are not noise

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:20.720
pollution get absolutely dusted I kind

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:27.260
of want to teleport if I'm being honest

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:29.030
but I'll resist the notion you know was

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.710
weird was finishing these runs are

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.720
finishing the last run and not getting a

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.990
trophy at the end I was like in full on

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.490
daily expectation mode like you can't

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:41.759
finish your run without the trophy

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:45.399
showing up doesn't it's just not right

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:52.360
we are five cents shy please we're five

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:54.339
cents shy of being able to get cane

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.139
unlocks and then we'll do our next run

00:16:54.339 --> 00:16:58.420
with cane which is like my dream come

00:16:56.139 --> 00:17:02.319
true personally one of my favorite

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.240
characters in Isaac history I'll take it

00:17:02.319 --> 00:17:08.829
but I got to admit I'm a little scared

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:12.370
about taking it reminds me of a little

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:14.679
ditty for Janis Joplin take it and take

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:20.829
another dangerous deal with the devil

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:27.250
baby won't break it break another pill

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:27.730
mouths is going nowhere you know you got

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:33.940
it

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:39.789
you get anything improves your DPS dude

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:42.610
dude come on though I need 534 cents at

00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:45.250
this point and you're gonna sit here on

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.570
the day of my daughter's wedding tell me

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.740
you're not going to find a way to get

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.470
four cents extra

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.850
into this run I might as well go to our

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.419
shop it could be fighting greed that

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.419
would be perfect

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.730
we're overdue for a good parody we've

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.110
had I mean I hesitate to even mention it

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.970
because every time I mention it I get a

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:06.130
couple of people who seem genuinely not

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.169
very happy about it but you know sack of

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.150
sacks I still stand by a sack of sacks

00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:11.559
to the tune of black and black you know

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.090
I'm not saying it's the greatest song

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:15.100
we've ever had but it makes the greatest

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.289
hits collection you know is it down

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.570
under or over killed no they might just

00:18:17.289 --> 00:18:22.000
be you know upstairs in my house but

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:24.580
it's still making contraband the best of

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.030
men at work from 1996 one of the top

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:34.179
albums of 2017 we got 28 cents there we

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:36.370
go we hit it we all knocked cane like a

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:39.030
Ted Leo song and whether we could run

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:41.980
converter but what do we care instead

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:44.730
you know what there's actually an

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:47.370
achievement that was such a bad play but

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:51.870
there's an achievement for beating mom

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:54.020
with the Bible so we should actually

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.420
absolutely take this

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.670
as ridiculous as it might seem in this

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.560
is a good run for BFF as well and it's a

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.020
great run to have the strength card

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:06.620
unlike extremely pro everything that

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:08.180
just happened there we're still not

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.800
going to be able to do bas rush I think

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:14.960
but you know there's a lot of positive

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.660
stuff that just happen here not least of

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.160
which is BFF little Gertie not so little

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:30.440
anymore you know be careful who you call

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:32.360
ugly in middle school why not at this

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.710
point why not if they let us fight mom

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.210
and then move on from there we can snag

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.980
like a second deal with the devil and be

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.210
good to go

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.650
we can snag a deal with the devil and be

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.150
good to go it's negative second feelers

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.800
devil I mean we could just cheese it up

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.050
and go down to the womb here but it's

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.510
actually like surprisingly valuable to

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.370
kill mom with the with the Bible so I'm

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.660
going to say that this is a good

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:54.650
investment for us right now

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:57.950
it's a red chest in there you almost got

00:19:54.650 --> 00:20:00.050
me you lucky so-and-so thank God I went

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:03.560
back for those two spiders they might

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:05.570
have been lonely Plus what is that like

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.150
a four square foot apartment they're the

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:10.490
size of that chest so in San Francisco

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:13.090
it would be 1.2 million dollars

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:16.070
oh the housing market has been

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:18.550
permanently poisoned by a lack of supply

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:23.780
and speculative real estate investing

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:26.630
but it's a living it's pretty wild like

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.460
I the obvious answer to this question is

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.970
move and I don't mean to make things too

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.560
real

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:36.500
but in Vancouver over like the last five

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.210
years housing prices have gone up from

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.430
like okay on average of course but

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.470
they've gone up from like an average

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:45.830
single-family detached home being like

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.840
850 thousand dollars to an average

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.030
single-family detached home being 1.2

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:54.350
million dollars or higher which

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:57.230
effectively means that people who have

00:20:54.350 --> 00:21:00.050
owned a house have made like $80,000 a

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:02.270
year on their net worth just by owning

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:05.280
the house that's amazing

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:08.120
like sign me up for that job dude

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.380
so here's here's the duties of the

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.000
owning real estate you need to own real

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.900
estate you do need to pay the property

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.360
taxes there's no doubt about that

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.850
and you know if something breaks fix it

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.810
and you get to live you you work where

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:26.810
you live for this job which is good and

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:29.670
it pays eighty thousand dollars a year

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:32.820
where do I sign up for that gig well the

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:35.370
answer is being born in the 1970s or

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:38.250
earlier I don't know why I'm rushing we

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:40.170
don't need to fight boss rush here in

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.620
fact we're way better off not fighting

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:45.210
boss rush focusing on like one one

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:50.370
positive at a time we already unlocked

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:53.430
Caine we certainly are not going to

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:55.410
unlock Samson playing like this it's a

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.180
bit of a lazy play on my part so to

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.010
still be using my orbital to deal the

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.960
damage reroll me I'm ready for it re

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:06.780
rolling I knew they wouldn't have the

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:09.270
sack so what's that what else is on the

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.710
to-do list for this run donate as much

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.300
money to the donation machine as

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:16.890
possible so that we can get shops that

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:19.800
have more than scary we can get shops

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:23.130
that have more than two things in them I

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.940
think is a big positive continue to give

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:28.860
some money to our donation machine if I

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.000
mention the donation machine yet I think

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.080
we should give some money to the

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.080
donation machine

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.370
but in a way I'm kind of like the

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:47.480
benefactor of that like real estate

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:53.410
situation but like for YouTube you know

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:56.450
if you're like 30 which I borderline am

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:58.550
you were right around you know the

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.560
raywilliamjohnson era of being able to

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:03.530
make it big on YouTube just by virtue of

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.030
basically existing you know just say

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.280
this game just came out play it on

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.990
YouTube here's like you know 500

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.100
subscribers this is it's a great way to

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.170
get started right

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.030
nowadays like if you're born in like the

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.100
year 2004 and you're trying to make it

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.900
as a youtuber not impossible there's

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.340
definitely you know youtubers who have

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.170
started after me that have gotten much

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.500
bigger without a doubt there's no

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:27.410
donation machine you mess with me but

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:30.260
it's it's certainly harder you know so

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:31.880
you have my you have my sympathy and you

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.220
might say that's not fair and you would

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.590
basically be right but on the other hand

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.300
like you guys have a much greater chance

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:42.230
of if you're younger than me at least

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:44.650
making it to immortal life so it's hard

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:46.910
for me to be sympathetic because ya

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:49.100
might have gotten in on YouTube when the

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.800
competition was a little lower and same

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.210
for twitch but at the same time you

00:23:51.800 --> 00:24:02.690
might live forever

00:23:53.210 --> 00:24:06.800
so I we have holy mantle 404 is given us

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:08.330
holy mantle nice um so you honestly in

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.220
the end you're going to be laughing if

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.140
you end up living forever and I don't

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:16.800
I'll be cheesed off if there's such a

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:21.090
thing as ghosts oh dusted

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:25.470
oh we get to keep going now - yeah you

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:27.060
know what I will do this I'm going to be

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.470
real cheesed if I'm a ghost and I have

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.820
to haunt some people who are freaking

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:35.070
immortal that ghosts why are you mad I

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.560
was ripped from this mortal coil just

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:39.000
prior to the release of the technology

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.680
that allowed us to become immortal

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.750
honestly ghost that seems like a pretty

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.030
sweet reason to be mad so I can't even

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.680
be mad at you no stop being nice and

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.920
understanding I have to haunt you for

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:54.290
infinity years oh it was a cute little

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.290
ghost it was a cute angry little ghost

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:02.420
probably shouldn't you know all that's

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.420
so good

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:11.760
he has not done it

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.930
amnesia doesn't matter I tell you what

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.470
we should have picked up the polaroid

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:18.450
was there even a Polaroid don't do what

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:22.500
I'm doing here this is so stupid alright

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:25.670
ok so slow this guy out lucky Rocco's

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:28.740
appeared in the basement let's go I

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:31.440
don't remember how like 90% of things in

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:34.220
Isaac are unlocked so this is a whole

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:39.270
new world for me please give me some HP

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:41.100
that'll do it looking for anything that

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:44.640
gives me a single sphere at heart in

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.740
return and tears up maybe full health ok

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.160
can't complain too hard actually the

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:52.410
pills are probably more useful right now

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:57.780
and we got HP we got it there is a time

00:25:52.410 --> 00:26:01.320
in Isaac where you could get uh you

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:03.780
could get an item from mom like before

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:08.040
you unlock the polaroid yes I had no

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:09.810
idea by the way I am this is coming from

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.240
not the character of Northern Line this

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.040
is coming from Ryan I apologize for

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.410
making like the worst Eve based

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.480
decisions on this run I'm playing a

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.580
laissez faire style of game and it's not

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.400
a smart decision on my part we have two

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.460
and a half HP and pretty not amazing

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.890
stats as Eden as a receive as a result

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.620
of my own idiocy so I recognize

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:34.020
I'm the one messing this up and I I'm

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:42.540
not happy about it yet I continue to be

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:44.850
the arbiter of my own demise so I'm my

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.590
Isaac self-confidence is not very high

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.330
right now but you know what to pull out

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.880
a win here would feel pretty solid

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.470
we should really just stack up bombs so

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:57.350
that we can always have a little bit of

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:59.970
resiliency for a pyromaniac to work and

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:01.950
stop for God's sakes unless you're in

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:06.870
that like powerful sort of situation

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:08.610
stop running into enemies to hit them

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.650
with your orbital that's like I'm

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:13.260
playing like this is my third Isaac run

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.970
ever none of these are going to mom's

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.440
heart I actually don't feel as bad about

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:21.630
the fact that the runs are a little bit

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:23.160
shorter as well because then I really

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.720
thought you had to do 10 that go to mom

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.480
first oh you know what it's after you

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.700
beat mom's watches after you beat mom's

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.000
heart ten times you get it lives

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.500
I forgot we've got like a genuine

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.930
plausible mom's heart situation how

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:43.020
strange how quaint lemonparty good pill

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:51.810
amnesia not so much to be honest with

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:53.160
you you know what like I think there are

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.360
better jobs out there than being a

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.030
youtuber you know what I think is

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.940
actually the greatest job on planet

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.820
earth is being Guy Fieri on diners

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:05.760
drive-ins and dives let me explain to

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.590
you why first off very popular show it's

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.420
not the kind of show I'm sure we like if

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.760
I ask you when is diners drive-ins and

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.050
dives on when are new episodes on you

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.840
would be I don't know I just turn on the

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:17.790
Food Network and they make 18 episodes a

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.280
day so there's always one I haven't seen

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.120
you you know going on and that's very

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.470
very true

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.640
can we get we don't have permanent

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.820
Polaroid miscibility so don't worry

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.980
about this just grab your HP and go

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:30.390
here's what Guy Fieri does they I know

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.980
they show them driving but let's be

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.110
honest he's flying to all these places

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.150
they go hey guy there's a good

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:39.000
restaurant in Charlotte North Carolina

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.100
we're going to fly you first-class to

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.419
Charlotte North Carolina you're going to

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.119
eat like

00:28:42.419 --> 00:28:46.950
three bites of four delicious dishes and

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:50.249
all you have to do you don't have the

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:52.109
mantle of criticism being a critic is

00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:56.249
totally fine you know giving your honest

00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:58.950
opinion on things of course but all guys

00:28:56.249 --> 00:29:02.549
the area has to do is go whole that's

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:04.350
why I'm a jamon you know he's always he

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:06.179
gets to be positive no matter what so he

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.159
never gets any backlash about it's not

00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:10.259
like anybody's going to go to you know

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:11.940
Rick's Crab Shack on Guy Fieri's

00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:15.059
recommendation and be like guy this

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:17.909
thing sucks you sellout you know what

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:19.619
you're getting into he gets paid I'm

00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:22.320
sure like fifty thousand dollars in

00:29:19.619 --> 00:29:25.019
episode or something like that and then

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.609
like you have fans there are people who

00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:29.639
like really like Guy Fieri and he does

00:29:26.609 --> 00:29:30.899
have like haters online for sure but at

00:29:29.639 --> 00:29:33.749
the same time I don't think anybody

00:29:30.899 --> 00:29:35.820
actually hates Guy Fieri they just sort

00:29:33.749 --> 00:29:38.669
of like make fun of them in a way that's

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.239
not always good natured and I can relate

00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:42.899
to that

00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:45.570
I think being Guy Fieri is like a dream

00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:49.320
job because the other chefs on like the

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:50.909
Food Network they got to cook things and

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.799
I don't I don't expect I don't

00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:55.259
understand the Food Network that like

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:57.119
you can just get recipes online I

00:29:55.259 --> 00:29:59.759
understand it like this food based game

00:29:57.119 --> 00:30:02.759
shows chops used to watch a lot of chops

00:29:59.759 --> 00:30:06.629
not my favorite anymore but I just got

00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:09.239
over the gimmick I guess but being Guy

00:30:06.629 --> 00:30:11.549
Fieri is actually like if I could be

00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:14.570
reincarnated as like the next Guy Fieri

00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:14.570
I think I'd be stoked

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:21.509
seems like a happy dude who does it like

00:30:18.779 --> 00:30:23.580
the greatest job on earth there is a

00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:25.590
Canadian version this is not a joke

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.429
there's a Canadian version of diners

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.100
drive-ins and dives

00:30:26.429 --> 00:30:34.739
it copies the exact same formula except

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:37.409
the host is a not Super Saiyan and it's

00:30:34.739 --> 00:30:40.139
called you gotta eat here so what he you

00:30:37.409 --> 00:30:42.059
know probably gets trained around Canada

00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:43.590
on via one that's quite first-class

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:45.989
airplane but you know this will give you

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:49.200
free wine from time to time and then he

00:30:45.989 --> 00:30:51.239
goes this is the you know Ottawa gettin

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.009
those finest poutine arre and he goes oh

00:30:51.239 --> 00:30:56.550
this whole it's just melt in your mouth

00:30:53.009 --> 00:30:58.230
real cheese curds you know also a pretty

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.700
a job but I don't know how long you got

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.460
it you here has got left in it

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.950
it might go on forever it might not make

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:08.160
it there really is like the Canadian

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:09.630
trope of copying an American TV show and

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.030
then getting of giving it a different

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.440
name much like the American trope of

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:16.050
copying a British TV show and then

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.210
giving it a different name or the same

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:20.280
name in the case of Kitchen Nightmares

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.870
or big brother which I think was

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:26.070
actually originally Dutch but anyway

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:28.500
don't say that to Dan Keesling then

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:36.900
again Big Brother in Canada was called

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:38.790
Big Brother Canada so yeah I think being

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.350
like a Food Network taster is the ideal

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:42.450
job I don't even like I don't want to be

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:45.660
on chopped on chopped it's always like

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:48.090
you know we've made these uh food truck

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.070
chefs make you a meal with a roof

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.870
shingle and a bunch of carpenters glue

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.760
and then they eat it and go like moon

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.170
well dude I really like how you hit the

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.600
carpenters glue under the saffron

00:31:55.170 --> 00:32:00.900
reduction Guy Fieri gets to eat meals

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:03.450
where like the restaurants next to a

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.040
butter factory and they're like oh yeah

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:11.400
we just get our butter from the butter

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:13.860
factory Neil Hall it's a dream job all

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:18.900
he does is eat good food and say that

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:20.310
it's good it's a dream come true and

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.780
even if he doesn't like you just needs

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.120
one bite and they're like okay on to the

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:29.640
next take you don't see you in Asheville

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:31.440
I do wonder though now that there's like

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.040
thirty four seasons of diners drive-ins

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.300
and dives

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.890
do you think they must have at this

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:38.360
point I've had restaurants they went to

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:38.360
and they're like not very good

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.020
it must have happened I refuse to

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:46.179
believe that they've exclusively knocked

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.620
it out of the park anyway you know let's

00:32:46.179 --> 00:32:53.250
watch the ending again it's been a while

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:56.080

00:32:53.250 --> 00:33:04.780
