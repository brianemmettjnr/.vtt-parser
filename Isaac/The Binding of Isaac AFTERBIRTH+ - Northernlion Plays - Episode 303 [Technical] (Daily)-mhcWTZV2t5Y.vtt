##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.500
everybody welcome back to know the land

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.730
please inviting Rasgotra plus our we did

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.529
really well yesterday on our daily

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
became 29th the court and agree but that

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.450
daily is in the books 0.36 percentile

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.580
overall a very very good score today's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.360
daily is my kind of daily but you're not

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.920
going to like that

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960
because it is Anna's asel run that goes

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.600
to mega Satan

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.130
I've got you know compared to the norm I

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.510
think I have more Azazel experience

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.050
because we've done so many Azazel runs

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.790
to like fill time on the NL SS that I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.829
think we're fairly robust when it comes

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.809
to our Azazel skill set now to be fair

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.879
Anna's angel run in which you're forced

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.170
to fight for points at least you're

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.309
forced to fight Hoss you're forced to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.700
fight

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.550
boss rush it can incur problems due to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.530
the the range issue that is asel

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.030
obviously has but you know I mean even

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.129
just getting a little brim right off the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.989
bat does a lot to to kind of sort that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.760
out so I'm pretty unconcerned to you but

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.670
yeah I mean in a way this is again my

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.530
ideal for ranking purposes it's like my

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.470
ideal daily because all you got to do is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.810
play as well as possible and as well

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.110
just means like mechanically I'm not

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.010
saying on the best player mechanically

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.350
isn't it I can't remember this is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.180
actually it tears downgrade or not tears

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.180
the range downgraded Azazel but can't

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.159
open that it seems like a range upgrade

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
not by much but but by a little bit at

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.820
least I'm going to open the golden chest

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.680
as well I'm not saying I'm mechanically

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.420
the best Isak player in the world

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.549
because that would just be a lie

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.229
it's the probably the best word they

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.630
used to describe it but for whatever

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.340
reason my my Azazel playing probably

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.619
just due to you know law of large

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.280
numbers has turned out pretty well for

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.780
the most part so I'm feeling like we're

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.909
we're well equipped to do fine today so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.939
we're going to peep potential secret

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.840
room I'm stunned actually stunned that

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.409
that's not our secret room it could be

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.409
here

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.770
kind of a lesser likely position but we

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.060
got it nonetheless we also got a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.560
strength card which is good for deal to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.840
devil purposes we don't need hang demand

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.390
and we don't necessarily need the full

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.730
card try for a second secret room we got

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.890
lucky and found it on the first glance

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.730
here and sure I mean a range upgrade you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.040
know no originally I was down with that

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.300
but I think the range upgrade is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.500
actually worth more the poisons worth

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.820
something it's not worth a lot we

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.470
belabor at that point you know for

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.390
hundreds of episodes how important is it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.459
that poison when you get it is it is it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.080
a C+ is it an A - is it a D I don't know

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.050
it's a little bit of a tough call here

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.480
so I'm going to do what I do best and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.420
we'll delay that decision until it

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.910
becomes immediately pressing and more

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.390
apparent because on the one hand getting

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.430
five extra bombs is okay it's worth

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.170
something we could use the bombs it's

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.830
not just for points like those bombs

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.870
could have a purpose and then ghost

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.940
pepper is good but I actually don't know

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.930
if it works as is hazel if it works it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.400
might be amazing take blood clot try to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.560
take advantage of the strength card not

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.800
on this floor that was just a god-awful

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.390
way to take a little damage obviously

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.250
Krampus his head is like completely fine

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.630
and that is indeed what showed up we

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.150
took a little bit of damage but I

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:32.500
wouldn't I wouldn't sweat it just yet I

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:35.290
wouldn't sweat it just yet it okay no

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.820
secret rooms there now we have no bombs

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.290
but I shouldn't really let that

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.549
influence my decision especially because

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.830
I was going to say we're probably going

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.290
to get some right here the Sun card you

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:49.209
just I think you should use it as a as a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.760
map if you needed but probably more

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.100
pressingly just to you know kill some of

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.540
the enemies on this room like the Sun

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.540
should just kill that enemy and then

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.859
grandpa's head didn't quite get the job

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.900
and to be honest with you we don't

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.400
really need Krampus head we're still

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.170
doing enough damage like with brimstone

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.849
that we have very few concerns in a

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.120
department we've got an ample of cards

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.650
Lee Street found our secret room because

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.870
we have money but we can't access our

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.880
shop I think we are going to take the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.220
bombs and this might be like a grossly

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.079
incorrect decision but I'm going to take

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.400
the bombs and I'm going to use the bombs

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.599
to finance secret room access we got two

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.919
sacks give us a hero font card which we

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.080
shouldn't maybe use because we can find

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.509
blank card later hangman card gives us

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.070
nothing and then we're basically out but

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.240
we can still look for a second secret

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.610
room and what's nice is that there's

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.750
really only one plausible location for

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.940
the second secret room and that's right

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:50.060
up here we're looking for like bombs our

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.539
key health up that's a health up plus a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.830
health down question marks pheromones

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.570
bombs are key we wanted bombs or key so

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.930
actually like this might all be coming

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.669
together

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.220
let me get bomb bag which i think is

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.070
worth picking up and Sackboy dude I

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.449
think we actually by the skin of our

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.590
teeth pulled that one out and we might

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.630
even be able to get a little bit more

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.370
money out of this situation as well keep

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.889
our deal with the devil chance alive so

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.419
or I keep our blood bank chance alive

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.949
and then I think you take the health

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.010
down pill and we're using that basically

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.960
as a strength card more or less to give

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.000
us more HP but it's a little bit more

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.039
flexible because we can use it to get HP

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.349
even if we don't get a deal with the

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.919
devil out of it immediately so okay five

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.630
more bombs for all the damage we took

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.880
there I actually think we we sort of

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.070
held it together and and made a positive

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.930
thing happen there which is nice so we

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.430
will you know take our damage you got to

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.000
take your lumps in the situation and

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.490
that's completely fine I think although

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.870
it's always you know on your minds

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.250
George Jones style to potentially use

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.680
Krampus as head against the boss if we

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.120
use it on any room that seems to warrant

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.169
it I think we're going to buy ourselves

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.780
so much time when it comes to to

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.220
handling boss rush it should be a little

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.419
bit easier to get there at least and

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.400
then of course you know it's not just

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.060
boss rush you gotta make the hush fight

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.060
as well so

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.630
decent reasoning I think so that red and

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.830
white pill is just question marks we

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.780
should be aware of that for the future

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:24.440
to full run reroll normally I don't do

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.110
this on dailies anymore but there are

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.610
some situations in which it sort of

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.390
makes sense you know a fine okay you

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:35.150
know I'll go this way then Mongo baby is

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.740
like okay it does not do a little

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.630
brimstone effect which is a bummer but

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.790
that's okay I don't think I'm gonna do

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.580
it on today's daily cuz it just looks

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.470
great already so it seems like kind of a

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.890
an unnecessary risk

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.770
for me Wow

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.600
it ended up giving us a secret room kind

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.130
of a surprise I think it seems like an

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.230
unnecessary risk right now where we're

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.260
going semillas heck as zany as we can

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.880
get in the in the non dailies we're

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.380
rolling into I mean if those episodes

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.360
haven't come out yet we're rolling into

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.340
garbage we're rolling from like a house

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.770
on the Hollywood Hills into like you

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.480
know a Love Shack at the side of the

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:16.490
road and players on known battlegrounds

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.680
so I don't feel like we're at a

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:23.450
detriment from the same department right

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:26.300
now the Department of Zane um so you

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:31.580
take diplopia and one way to use this is

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:34.340
obviously to get deal with the devil

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.410
doubles for free or you could use it to

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.940
get a bunch of boss rush items for free

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:43.270
but I'm just going to use it you know as

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:45.740
is right now what you take PhD first

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.420
she's going to give us a pill the pill

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.490
is act down pills em again and I'm

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.660
drowsy pill which is okay whatever and

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.040
the health down pill becomes a health

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:57.590
uphill so we can rock something else

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:59.030
here and then we kind of maybe just pump

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.890
out Ace of Diamonds right now and turn

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.240
everything else into pennies and you can

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:07.970
buy a PhD which will give you another

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.160
will give you another good pill but I

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.230
think we'll just go like moms moms nun's

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.630
habit instead well who do you think you

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.230
know the nun is obviously it's mom but

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.790
that's just a theory a game theory

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.770
husaria sneeze every time I mention game

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.620
theory

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:31.210
so weird park I have and by perk I mean

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:33.460
disease no um anyway I think we made

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.840
right ish decisions there we still have

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.640
the strength cars and it's you know it's

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.200
still sort of provides us with a benefit

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.670
phd's nice nuns habits nice and we still

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.310
got enough money to maybe get an arcade

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:48.010
on the next floor so I ain't sweating it

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.870
very much at all here secret room oh

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:53.340
come on as not a secret room we've

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:57.100
already been in a secret room you dummy

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.450
second secret room is not then and we're

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.640
missing one room here but I think that's

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.580
an acceptable cost or rather I should

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.330
say I think it's unacceptable for us to

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.680
go back to try to do one room just to

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.650
get the exploration bonus and whatever

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.720
well else we might get out of that room

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.830
so we are looking at potential deals

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.270
with the angel coming up here and I'm

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.010
excited about that adds a little bit of

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.450
Zain into this run the top score today

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.590
is in like the 60s and if you want to

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.080
get front page you've got to be in the

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:25.690
50s which to me basically means you just

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:29.230
have to play really really well and if

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:31.900
you can you know get a blank card that

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:35.860
were otherwise like break the run with

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:37.630
with some kind of breaking engine you

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.570
know like I mean this is not really the

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:43.570
most eloquent way to explain it but to

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.520
have cursed dice or something like that

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.560
cracked dice and be able to make that

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.840
pop off and one of the many mercurial

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.250
ways in which you do and I say you

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.600
they're not as the Royal you because

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.970
obviously I don't know what I'm doing

00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:00.150
when it comes today counterfeit any

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:05.530
interesting you know worth something

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:07.180
but these clubs cherry I'm just going to

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.700
pop some of these to get them out of the

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.070
way um I don't really want to lose

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.270
tapeworm I like having the extra ranges

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.490
Azazel and I think it's going to lead to

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.980
us taking less damage you might be

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.650
saying hey moron you rear old your

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:24.160
strength card into a bomb yeah no I know

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:27.400
I think that's a decent idea here I

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.990
think that's a secret room no I think

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.490
it's a decent idea here I don't think a

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.810
strength card is worth very much right

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.810
now when we've got three HP

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:41.910
sacks are keeping us like in a great

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.910
spot here just don't take too too long

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.780
we still are ahead of schedule for boss

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.120
rush but not by a ton at least not

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.370
necessarily okay you hear me out here

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.990
again this is like it's not four points

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.940
but this is a play I probably would not

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.010
make on a daily around a non daily I

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.330
should say we're going to turn needless

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:03.010
consumables into four keys and we're

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:06.850
going to keep our permit cards in order

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:08.770
to do that and save a little bit of

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.620
money sure having seven cents will take

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.090
poke a go throw this down here we don't

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.280
need the box of trinkets it's not

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.910
necessarily bad but we definitely do not

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.880
need it

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:20.880
same thing with Mama mega I know there's

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.040
a car there that might be useful but

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.080
buddy in a box like is it that good I

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.120
don't think it's that good ventricular

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.950
razors got some value to we're looking

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.510
for something a little bit better like

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:34.000
converter doesn't do it for us either

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.620
here okay I mean there's always valuing

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.910
swallow penny and dull razor can be

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.980
interesting but I think yeah jumper

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.710
cables is fine so the more enemies you

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:44.740
kill the more this will get charged up

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:47.440
and I'm always happy to see foreveralone

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.640
unless we need like a game-winning item

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.160
instantly I'm always happy to see

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.290
forever alone so let's just keep it

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.520
moving here you're in a good spot you

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.890
know this is probably going to lead to

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.410
the the boss I'll take our eternal heart

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.820
it doesn't necessarily mean we can't do

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:07.030
an arcade on this floor I mean we've got

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:09.070
the HP to take whatever we want or you

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.410
know the phrase it like live Tyler in

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:14.940
the Lord of the Rings films if you want

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:19.480
it come and claim it to phrase it like

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:20.370
Madonna from we don't need it we just

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.400
don't need it

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:27.670
Madonna from our music song / video four

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.090
minutes to save the world if you want it

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:33.280
you already got it it's actually like

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:36.420
almost on pitch which is about as good

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.650
as it gets for northern line singing so

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:42.050
true story

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:44.300
an ex-girlfriend of mine and I wouldn't

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:47.360
say we had a fight but had sort of like

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.570
a little bit of an argument she had good

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.980
taste actually but one day she showed me

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.810
four minutes by Madonna and she was like

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.640
check it out it's like this is one of

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.050
the best songs I've ever heard in my

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.180
life and I listened to it I was like it

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.160
was alright I don't think it's that

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.450
amazing I don't think it's garbage well

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.770
like is that amazing she was like you

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.050
are you really like you're being serious

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:08.540
you don't appreciate the the artistry of

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.800
this I don't know why that was the you

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.140
know everybody gets that so sometimes

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.150
I'm like you know hey you know Creed

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.010
stinks in my opinion if what you as

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.770
always entitled us whatever you want to

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.960
listen to bothers me little judge me not

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.250
by my top ten albums of all time judging

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.080
by the way that I treat other people in

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.740
public and yell at them for you know

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.700
going to the deli counter etc etc but

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.670
happier with the fool car just in case

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.800
we need it you know I'll be like I don't

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:36.020
really like Creed but I sort of think

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.800
that my own prison is actually like an 8

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.150
out of 10

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.710
despite the fact that it's a little

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.340
ridiculous people go NL you're out of

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.570
your mind that's know and you're

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.760
probably right but for whatever reason

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.140
that song like can warm its way into my

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.730
brain even though I recognize that it

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:54.410
might be bad and you know definitely for

00:13:52.730 --> 00:14:03.950
whatever reason for minutes did that to

00:13:54.410 --> 00:14:05.750
her but I digress Joker card well um I

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.160
mean we're probably going to get a deal

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.440
with the devil anyways the thing so I

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.240
think you actually you can be smart here

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.390
though because this is not the this is

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.340
not deaf students Necropolis 1-0 a

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.710
tattoo ain't bad we got the guys pop it

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:22.820
just for the HP yeah Emperor

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:25.190
we got tamper amps damper rains okay so

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.300
here's what you do know I mean we're net

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.470
we're going to lose the temperance card

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.630
and I think I'm ok with that

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:34.430
use the emperor card to bounce out of

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:36.080
here god I hate fighting brownie it's

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.910
like the new Big Horn like this guy

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.730
shows up on every freaking run lately

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.380
and I hate him but take this we got a

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.360
deal with the devil I guess I'm not

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.090
bummed if we get good stuff and we

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.610
really did get good stuff so goodbye

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.830
Krampus is head why did I do this well I

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:54.770
wanted to save the half spirit hard for

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.630
you know going out into the through the

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.810
spikes we lose a temperance card as a

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:02.090
result which might cost us a little bit

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.560
more but I don't know you know we've

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.910
been doing a lot of daily so I've been

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.320
having a lot of fun with them lately but

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.030
I'm trying new things as well even if

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.690
the new things are as mundane as like

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:14.960
you know let's handle this this way oh

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:18.860
dude you use two of clubs and then you

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:21.800
use ancient recall I thought that would

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.150
give us the three most recent cards we

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.100
used maybe I'm an idiot

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.180
but still I mean we got gotten a lot of

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:31.560
bombs out of it we already used our key

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.280
we already used our key we didn't get a

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.570
[Music]

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.400
blank card so I feel like we're kind of

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.660
free to use some of this stuff we're

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.550
keeping the Emperor card it's basically

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.430
like a fail-safe if for some reason it

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.620
seems like we're not going to make it to

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:49.850
the boss fight to boss rush I should say

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:51.050
I think like because we have sackboy we

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.320
should have a pretty good shot of just

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.580
getting enough consumables to make this

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.410
happen regardless actually you know what

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.700
we definitely want the Joker card just

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.870
in case we don't get a deal with the

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.330
devil on the next floor and we got a

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.230
little bit of time to explore you I

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:08.360
certainly at least enough to get to the

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:10.520
item room I didn't really think that

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.170
jumper cables guppies head was going to

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.090
be that good but it seems like it's

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:19.040
largely getting the job done here if I'm

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:20.810
being honest with you I don't know if we

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.220
even want the HP at this point we do

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:26.270
have deal with the devil precedent but

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:29.300
okay okay so guess we'll take it as a

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:31.280
sign say hey pretty and then will you

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.560

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.580
be at your beck encounter on Michael

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.780
Montgomery anybody anybody Chad Michael

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.560
Murray anybody Jonathan Taylor Thomas

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:44.120
anybody Neil Patrick Harris anybody I'm

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.740
trying to think of people as quickly as

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:51.140
possible that have three first names

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:52.220
oh well Jonathan Taylor Thomas yeah

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.110
three first names

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:58.160
Jonathan Tim the Toolman Taylor Thomas

00:16:54.110 --> 00:17:00.670
six first names maybe we shouldn't have

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.670
taken that

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.429
Neil Patrick Harris Neil absolutely

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:09.559
Patrick I think we should have taken

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:14.030
that because it's making our range like

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:15.559
a lot better Harris now it's almost like

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.870

name but I'd be like you know what it's

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.660
a rare first name it's rare enough that

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.780

so we got like a lot of every consumable

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.419
points-wise we're in a great spot we're

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:26.570
in a great spot and our rank is all the

00:18:20.419 --> 00:18:29.210
way up there what are we looking for

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.830
well this floor is very simple first off

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:34.040
Yuri roll the whole run no I'm not going

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:37.370
to deal with I'm in a good spot and the

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:41.630
siren song of the day I didn't get hit

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:46.250
there the siren song of the v6 room

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:48.200
cannot sway me not today I think about

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.720
that sometimes because Kate and I we

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.760
know we're not in the next stage of our

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.580
lives but we're approaching the next

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:59.179
stage of our lives you know we are

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.290
probably going to have kids one day I've

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:02.900
never really been the kind of person

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.640
who's like I'm never gonna have kids but

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.840
when I was 17 I was like I'm never going

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.260
to have kids in the back of my head it

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.300
was like

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.070
say that cuz no a good no I'm going to

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.720
test you on it they're going to be like

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.240
oh really how strongly do you feel about

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.590
it person who just learned how to do

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.850
derivatives you know you're still in the

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.980
infancy of your life it's called the

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:21.380
derivative scales I always said so

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.930
probably like within the next five years

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.050
or so probably going to have that

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:29.570
conversation so I kind of think like

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:31.730
it's worth a key for certain I got to

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.440
think like where am I going to name what

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.800
am I going to suggest at least as a name

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:42.620
for a daughter or a son I think I'm a

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:44.360
very traditional name guy like a Ryan

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.830
jr. not going to happen that's just

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:51.770
you're asking for trouble I don't think

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:59.930
we want any of this really Rico where

00:19:51.770 --> 00:20:03.050
you going buddy you got to poop and I

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:06.140
don't like there's no I'm not going to

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:08.060
name my kid like Michael first off it's

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.430
a little played out at this point plus I

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.960
know too many Michael's and it would be

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.520
like an awkward situations like what

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.050
Michael did you name it after that I

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.730
didn't really name it after anybody to

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.170
sort of like the name yeah but isn't it

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.490
weird that like one of your best friends

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.690
is named Michael as well and I bet yeah

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:25.100
you know I came to thats a little weird

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:28.400
but then like once you get up so

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:31.970
everyone's like I don't want a boring

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.650
name but then it becomes complicated if

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.890
you if you don't want a boring name but

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.810
you also don't want an out-there name

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:41.210
like I don't want to name my kid like

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.820
blacks on or something like that you

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:47.020
know I mean that's I don't wanna be like

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.850
Nicolas Cage II named his son kal-el

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.320
that's that's treating your child as if

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.630
it's something that you own which I mean

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.300
like you sort of do for a while at least

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:59.060
I mean you don't you know have a baby

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:02.630
you are in ownership of a baby I think

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.670
as a on a colloquial level obviously on

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:07.400
a legal level it's an individual but you

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:09.620
know what I mean like you have this this

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.870
house has it comes with a baby is what

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.220
I'm trying to say yeah let's just go

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.720
through with this we didn't go to our

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.290
shop oh we did go to our shop and I'm

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.350
completely okay if we had not

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.210
or shop anyway if you name your kid like

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.820
you know Wolverine or something like

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:27.270
that that's just again not trying to

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:29.810
insult anybody but it's too far it's too

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:32.550
far for me to feel comfortable with

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:34.080
might as well take this take the Polar

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.030
gold-digger negative as well as what I

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.520
mean so take the negative tonight for an

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:42.180
Ambika Tuesday I will okay

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:50.600
yeah pyromaniac that's pretty great beat

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:53.700
the pants off a kidney stone just gotta

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:58.110
play this right we got here faster than

00:21:53.700 --> 00:22:01.500
usual we should make the hush fight

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:03.390
pretty easily I don't know why you get

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:09.330
two charges from each room of boss rush

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:13.230
now certainly not complaining but you

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.610
know just pointing that out there I'm

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.170
very happy about it's like you get a

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:19.910
charge when the room ends and when it

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:22.410
starts it's the classic off by one error

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.320
you're doing a pre-increment at a

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:27.390
post-increment what are you thinking

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.640
dude points wise we're in a really nice

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.430
spot right now not sure if you noticed

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.690
that but yeah you know you're probably

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.280
again now you're not talking about the

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.440
name thing anyways because I think the

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.170
bits kind of played out I guess but like

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:45.330
to the same token I'm just sort of like

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:46.140
I don't know if you go for her name is

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.210
too boring

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:53.010
I guess I'd rather err on the side of

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:56.900
too boring than like two out there like

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:59.790
if inside there like Dave or it's like

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.260
you know a name with a number sign in it

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:05.300
or something like that I guess I'll go

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:07.500
for Dave I don't see a child's name

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.660
necessarily as like an extension of the

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.270
adults personality I think that's that's

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.800
where I get a little annoyed or at least

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.110
I mean it's not like it's my business at

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.580
all but if you're like yeah I really

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:21.360
like sandwiches so my daughter's name

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.860
panini and I'm like well you know what

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.060
if she hates sandwiches you know you've

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.090
given there you haven't given her a

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.399
tabula rasa you've given her a you've

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:33.509
given her a sandwich press

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:36.460
until one penny me of Killip amino I

00:23:33.509 --> 00:23:40.509
actually ordered a I ordered a panini

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.889
today because I'm fancy and at the at

00:23:40.509 --> 00:23:44.259
the cafe where I ordered it it was

00:23:41.889 --> 00:23:45.429
called a panino and I was internally I

00:23:44.259 --> 00:23:47.259
was like I'm not going to do that I said

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:49.450
all the turkey panini and they you know

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:53.109
what didn't say anything cuz I'm a

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:56.049
paying customer actually it's called a

00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:59.849
penny no or do you want more than one no

00:23:56.049 --> 00:24:03.309
I'll take it's okay we call it a panini

00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:04.929
we've turned the Italian word for press

00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:06.909
sandwich into an English word for press

00:24:04.929 --> 00:24:08.200
sandwich that's very similar as far as

00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:14.440
I'm concerned that's the way that's the

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:16.960
way she goes right now couldn't afford

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.509
Panera so she named her dotty her Daffy

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.229
her daughter panini tell me that ain't

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:22.229
in Sukkur

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:32.730
got more for me into Sicily like a

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:34.980
ridiculous amount of Guppies head

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.840
charges so we're not crushing it and we

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:41.820
are taking a little bit of damage so I'm

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:45.230
feeling the burn a little keep in mind

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:47.250
we are getting another item here as well

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.980
by the way you might be looking at this

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:52.020
and going dude my reflection screwed you

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.130
I actually do not think it did I think

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.130
it benefits us

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:08.280
like the bend is bad but it came with

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:10.890
the benefit of like such increased range

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:15.180
then I'm inclined to be like completely

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:16.740
okay with it but our damage set is

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.260
pretty bad a rate of fire is not

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.520
necessarily killing it so we could speed

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.660
up but I think we've got the tools

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:26.430
necessary to beat the hush fight in our

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.590
even in our current state obviously you

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:31.620
know in the back end the front of my

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:33.660
head and both of the sides I'm thinking

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:43.140
about the gappi dreams I want the guppy

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:45.600
dream to come to fruition here and if it

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:49.110
does grapes if it doesn't less great but

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.250
still probably fine for now well it was

00:25:49.110 --> 00:26:00.760
fast

00:25:51.250 --> 00:26:02.470
oh the worst decamp pitch not a huge

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.510
deal but I didn't walk right into that

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.350
damage so I mean dark bomb would be a

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.059
great pickup

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.200
we need offense more than defense but I

00:26:07.059 --> 00:26:13.360
mean look at all the red hearts down

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:15.539
here right regular pin actually stands

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.539
no chance

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.750
yeah

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:31.940
come on come on you got to be careful

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.170
with the name bits mangas you never know

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.580
who's gonna be watching this and they're

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.690
gonna be like you know I'm subscribed

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:40.040
you for eight years

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:41.480
my name is you know backs on what do you

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.220
got against the names axon it's a

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:47.180
perfectly craw Mueller name and I don't

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:50.150
mean like any time you know you're

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:52.880
making a joke that oh is this maybe

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:55.040
Beelzebub know the guppy item doesn't

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.690
count okay you make it a joke that might

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.880
be if someone's expense you got it you

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.100
got to recognize I think the nature of

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.260
humor is that you can't make a joke with

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:06.260
nobodies the butt of the joke there's

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:09.260
always potentially going to be people

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:11.900
that could take offense because a lot of

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:14.090
humor is making fun of something now

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.890
some people go in one direction there

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.660
and they go well in that case it's

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:20.060
impossible to make humor that never

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:21.740
offends anybody so like you know I'm not

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.860
even going to try you know in the seal

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.810
it was funny to think about abortion is

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:29.090
you know and that's it that was not a

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:32.540
dig at Luiz ek at all whoo I think it's

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:34.310
a fantastic comedian and he has a

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.350
prominent abortion bit in one of his

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.640
recent specials but then there's the

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.800
other side of things like the Mike

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.150
Birbiglia side of things where you know

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.370
you try to make fun of people but make

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:45.410
it as good-natured as possible

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.270
I think there's space for both and I try

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.070
to be more on the good-natured side even

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.560
when I go on like a ridiculous bit about

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.390
like not that I'm a comedian to begin

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.680
with but you go on a ridiculous bit

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.800
about you know the people at the deli

00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:00.560
counter try never to go like those

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.980
people should be slaughtered it always

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.440
comes back to you know you're the jerk

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:09.010
for making the judgment in the first

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.420
place and that's I think that it helps

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:14.000
everybody feel good because you're

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.800
laughing at people and then you're

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.750
laughing at me as long as it ends with

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.300
the laughing at me I think everybody is

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.490
as many people as possible leave with a

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.610
smile on their faces that's just my

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.980
personal philosophy so we got this Joker

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.620
card

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:33.279
and I'm I mean I'm tempted to use that

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:36.399
to be honest with you but we got to go

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:38.260
fast but the perthro rune is also

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:40.330
valuable so I'm going to do something

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.279
that's a little this is not mid

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:46.480
magazines it's the opposite I'm going to

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:48.580
Joker card right away the idea is I mean

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.169
that's obviously great and the idea is

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.580
it would be for the best if we don't get

00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:52.870
a deal with the devil here but if we do

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.669
at least we can use the peripheral rune

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.049
to re-roll something we don't like

00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:58.029
but the peripheral rune is more

00:28:56.049 --> 00:28:59.529
something I've got around right now at

00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:04.990
least from my perspective for the

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:07.289
purposes of like ace of clubs world's

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.370
card also great for the next floor but

00:29:07.289 --> 00:29:11.380
it's something I've got around here

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:16.029
mostly to like give us a chance to

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:17.380
really pop off you know we find actually

00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:21.429
a deal with the devil is like a great

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:22.600
opportunity to use the per throw room

00:29:21.429 --> 00:29:24.220
because we could maximize our copy

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.630
chances as well but yeah you maybe just

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.130
go a little faster here to begin with I

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.990
think you stick with perthro we I know

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:31.210
we have an emperor card but I think

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.649
that's taken a little bit too much of

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.139
the easy way out but you said is he

00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:37.539
bombs his way through this room but you

00:29:35.139 --> 00:29:39.899
maybe maybe get the idea there what I'm

00:29:37.539 --> 00:29:41.679
trying to get at nice dodge nice dodge

00:29:39.899 --> 00:29:43.539
okay we're gonna have two and a half

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:48.760
minutes roughly on the next floor not a

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:49.779
ton of time we did get a deal we're

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.570
going to re-roll because we're looking

00:29:49.779 --> 00:29:58.000
for Gumby items it's not it does it

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:59.529
doesn't really give us anything so you

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.539
know I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a

00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:03.309
play here I'm going to go back and yeah

00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:04.419
he's gonna cost us a bomb but it's gonna

00:30:03.309 --> 00:30:06.490
cause it's too fast early I'm going to

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:09.309
go back and get the Emperor card because

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:10.510
I don't want to miss the hush pipe even

00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:12.220
when I dream of you the sweetest dream

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.730
is just never do and I'd miss you baby

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:17.649
and I don't want to miss out on those

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:21.519
10,000 points or whatever we get plus

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:26.280
the shop dude we have 93 cents it would

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:29.520
be nice to get to oh yeah

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:33.120
would be nice to get to the shop down

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:40.980
there I don't know if this is like at

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:48.480
all worth our time but we're doing big

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:50.010
damage so I like when we have three

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.690
brimstone lasers shooting out

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:55.140
simultaneously I think that's very good

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:59.100
for us it's good for my morale so when

00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:01.440
do we pop the teleport card it's a tough

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.840
call to some extent not that it matters

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.420
too too much but it is it's a bit of a

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.250
tough call I would say probably around

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.960
29 minutes just to be on the safe side

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.030
because it wouldn't be the worst thing

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.220
to save the emperor card is the thing

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:20.670
like we could get value out of saving

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:22.800
the emperor card you know get to the

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.600
Cathedral fight a little faster just in

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:30.150
case our HP is bad after the hush fight

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:31.890
for example but so there is value in

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:34.020
keeping it as what I was trying to get

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:37.080
at there is there value in using it

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:39.330
early not really at this point small

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:44.510
rock is very very nice even with the

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.510
speed downgrade I'm more than content

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.350
got to keep those battery charges and

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:53.450
the money is just like I mean I'd like

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.450
some luck upgrades but money's money

00:31:55.530 --> 00:32:02.550
get a little ridiculous here de Guise

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.770
okay what's the other card hangman you

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.030
know what see you later boys oh that's a

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.750
hangman I meant to use the ampere see

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.790
you later boys

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.140
we're probably we were probably going in

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.610
the right direction but it was it was a

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.070
little further away I might have found

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:24.630
myself in a trickier spot I might still

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:26.220
find myself in a tricky spot good fight

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.200
honestly we can't fight Krampus so we

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.480
might as well keep this it's got the

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.190
item you got I mean that's the thing is

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.420
going to put us in a slightly dicey your

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.980
position but you got to take contra head

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.680
from below it's a beautiful it's a

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:40.440
beautiful item for dailies so we do need

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:48.270
a little HP the the hush fight is not

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:53.730
going to be easy necessarily certainly

00:32:48.270 --> 00:33:00.060
pay for itself to open those chests fool

00:32:53.730 --> 00:33:02.430
card is not worth much it's this is a

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.350
surprisingly tough decision and it's

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.060
because the invincibility is really

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.030
really nice especially on dailies but

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:13.440
the purity bonus from the aura can also

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:16.470
be very very useful I feel like you

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:20.250
might as well spend like 10 cents here

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:22.230
or even 15 that probably didn't matter

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.220
but you know there's money out here is

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.510
what I'm getting at and even if there

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.920
weren't there would be money that we

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:29.880
could get later that would fill this gap

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:32.250
so I mean in here it's a little bit of

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.200
an easier choice tech point 5 is a lot

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.540
better than triple shot I think if we're

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.220
charging shots especially and if our

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.500
rate of fire is an amazing health

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.150
upgrade we can maybe take it after Telep

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.550
hills doesn't matter walking on sunshine

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.090
is temporary invincibility it's worth

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.130
something

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:49.890
ok so we're taking faiths reward well

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:51.060
what do you go here I think I'm going to

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.710
go for the purity bonus because it's

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.600
more fun and rate right away

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.010
big range upgrade which is probably the

00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:00.110
most valuable upgrade we can get right

00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:00.110
now as Azazel anyway so

00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:09.240
the dangerous part is that we really are

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:11.879
better off standing still because this

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:15.450
thing the lasers got a heck of a bend to

00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:18.409
it you know and the bend is dependent on

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:23.429
the moves that we've most recently made

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:25.500
luckily you know we got a little brim

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:28.730
and then we got an even littler brim in

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:34.679
the form of Incubus

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:36.030
so we're hidden I guess the bigger

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:38.909
problem is we want to hit with

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:41.790
everything all at once and that's not

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:43.169
always plausible I'm glad we didn't

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.790
reroll this though not just because what

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:45.990
we've got right now is good but because

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.300
what we got right now is kind of cool

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:53.040
you know three different and and two

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:54.540
highly divergent brimstone lasers plus

00:34:53.040 --> 00:35:00.900
we got the tech laser as well which is

00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:03.060
also bending but might get a charge here

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:06.150
should get a charge it is like 15 flies

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.950
in that area so I mean the flies are

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:11.900
just going to be used to kill other

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:14.460
flies but I think we got the bonus

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:17.690
charge from jumper cables for the Flies

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:20.520
like going off the screen which is a

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:23.630
little strange but I'm not going to

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.630
complain at this point

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:33.260
okay that's fair how we doing points

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.850
wise I honestly have no idea I mean the

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:39.740
central premise of this daily is

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:42.540
basically it's pretty easy it's

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:46.530
basically a test of the fundamentals

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:51.540
like sure having three Brimstone's is

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:55.230
also pretty nice but it's mostly about

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:59.580
dodging were you able to get all the

00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:02.270
dodges off if you were you're probably

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.800
fine and remember we're not going at

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:08.490
we're not going to the Delirium fight so

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.740
this is actually like no stop with these

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.690
guys please this is actually like the

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:19.830
peak difficulty of this run right now it

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:21.480
should not get harder than this so is

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:28.340
fifty thousand within the realm of

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:32.220
possibility I would I would probably say

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.640
okay this guy's got to go dude he's dead

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.700
already

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.180
I pops feels like I'm walking on

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.040
sunshine

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.210
I guess I'm glad that it didn't go off

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.210
because we still have it but

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:50.610
are you just waiting for me to damage

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.790
you enough that you can do the laser

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:55.230
beam attack I don't know the a I

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.360
probably wasn't thinking about that

00:36:55.230 --> 00:37:09.450
given you know lack of sentience and all

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:14.700
that but so we are like a bit of a weird

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:16.950
spot like we have pyromaniac but we

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:19.890
can't heal because we don't have any red

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:21.180
hearts I think we did fine on the hush

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.850
fight not as well as we could have done

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.990
but fine get the fool we got held up the

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.400
songs that reminds us of good times with

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.700
songs our minds are the best eyes tell

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.080
appeals I mean the fool does nothing so

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.030
you might as well take like health up

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.500
bombs our key is not worth it I okay we

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:39.510
definitely want health up because

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:40.950
there's an internal heart somewhere so

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.910
we can take that and then we have to HP

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.170
and that's bad because we don't

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.640
impermanent polaroid invincibility but

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.690
it's good because now we can have two HP

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.050
which means we have a little bit of a

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:51.630
buffer in which we can use pyromaniac so

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:54.210
is there's a lot of value there actually

00:37:51.630 --> 00:38:03.230
I've become frozen in place I cannot

00:37:54.210 --> 00:38:03.230
move well

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:19.500
controller I can't move I can't move

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:22.560
I guess blowing myself up and the the

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:26.240
makeup table at the same time it's

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.240
caused a little bit of a conundrum here

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:36.560
if I exit though I'm pretty sure we just

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:36.560
like get a score of zero on the daily so

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:45.870
puts me in quite a weird spot doesn't it

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:48.420
I mean I can't I really the keyboard

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:49.860
works I just can't move my character I'm

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.600
clicking on the window you know I'm try

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.130
I tried to use the controller I really

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.370
think like I broke something in the in

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:58.140
the code by accidentally becoming a QA

00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:00.150
tester that's kind of an inch case so I

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.410
can understand it you blow something up

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:03.450
that also heals you

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.920
that also hurt you and it gives you four

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.400
pills and blah blah blah you get the

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.160
idea

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.380
plus there's like none on seven yeah

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.220
nuns have a charge that has to be no it

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.210
doesn't have to be count because we

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.430
didn't take damage but anyway you get

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:16.430
the idea I guess I'm going to exit I

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.730
mean I don't want to quit the daily but

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:25.530
I have no other options so you know I'm

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:28.290
a nihilist that's fine there's our score

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:30.180
it's really bad thanks for watching hope

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.740
you enjoyed the episode just salt it

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.270
forward maybe we've gotten a zero on it

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.250
but I'm not too worried about our rank

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.630
I'm more worried about being honest

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.160
about this situation I guess for now

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.450
thanks for watching this is super bummer

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.310
because I think we did have a chance at

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.900
certainly ranking a lot better than this

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.190
but for now thanks for watching if you

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.240
enjoyed it click the like button now set

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.200
a great deal of course subscribe if you

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.330
wanna see more in the future and I

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.100
apologize for the way it ended despite

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.900
it not really being my fault except for

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.220
throwing a lot of complicated actions of

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.500
the game at once for now thanks for

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.870
watching and I'll see you next time I

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:01.950
mean obviously the keyboard works cause

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:03.810
like I can do this but it just wasn't

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:06.770
working in the game very strange anyway

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.770
I'll see you next time
