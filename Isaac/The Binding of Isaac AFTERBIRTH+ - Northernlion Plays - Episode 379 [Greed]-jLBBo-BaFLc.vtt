00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.440
hey everybody welcome ignore the lamp

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.580
was minding my scattereth plus I

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.500
literally just got a tweet that was like

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.820
hey you should do greed mode runs and I

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.620
was just about to start Isaac and I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
thought you know what i should do green

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.590
mode runs um

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.439
let's I mean you have to do greed and

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.320
greedier as every character I think if I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.380
remember correctly greedier does not

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.609
counts as greed mode now I could be

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.369
wrong there but I don't think that I am

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.899
let's do an Isaac greed mode run you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
know what I'm trying to get at is that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.309
hard mode here's our seat by the way our

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.140
h7c yj2 a I don't mind a speed upgrade

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.460
although it's not my number one spot

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.410
like a Ludacris song if you do something

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960
on a hard mode it counts as you having

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.910
done it on normal mode as well Wow I am

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.780
a moron man but at least I even get hit

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.250
again after the original hit what do we

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.350
have in here let's take a let's take an

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.850
approach here first off we don't have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.830
the d6 how if I I've done so many Isaac

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.409
runs I didn't even realize we haven't

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.630
had the d6 unlocked as this guy it's a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.040
little absurd buddy in a box might be

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.509
worth picking up for seven cents but

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.790
with a reroll machine we usually like to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.290
go a little deeper we have a key that we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.860
can get we do have a key that we can get

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.979
in maybe a secret room no secret room

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.110
but a key and a penny for one bomb is a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.049
fair trade and okay juicy sack just okay

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.540
I don't like the concept of sticky

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.220
babies but yeah unless they're like

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.960
jelly babies it's like a real candy

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
right the jelly babies I don't know we

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.770
don't have those but sometimes I've

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.180
never seen them like in a box but

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310
sometimes I go to the grocery store and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.600
it's like you know organic jelly babies

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.810
and I'm like Whole Foods I'm not going

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.759
to pay fourteen dollars for the hundred

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.759
grams of jelly beans you know this is I

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.579
have more respect for myself and my bank

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.170
account than that that's ridiculous just

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.479
give me the glucose and the high

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.740
fructose corn syrup and I'll make them

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.950
myself I don't know how you

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:19.230
jellybeans let's be realistic here we're

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.030
one hit away from complete despair but

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.750
we have up to this point managed to do

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.250
okay

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.110
we basically I mean you know the deal

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.270
for greed mode right you want to survive

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.800
this first phase here get as much money

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:35.670
as possible and then buy something

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.260
meaningful from the shop that that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.090
actually gives you a good chance to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.530
succeed once you start buying HP you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.230
oftentimes kind of find yourself in a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.850
death spiral because you're spending

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.820
money that should be spent on making

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.330
your run stronger just surviving

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.230
temporarily so this is greed instead of

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.910
greedy earth I'm accustomed to greedy or

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.770
mode for what little greed I play I

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.200
played more greedy or mode at least

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.540
recently so greedy or mode for a while

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.580
was like actually hellish it was

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.480
horrible the balance was like completely

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.710
off in my opinion at least that they

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.560
fixed it and have you know led to some

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.140
improvements I don't know because body

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.780
in a box is okay sometimes you can get

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.440
some pretty decent stuff out of it and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.720
it's cheap but I think I'm going to try

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.950
to get a reroll and usually on this

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.410
reroll you could just go straight for

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.340
chaos chaos has given us the watch

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.540
battery which is really bad or super

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.850
magnet I forget what it's called

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.250
either way yeah watch batteries

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.070
different super magnet weirdly enough

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.440
was also a trinket that I had on my

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.750
first greed run we got to kill this guy

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.320
within the next 20 seconds I was also an

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.600
item that I had on my first greed run in

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.570
rebirth or if it was afterbirth that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.030
greed mode first came out in and I

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.770
remember because I took all the doors

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.110
that super greed had and they all like

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.760
honed in on me and I was so confused I

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.530
thought there was like some sort of a RG

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.120
was like if the doors are coming to us

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.470
what if we can get him to go through a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.280
door and come out of this other door

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.100
like a Benny Hill chase sequence so

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.480
we're not going to have 15 cents here

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.810
which means we kind of have

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.670
a strange situation for ourselves so we

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.860
can try to fight the deal with the devil

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.270
wave and just hope that we don't get hit

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.850
or at least don't get hit twice and die

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.640
a lot of bosses could probably hit us

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.410
once and kill us and that would save

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.850
some money or we could spend five cents

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.610
on a red heart that kind of guarantees

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.260
us a little bit more survival I don't

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.330
know I'm just going to I'm just going to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.560
hold off for now well we'll see what

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.080
happens after you kill this guy maybe

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.180
somehow he'll drop a consumable and you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.030
know we'll be happy campers but for now

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.580
[Music]

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.110
just play it cool

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.550
fairly okay start and chaos means

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.720
anything can happen it also means deals

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.370
with the devil are probably not as good

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.480
as they otherwise would be because they

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.020
could just contain items that are

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.190
garbage

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:16.910
no consumables huh I think I'm going to

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:21.540
buy a 3-cent heart just for my own

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.040
survival sake and even if we don't end

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.900
up needing it right now

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.980
you know it's an investment that we'll

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.390
need at some point in the future

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.940
probably unless we get a bunch of red

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.200
hearts that drop there are still some

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.060
deal with the devil items even with

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.040
chaos that I would be totally okay with

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.240
getting like basically if they're good

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:42.300
I'll take them I think that the like

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.940
Platonic ideal right now for a deal with

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.740
the devil with chaos is that we get on

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.920
all stats upgrade or at least something

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.210
that takes 1 hp and gives us 1 hp plus

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.910
something else basically just a

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.640
laundered stats upgrade like magic mush

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.040
meat trying to think of some other ones

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.190
HP plus lock in the form of magic scab

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.600
or something like that but kind of

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.460
feeling a little bit underpowered right

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.530
now we got a speed upgrade on the first

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.750
floor juicy sac is ok but without

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.970
amazing damage you know we're not really

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.360
thinning the the crowd too much on every

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.920
single wave here the first floor took us

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.970
like 6 minutes which is a little bit on

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.790
the long side and okay well we have

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.590
deals with the angel instead which I

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.360
think you could make a pretty easy case

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.760
for the idea that deals with the angel

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.170
are actually just strictly better than

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.200
deals with the devil if you've got chaos

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.950
you can get the same kinds of items sure

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.950
I don't mind

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.600
the Cuba meet here HP is fine you can

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.400
get the same items and they won't cost

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:50.640
you anything so I guess I should be

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:53.700
pleased with that two bombs I think we

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.580
should blow this guy up for money we got

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.040
a bomb back that's fine we do have a

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.490
reroll machine and none of these items

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.260
except maybe dry baby are worth picking

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:11.490
up right now so I'm just gonna you know

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:13.980
go for the fight here at the present

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.810
moment we're relatively okay we got a

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:20.760
lot of HP which is the most important

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:22.830
thing and our hopes and dreams don't

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.930
really hinge on anything right now you

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.770
know thank God we chose I mean you know

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.330
I'm not going to get into the whole

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.790
ashton kutcher butterfly effect sort of

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.770
thing but thank God we chose a character

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:35.520
that has a decent amount of HP because

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:39.690
if we were Judas soo we might already be

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:42.480
dead but we also would have the

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.790
potential to stomp at least like I'm

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.410
booked a Belial is a really nice item to

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:52.940
have in greed mode because you get a lot

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.940
of value out of a single play

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:59.700
whereas Isaac without the d6 it's really

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.290
just kind of a blank slate baby and I'll

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.730
write your name that's right

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.200
I've listened to the radio within the

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.200
past four years I'm familiar with a

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.610
couple of Taylor Hicks songs it's not

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.010
Taylor Hicks that's Taylor Swift Taylor

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.110
Hicks is the guy from American Idol who

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.150
was like 23 years old but had a full

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:18.240
head of gray hair it looked like Jaime

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.760
Lannister's uncle who works at a bank or

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.410
something but like he is a cool Bank you

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.610
know like they still rock out like they

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.010
don't have casual Fridays they have

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.240
casual Thursdays they do things

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.330
different they Marsh's the beat of their

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:34.229
own drum everything is still fi d c--

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:39.240
insured though okay uh use a little

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:40.440
money here four cents is more than I

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.849
would have liked to have used but there

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.280
you go you parasitoid tears which are

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:47.810
pretty good that looked like a five cent

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:51.209
guppies collar and I was a happy man I I

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:55.679
mean it's it's worth thinking about

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:57.689
must be pin oh it's big I saw envy and

00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:00.389
said to myself must be pin

00:08:57.689 --> 00:09:05.839
I just internalized Envy as being you

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:05.839
know one of us one of us for some reason

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:13.860
it's still a little bit behind the

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:15.600
eight-ball your parasitoid tears you

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:20.809
know they got a land to summon things

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:26.309
for us do I want to buy a 15 cent

00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:29.790
Guppies collar I think what chaos we

00:09:26.309 --> 00:09:30.959
should we don't really have a green mode

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.220
engine right now like we don't have

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:34.110
anything that gives us a bunch of money

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.449
like IV bag would be sweet right now but

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:39.720
I think we could still hedge our bets on

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:44.730
a guppy dream showing up so let's do

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.410
that and that's apparently free those of

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.970
you who work in retail how many times do

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.709
you hear that joke every day no price

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.019
tag on it must be free hot enough for

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:54.749
you working hard or hardly working am i

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:58.049
right TGIF buddy I just saved you like

00:09:54.749 --> 00:10:00.389
every possible conversation that you

00:09:58.049 --> 00:10:03.509
could have if you work in an office at

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:06.029
least I never worked to retail except

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:07.619
for a except for Goodwill and I'm

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:11.009
honestly very thankful for that I

00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:12.899
despite what I say on the NSS I actually

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:13.949
like you know I have a great respect for

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:18.779
the people who work in the service

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:21.059
industry I'm not mr. pink a tip and I

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:22.740
don't complain about it I'm never I'm

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:24.720
never asked to speak to somebody's

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.980
manager I don't even understand why you

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.929
would except to make yourself feel

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.189
better

00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:31.649
there's probably valid reasons but I've

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:33.839
never encountered them okay we got a

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:35.699
deal with the devil and it's another

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:38.970
deal with the devil with nothing which

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:42.209
is actually pretty terrible economy

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.639
starting to slow down a little bit here

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:46.709
and we're still at zero damage upgrades

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:48.389
so we're hoping chaos maybe put some

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:52.199
brimstone in our silver item room or

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:53.490
something contract from below I don't

00:10:52.199 --> 00:10:56.399
know why I said that like it was to the

00:10:53.490 --> 00:11:01.019
tune of a Disney song of a country from

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:04.140
below na Nana Nana doo doo doo doo doo

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:12.510
Scooby dooby doo Beauty and the

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:17.310
boos what card yonder window breaks it's

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:18.720
a demon judgment okay actually really

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.330
nice you know I said a temperance card

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.310
IV bag would be useful this is sadly not

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:30.980
an IV bag but still potentially pretty

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:35.520
great retro vision huh

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:38.490
lemonparty all right I'm gonna try to

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:46.470
blow you up here didn't get any money

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:48.270
out of it I I'm I'm wary now I'm happy

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.060
okay mysterious liquid is pretty good

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:54.990
I'm going to try to beat the odds here

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:57.180
and if this were greedy or mode we would

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.920
probably be screwed because it's not

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.750
greedy remote it's just greed mode I

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.060
think we have an okay chance of making

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.730
this work but this is like our Dunkirk

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.610
you know this is where we're either

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:13.250
going to be pushed into the sea or we're

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:16.050
going to make our glorious escape here

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.190
it's a bit of a ham-fisted analogy but

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.170
it's a good way of letting you know this

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:22.080
video sponsored by Dunkirk I know it's

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:25.940
weird no this is not sponsored by

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.860
Christopher Nolan's new film Dunkirk

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.450
which I actually have managed people are

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.910
very excited about it I managed to avoid

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.130
seeing literally any press for despite

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:37.680
having been to the movies you know

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.080
relatively frequently and relatively

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.160
recently I don't know maybe they just

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.160
don't think it's going to play well in

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.010
Canada for some reason we've got World

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.710
War 2 buffs here no doubt ask him about

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:52.470
the Juno Beach man see what happens okay

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:59.790
we're actually we're actually done great

00:12:52.470 --> 00:13:02.610
work by HP and that also came with the

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.500
luck upgrade I think are we going to

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.270
have enough money to still get Guppies

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.170
paw I think we should try to live and

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:12.480
then make Guppies pop come through here

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.760
give us our second guppy item also it's

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.870
a little bit of HP in my life a little

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:22.089
bit of Sandra by my side

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:24.610
a little bit of Searcy in my life a

00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:27.670
little bit of sand or by my side a

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:30.670
little bit of Gringo's all I need little

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:33.370
bit of Joffrey's what I see a little bit

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:36.010
Enid start getting the Sun a little bit

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:38.560
of John snow on the world okay that's

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.029
that got insufferable pretty fast but I

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.490
was just you know I'd like to keep my

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:46.660
brain as plastic as I can you know and I

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:49.960
thought to myself self could you a very

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:54.520
on a rudimentary level make Mambo number

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:58.540
5 about Game of Thrones mountain number

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:00.730
5 ha the Trampas

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.140
I don't know way there's got to be

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:06.640
something that fits for that the

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:08.170
Terrill's myrn anyway I know if you

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.490
don't like Game of Thrones this is a

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.720
hard time of the year for you because

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.820
everybody's talking about Game of

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.040
Thrones let me give you the same piece

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.110
of advice I give to people who go why

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.700
are there video games on TV oh my god

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.310
people won't stop talking about Evo oh

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.560
good the internationals on oh well it's

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.600
a super bowel oh I love when the sports

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.520
ball man hey you just shut up and let

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.950
people like things I understand that it

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.860
comes across as insufferable take your

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.850
petty sense of self-satisfaction

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.500
superiority and shove it up your

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:40.870
butthole you know how many times a year

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:42.640
I do this it just announced a new doctor

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:46.180
who everybody's talking about Doctor Who

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.790
again I find Doctor Who insufferable if

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.020
you enjoy it it's not the smirking mark

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.580
on your character I just don't like it

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.020
myself personally and everybody talks

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.450
about it all the time

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.410
now on the NL SS I tell people to shut

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.410
up about it but that's just because

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.520
again it's a character thing but you

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.510
know for the most part I don't go on

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:06.459
Twitter and go oh a new Doctor Who you

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:11.680
know let people enjoy the things that

00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:13.810
they enjoy you yeah yeah jerk anyway we

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.750
have now and I'm speaking myself here as

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:19.620
well and I'll try to shut up about it

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.620
too that's the other thing

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.700
we have you know survived our personal

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.470
Dunkirk here coming to theatres this

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.600
July and look at that we have an angel

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:32.000
room that has given us free HP that's

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:36.769
actually pretty solid now there's

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.450
probably no way we get a key here but

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:41.450
there's one potential way and that's

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.490
reroll get a two-cent key or sorry a

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.410
3-cent key thanks to a deal with the

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:48.740
devil all right sorry a steam sale

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:50.810
effectively and then what I'm getting at

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.589
is you know how sometimes items are half

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.310
priced that's what I was talking about

00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:56.990
unfortunately it didn't work out for us

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:59.750
but that's fine it was a waste of a bomb

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.820
but a relatively small problem here more

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:07.040
HP we're still at base level damage

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:10.720
which is really bad but we're also one

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.720
item away from becoming gov stir

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:16.100
explosive diarrhea can be a campy but

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:18.740
explosive diarrhea can be a really good

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.370
kill in greed mode but certainly not

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:25.160
right there so our first order of

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.959
business I think it would be nice to get

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.380
a key I'm not doing no key meta by the

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:30.890
way don't rest assured I've learned my

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.660
lesson

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:37.190
and been properly shamed for my you know

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.470
suspect mathematical reasoning when it

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.329
comes to no key meta we're in a bit of a

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.750
dicey spot we got into so much HP though

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:46.579
that I think we're relatively okay and I

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.670
might be playing a little badly here but

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:52.310
we also again I'll always rush to my own

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:54.860
defense when we've got no tears of no

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.209
tears and no damage upgrades at all by

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.060
the time we get to what is effectively

00:16:56.209 --> 00:17:00.860
the womb a lot of shots on the screen

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.880
here as well even our flies are not that

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:08.569
potent so I just on the last floor it

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.919
made way more sense Wow it made way more

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.919
sense in my opinion to grab

00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:22.500
the the guppy item that gives us a much

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.500
better chance of making like a huge play

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:33.540
so this is basically a nightmare

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:36.429
we really should step on the button but

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.470
stepping on the button feels like an

00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:41.620
admission of being bad at the game and

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:45.850
that's my own personal foible admittedly

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:47.470
but and i actually will stand I'm a

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.900
self-hating orbital user most of the

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.720
time but I will stand by my decision to

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.910
use an orbital here are tears just don't

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.770
do enough damage to be to be potent

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.590
we're going to run out of HP upgrades

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:01.690
pretty soon so or just HP in general

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.190
pretty soon I think we're going to get

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.370
more than five cents back so I'll tell

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:08.140
you what I'll grab a key we got a check

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:14.950
yeah varicose veins is actually pretty

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:19.540
good and these are perfect enemies to

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:24.010
fight with an orbital that felt very

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:27.059
good scolex maybe alright a scolex fight

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:29.500
with mysterious liquid is not

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:32.710
necessarily the most difficult fight in

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:39.910
the world because you should be hurt by

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:43.030
the by mysterious liquid not much as you

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.990
can tell trying to get some orbital

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.880
damage in there from time to time

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.880
varicose veins at least doing something

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.059
we can't afford to be hit too much

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.520
longer or too many more times but again

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:57.669
I still have to defend myself

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:59.770
we got Isaac's level base stats except

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:02.890
HP we've gotten like 30 HP and we've

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.970
turned most of it into spirit arts at

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:10.150
this point so it's kind of been

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:12.010
squandered but we also needed like a

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.660
source of damage so I don't feel too bad

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:17.860
about it we got 19 cents we're looking

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:19.510
for a reroll and I almost think that you

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.669
got to go deeper on this one you got to

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.380
go for a bigger reroll the other thing

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:25.570
we could do is buy the gifts and then

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.919
use it in an angel or devil deal but

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.600
because we have chaos I don't think it

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:29.250
matters so there

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.850
just like buying a random item which i

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:34.350
think is a bad idea right now we don't

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.669
have any more money so we have to decide

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.110
what we're going to do here and I think

00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:41.669
what we're going to do here is save our

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:47.010
money for the next floor if there was a

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:49.530
3-cent key I would have picked it up I

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.669
think I think what's cool about green

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.500
mode is that there is like a

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:55.679
mathematical approach that you can take

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:58.289
to it which doesn't sound that cool but

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:59.820
I like it because it makes things easier

00:19:58.289 --> 00:20:02.929
from like an analytical standpoint you

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:05.549
can essentially have like rules that

00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:07.770
optimally govern your Issac play which

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:10.080
is kind of neat even if I don't always

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.900
follow them like for example in most

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.309
situations a three dollar or a three

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.450
cent key is a must-buy

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:21.390
you're probably going to need a key

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:25.020
anyway it's never going to get cheaper

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.870
than that I don't think there was any

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:35.520
way out of that for us right there oh

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:37.950
mylanta dude Oh throw an HP away

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.590
admittedly but again I'm shooting I'm

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:46.080
not shooting no but I am shooting I'm

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:50.280
trying here this is a I think it's

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.830
crossing over in the bad run territory

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:55.200
not quite trainwreck mysterious liquids

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:58.080
pretty good parasitoids ears are very

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.390
nice and guppies uh yeah I was pretty

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:04.140
parable copies pause keeping us you know

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:06.720
afloat here deal with the angel free

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:09.720
item oh my god it's a damage upgrade we

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.549
have six point six for damage now this

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.080
is not our exit right like we have one

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:17.039
more chest floor or some that we have

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.960
two more floors oh okay this is where we

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:21.000
we start making our way downtown walking

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.470
fast stations pastime homebound

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.020
we're screwed on monster man well

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:29.309
because we know we're going to get no

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:32.010
yarrow rune or perthro rune sorry again

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:35.630
a reroll machine continuum is not very

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:38.669
good so I'm going to grab this key and

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.120
we'll see what we get here Trinity

00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:41.520
shield

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:46.140
I think Trinity shield is like

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.550
actly okay oh Jesus okay so our actual

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:53.150
game plan here is different than it was

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:55.650
on the last floor first off don't get it

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.200
secondly we have enough damage to not

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:01.350
have to use our orbital anymore we can

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.360
actually like hit enemies with our tears

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.680
and in a reasonable amount of time they

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.920
should die especially if we get some

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.610
parasitoid tears off of them enemies

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.000
beneath the surface

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:14.850
no just fighters okay easy money we're

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.680
at three HP and we've probably gotten as

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:20.060
high as like like if we had never used

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:22.620
Guppies paw we could be at like 8 HP so

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.820
this is not an encouraging situation

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.250
eventually we're going to deplete that

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.290
you know HP savings account and things

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:31.080
are going to be real nasty if we're not

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:33.690
strong by that point but this floor has

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:37.200
been so so so much easier than the last

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:41.190
one crickets head for free was really

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:45.540
like a 10 out of 10 pickup so we're

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:47.880
looking for rerolls here and really

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.130
we're looking for guppy items if

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.510
possible and I don't even think like if

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:54.960
we got nine lives I think we have to

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.820
take it but I don't think we would get

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.350
rid of Guppies paw for like guppy said

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.890
we'd buy it but I think we would keep

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:04.050
Guppies paw here as like a as a

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:08.910
get-out-of-jail-free card rest assured

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:10.680
by the way I hate I will buy this at 7

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.300
cents for three spirit hearts oh and

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.830
it's here is upgrade okay I know we

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.390
still have enough to get another guppy

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.160
item and if we don't get a reroll

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:21.180
somehow we can always buy that but why

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:24.240
so many breakfasts like that I'm not

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:26.160
bitter too much but it's like a lot of

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.500
breakfasts that don't make sense to me

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.510
it's not like we've been rocking the you

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.520
know d-4d 100 or something like that

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:36.420
where the heck is all the breakfast

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:39.690
coming from is it because we have so few

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.190
items on lock that like green mode just

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:48.120
doesn't have anything to offer us here

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:49.620
and I'm a little confused that I don't

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.810
know what I was thinking they're just

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.170
standing directly in front of the shot

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.910
as it comes in

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:58.390
this wave was pretty easy that we have

00:23:54.910 --> 00:24:00.160
17 cents so I think 18 cents I hate that

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.800
I've used so much money on rerolls but

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.350
we have had to kind of cultivate or

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:09.480
curate a winnable run here so we're

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:13.240
going to give you some money and I mean

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.020
these are not guns whatever we take here

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.670
is what we're going to be stuck with

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.950
Stephens a pretty good damage upgrade

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:20.020
but homing tears are also great I think

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:24.550
I'd probably prefer to have homing tiers

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:27.610
here and blank card without runes not

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:31.720
bad at all but but unlikely to be super

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:37.990
useful yeah I kind of saw that one

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:40.090
coming Krampus is the more dangerous

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.680
enemy but he also has the chance to hurt

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:47.140
the dark one so actually dude that

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:48.430
turned out ok we got on HP upgrade which

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.290
we can't means we can't go to our curse

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.520
room now I think we have to try to go to

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.640
our curse room so I'm going to use that

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.070
get three spirit arts keep this we get

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.900
bombs okay

00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:00.370
I mean obviously we got to go do we have

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.130
we have one more floor with like no

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:07.660
items that no item rooms but a shop is

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:11.620
that the way this works yes okay so we

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:18.910
need really I sort of feel like we need

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:22.720
a guppy pick up here I'm hoping you hook

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:25.420
me up with something Wow uh certainly

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:29.050
very unexpected to get that guppy item

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:30.730
right there now we should use Guppies

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:34.290
head temporarily because we don't need

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:39.280
Guppies pop probably for this segment

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:41.320
probably for this segment but we might

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.810
actually I won't even say might we

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.570
certainly are going to want Guppies Paw

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:48.190
for the greed fight because Guppies head

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.280
is only going to give us three flies so

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:54.550
I still don't give us a great chance of

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.200
making this run work it's been a while

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.760
since I fought super green super greed

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.500
is also very annoying I've kind of

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.410
forgotten the the algorithm you used to

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:05.080
fight him you stay away from him you get

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.370
in the corners because the one shot will

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.710
never hit you there I can't

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:11.770
remember and so we're basically going to

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:16.990
be winging it which is almost never a

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:18.400
good situation we got 20 cents is there

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:21.040
anything in there we actually wanted

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.040
right off the bat I just don't remember

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.360
I mean book of Belial is okay but I

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.559
think we're better off just shooting for

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:31.660
a reroll okay well is easy money you

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:32.910
spend five cents to get ten cents that's

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:36.970
a deal

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:39.550
and then we reroll as quickly as

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:47.860
possible preferably and you get tech X

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:53.320
very very good and homing tiers Tech X

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:54.790
is extremely solid tech X also works

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.070
real well with guppy I don't think we're

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:58.330
in group we're going to just get enough

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:01.300
money okay we're just going to get

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:03.700
enough money to buy one more item if we

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.410
don't reroll or we go for one reroll so

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:14.080
I think I'm going to go for one reroll

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:23.640
didn't get it just snag some HP we don't

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:26.140
need this either try not to get hit here

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.550
go through with our deal with the devil

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.309
fire deal with the angel I should say

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:33.390
which is just given us more HP and then

00:27:30.309 --> 00:27:33.390
abandon ship

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.860
grab Guppies paw

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:47.929
I think we've got an okay chance but I'm

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:49.340
admittedly still a little concerned like

00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:50.690
this green fight should be a joke I

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.340
don't think I should be concerned also

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.140
the quarter showing up was awesome here

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.590
because we can actually if we win donate

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.590
some money

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:02.539
wow this greed is like so much slower

00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:03.799
than the other greed we also get the

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:07.580
coupon which I don't think does anything

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:13.610
for us here but don't let them get the

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:15.470
money lebowski so we actually might be

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:19.039
making some progress here which is

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:20.570
surprising I really I'm not saying I

00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:22.909
deserve like you know the Congressional

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.350
Medal of Honor here for my performance I

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:25.940
mean for one I don't even think they

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.190
give that to people who aren't Americans

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.299
so I don't think I qualify to begin with

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.770
but feel free to you know sorry to

00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:34.610
change.org petition or something like

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:39.529
that for four floors we had no damage or

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:40.820
tears up grapes just HP so I was really

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:42.409
skeptical we were going to get enough

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.630
firepower to come through in the clutch

00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:46.880
on this one and we got way more than

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:49.279
enough firepower in the end tech X

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:52.490
homing tears and full guppy

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:54.169
transformation is actually like as good

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:59.750
as it gets more or less I mean of course

00:28:54.169 --> 00:29:01.970
we still only got one damage upgrade we

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.649
still only got crickets head but it's

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.630
enough it's enough when you've got you

00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:08.210
know so many flies being created and

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:10.399
also you know Tech X what a Dodge and

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.950
now it looks like I was faking it like

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:14.330
Oh things were real tough on this run do

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:17.570
the green fight don't even get hit at

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:20.049
all but you know go back go back to the

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:23.179
womb things were looking terrible there

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:25.730
we just got real lucky we got 35 cents

00:29:23.179 --> 00:29:28.039
to donate here we unlock a little chest

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.230
that's like the epitome of not really

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:32.000
being worth it at all lucky pennies have

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.320
appeared in the basement finally we

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.299
should have done this ages ago because

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.179
we were I think we were losing like two

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:43.539
luck per run by not having lucky pennies

00:29:38.179 --> 00:29:46.970
unlock special hanging shopkeepers and

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:51.380
this was a good reintroduction into the

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:53.750
mode of greed I'm going to be able to

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.040
donate I mean it's a 0% chance she

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:57.830
probably means it's like zero

00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:01.580
Oh point something Wooden Nickel I'm

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:03.320
sure yeah we're going to donate all of

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.110
it I'm just going to get in the box here

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:10.850
we get a special ending for green mode

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:14.870
it's been a while since a lead in the

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:18.260
greed mode well he's getting caved in

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:21.860
there I sure hope he makes it out at

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:28.030
some point oh and in the lore he becomes

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:32.210
the keeper but that's just a theory an

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:33.080
