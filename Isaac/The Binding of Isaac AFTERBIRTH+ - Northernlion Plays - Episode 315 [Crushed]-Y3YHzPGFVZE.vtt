00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.270
hey everybody welcome ignorant land

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.609
please abiding Lessig answer is Plus

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.340
where we are doing all right here we're

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.389
gonna random something inside that you

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.910
wanna see see dunno say that I read we

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.670
will play an skein it'll be all right

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.470
okay j1 7 m 3 m 2 e and an early boss

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.180
fight as well we've been I mean the run

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
that we lost this is like my first

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.820
recording session since the loss but my

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.650
my demeanor is positive dude and the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.759
reason my demeanor is positive is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.730
because they're lost

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.860
like I say it wasn't our fault however

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.770
we did kind of get trapped between a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.870
rock and a hard place

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.190
is it real James Franco asked situation

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.140
you know we've been playing well since

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
then and random runs to the start of a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.770
streak is a beautiful time to be playing

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.160
Isaac because you know your your your

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.690
carefree you ever notice like care less

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.449
and carefree have two different meanings

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.859
like wildly different it's not like you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.250
you're careful

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.540
care less and then carefree despite the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.470
fact that they might seem okay I don't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.100
know why I'm going down in this

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.960
etymological road here go a bit of a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.369
waste but you know I've played enough

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
Isaac in a day of again I'd never

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.299
suggest that I'm like one of them one of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.950
the absolute best players in the world

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.530
at this point you know I know where I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.590
stand I'm probably you know like the top

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.020
4% of Isaac players if you took a random

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.090
average class size there's a good chance

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.750
I could be the valedictorian of that of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.490
that particular class not a graduating

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.020
class because I know depending on what

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.000
school you go through graduating classes

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
can get absurd my our graduating class

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.560
like the the school that Michael al Fox

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.840
and I went to had like eighty graduating

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.810
students and our a High School

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.350
commencement ceremony that is still took

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.549
like you know a couple of hours so I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.140
don't know what happens if you go to a

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.250
high school you know like Kate was like

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.829
oh yeah there's like five hundred people

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.270
in my graduating class some people that

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.770
we've talked to that go to school in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.959
like big cities or at least big school

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.700
districts in the US would be like oh

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.000
yeah we look fifteen hundred kids in our

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.600
grad

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.560
in class mr. high school is maybe 6,000

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.840
students that's that's stupid it's not

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.460
stupid it's actually just amazing but it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.500
seems hilarious to me like where where

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.730
Michael al Fox and I went to school it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.920
was not conceivable that you would not

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.710
know everybody in the school it wasn't

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.210
like it was small town like everybody

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.920
walked around going like oh honey hello

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.750
neighbor you know you know but you know

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.790
you'd be like oh yeah that's X person I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.110
know this about them that's X person I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.500
know this about them but it wasn't like

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.950
if you go to a 1,500 person graduating

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.920
class you know you got like 50 modules

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.390
or 50 different periods of English I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.490
don't even think our high school is pod

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.830
59 our English classes in its entire

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.270
existence but anyway now 59 it would be

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.980
ridiculous I mean I mean 50 we've

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.830
certainly taught more than 50 I would

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.030
suggest anyway head down and explore

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.400
might have such great choice great

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.200
choice nothing wrong with us at all

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.060
in a way I'm envious of that because you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.440
know I'm sure the larger your your

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.170
school the more opportunities that are

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.060
afforded to you simply by you know the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.950
size of it like we didn't really have

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.320
computer classes at our high school we

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.300
could be Demming this is also you're

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.830
going to say like that's absurd and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:38.670
you'd be right it was also like I

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.519
started high school 15 years ago so it's

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.950
been it's not like the internet was not

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.190
a thing it was very much a thing but it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.620
just you know it wasn't like let me put

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.720
it this way we were like seven years

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.010
from the first iPhone it wasn't like

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.330
every eight-year-old on planet Earth was

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.040
it had a YouTube account and was yelling

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.780
at us in the comments like hey you know

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.510
you got to explore everywhere dead cells

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.250
anyway I finally taken that advice in my

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.220
life has improved let's not bite the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.750
hand that feeds they're like yeah we

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.140
didn't have we didn't have AP or IB

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.150
either which is a common thing at more

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.450
prestigious Canadian high schools and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.280
American of course but anyway you get

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.720
the idea I'm not reminiscing about the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.270
old days there's benefits to go into a

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.380
small town high school as well you know

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.970
really got to

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.070
no they are the student base in the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.430
faculty do I keep in touch with any of

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.650
them no that'd be weird I did I think I

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.860
did what every like college student

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.000
thinks about occasionally I didn't do it

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.760
but I thought about it which is like

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.700
yeah man a winter break from my first

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.230
year at college I just go back and hang

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.600
out at the high school and be like check

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.620
it out I made it and then I didn't do

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.850
that because by the time the winter

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.050
break rolled around I was like that

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:58.800
would be sort of pathetic and I'm glad I

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.110
didn't but anyway this episode's gone

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.940
off on a tangent early here what's the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.290
what's the game plan for us here but

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.490
we're Kane and we're coming up to our

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.070
first floor deal with the devil that's

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.920
more or less guaranteed given normal

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.090
circumstances so I'm very very confident

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.260
we're going to come out of this one with

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.480
a W something that would help out a lot

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.970
is like unicorn stomp I think it's just

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.890
a penny yeah IV bag would also help out

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.410
the reason for this I hope is fairly

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.600
obvious we have Midas touch so anything

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.240
we can use to create invincibility even

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.270
temporarily is going to stomp on enemies

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.010
we also got 41 cents early dull razor

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.450
would also work for us so you know then

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.830
we can use our money to pick up

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.090
something that enables Midas touch I'd

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.750
be happy but I do think that Midas touch

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.320
deep pockets

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:57.600
well we already had polydactyl this was

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:59.580
unnecessary um I do think that maybe

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.790
like the Midas touch setup is a little

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.760
overrated by myself I used to think it

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.350
was awesome and honestly my memory is

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.110
override - touch it

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:13.830
forgot about that the Midas touch xix

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.410
effect but to be honest with you I think

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.210
it might have used to been good and now

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:23.480
is not as good for whatever reason but

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:26.490
um oh you mean you gotta take diplopia i

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.470
I've had it on a couple of occasions not

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.030
like full occasions but like you know

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.350
chariot Midas touch and then I'm running

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.360
into enemies like why aren't these

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:38.220
enemies eating it but I digress

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.100
two of clubs is not in all likelihood

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.270
worth using right now I would love to

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.430
get invincibility because again

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.120
invincibility also gives us essentially

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.160
infinite money infinite money you know

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.560
with absolute power or that's not the

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.720
way that Uncle Ben said that absolute

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.790
power corrupts absolutely okay so we

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.650
will take mom's knife and we will take

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.630
Guppies head and we will take the

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.030
ability to fly and we'll take Guppies

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.920
collar and there's actually not much

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.050
reason to take anything else here to the

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.860
best of my knowledge what's hilarious

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.410
about this is we've just won this run

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.600
we're going to do so in like

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.950
unbelievable fashion like it's a really

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.750
funny way to make this happen is one

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.980
again that we can help that could have

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.650
waited for another trinket but who cares

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.510
and beyond that what should have gone

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.890
out of the curse room but beyond that we

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.010
still have deal with the Angel precedent

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.980
which is the most hilarious part of all

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:37.620
so this alone is probably the best

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.060
diplopia I've ever had and I mean I've

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.919
used the pokey on a number of different

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:46.320
circumstances but sincerely to get a be

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.180
cool here to get mom's knife to guppy

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.250
items and the ability to fly out of it

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.110
is pretty ridiculous shoopdawhoop is

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.740
tempting I don't know probably I feel

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.419
like critical consensus from the

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.460
audience about shoopdawhoop and about

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:01.919
Guppies hat are like the same they show

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.930
up very frequently they're both very

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:05.610
very strong I feel like you know you

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.810
might have your your reasons one is

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.700
better than the other and in some

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:13.919
situations you know one will be better

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:17.340
than the other and vice versa but follow

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:20.370
that damage dude in our present

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:24.450
situation we really are just like loving

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:27.720
it so what would I recommend to myself

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.970
here play slower you've taken a lot of

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.919
damage like there is a chance you lose

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:35.880
this because you're on to HP you

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:37.620
shouldn't but there is a chance all you

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.330
really need to do is live long enough to

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.770
get one more spirit heart and I know

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.360
this is not how this floor has turned

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.039
out for us so far but one spirit are

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.440
should give you a lot of survivability

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:48.040
with a run in which you can fly and and

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:53.259
kill basically everything in

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:57.490
so try not to try to throw your run away

00:08:53.259 --> 00:09:02.829
here you really did get the rarest of

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:04.779
rare situations that is you got a four

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:06.430
prong deal with the devil that's so good

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:09.699
you've got a four prong deal with the

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:12.699
devil when you also had a diplopia to

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:15.190
make the best possible use of it so it's

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:17.130
pretty great so you can pay for cambian

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:22.259
conception and I think we will

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:24.550
does does concern me a little bit for

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:26.440
reasons that I'm assuming are probably

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.670
relatively obvious and that's that you

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.670
know two hits could kill me right now

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:36.819
but I like Kim being conception and that

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:39.490
we like let's just be 100% honest here

00:09:36.819 --> 00:09:42.360
we should win this run and if we lose

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:45.730
this run we deserve it at this point so

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.110
to play conservatively because like you

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.459
know we have mom's knife we're probably

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:51.550
going to become Guffey but I'm a little

00:09:48.459 --> 00:09:53.589
scared about our HP is outside of a

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:58.649
daily or outside of like you know the

00:09:53.589 --> 00:10:01.329
100th win on a streak is a little silly

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:03.190
we got a we got to lay all our cards out

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:04.779
on the table here so who wouldn't

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.120
could've hurt and then I would have been

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:09.160
singing a different tune potentially we

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.110
do have curved horn and honestly we

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:15.220
still have canes bass damage it's great

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:17.079
with moms knife but the more the merrier

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.269
as far as damage goes especially when it

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:25.589
comes to two bosses that are unlikely to

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:29.230
die in a single hit secret room and

00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:34.029
could provide us with money but I don't

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:35.230
really see the purpose of trying to get

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:37.050
some extra money out of that right now

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.550
let's see what we can get from our shop

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.220
blank card two of clubs of course has

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:44.079
some interesting potentiality here now

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.149
I'll use a bomb because money is an

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:49.209
interesting situation

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:51.160
look this card to a close okay so now I

00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:54.240
think you buy a blank card and you go

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.240
blank card to a clubs

00:10:55.019 --> 00:11:00.610
you blow this up then you go to a clubs

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.160
then you go to of it that's just a 20

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.810
bond that's not that good man that was

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.540
there's a lot of money wasted to get you

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.040
to 20 bombs does their spirit are for

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.120
sale to go back and by the spirit art

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.410
you owe me one brain that was a bad play

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.839
we could still go blank card and blank

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.399
card is is fun because we could have

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:20.940
gone with blank card in general to be

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:20.940
honest with you

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:28.050
6.20 damage this substantial upgrade not

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:28.050
a doubt about it

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:32.440
sack of sacks is great as well yeah I

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.540
mean I'm kind of I feel like we whipped

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.070
but it's not like we're feeling the burn

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.899
too much from having Guppies head here

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.209
and Guppies head it's got its own you

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:42.820
know assortment of of usefulness that we

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:44.110
can be happy about regardless so this is

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.170
really the kind of steamroll that I've

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.490
been looking for for a while now we hit

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:51.250
we've had some easy runs I mean we had

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:53.079
Anna's asel run recently that's about as

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.570
easy as it gets in principle at least

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.940
where we get rid of spades I'll just go

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.980
ahead and call a spade a spade

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.890
but the ace of spades is not

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.260
particularly strong and pageant boys

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:08.920
kind of interesting there we go

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.300
I'm actually going to ace of spades it I

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.980
want to be able to create an arcade on

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.579
the next floor because I'm well wait a

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.160
minute next floor is necropolis 1 still

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:19.990
the IV bag is is still desirable for us

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.410
like Guppies head is great of course but

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.820
the the IV bag is a huge get for us

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.270
because we can use Midas touch with it

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.270
productively

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.430
I'll just tell you straight up though

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.769
you have already seen what is likely to

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:39.070
be the most memorable part of this run

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:40.930
that deal with the devil is proud to

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:45.420
deal with the devil diplopia what it's

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:47.829
not really like a once a lifetime thing

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.170
but it's the sort of thing where I could

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:52.300
make a thumbnail that's like oh my god

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.640
the greatest deal with the devil ever

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.920
and it wouldn't seem misleading like

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.660
there would still be some like oh my god

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.209
why are you using clickbait sort of

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.279
stuff you know in the comments but you

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:05.550
could be like you could defend that I

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:08.529
think is what I'm trying to get at

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:12.839
because it really is a jump a very very

00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:15.399
very good situation but did you see this

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:17.110
no matter keys we picked up in like one

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:26.110
room okay

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:28.540
I mean sure what is this it I feel like

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.240
it's actually sort of great

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.980
we have Jacob's Ladder our damage is

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.180
still good now we've got infinite range

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.920
we still have we still have the godet

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.110
obviously I'm not go ahead sorry so the

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.790
curved horn not that dissimilar actually

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:48.730
at least they seemed to come from the

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:50.829
same beast don't ever let people lead

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.290
you believe I done anything for you

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:56.110
you know this is just give me the copy

00:13:53.290 --> 00:14:00.670
payout come on we're taking everything

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:05.100
here but I don't think this is that much

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:09.490
worse now I do see curse of the tower I

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:11.079
don't like it so we're going to endeavor

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.339
to not get it I always think that I have

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:13.959
holy mantle by the way when I see

00:14:12.339 --> 00:14:16.149
Jacob's Ladder on a reroll I'm like ah

00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:17.800
sick holy mantle and now Leo is not

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:20.020
wholly male but then oh my god Jacob's

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.660
Ladder but we seem to be re rolling into

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.949
a lot of Jacobs ladders sad bombs you

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.449
seem to be rear Olding into a lot of

00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:28.060
Jacobs ladders they'd like do nothing

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:32.440
for us similarly sad bombs Plus

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:34.910
technology is like not very strong

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.860
not as strong as the average sad bombs

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.660
maybe but maybe we'll make up for that

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.720
with our damage stat I will take

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.430
guillotine mostly because if this in

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:49.430
this case it almost doubled our rate of

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:52.010
fire so plus the reckless of damage

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:54.440
bonus out of it as well again not quite

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.390
as strong maybe there's not quite as

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.700
much potential but still very very good

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.840
we want to get that last guppy item

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.700
which at this point is probably most

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.900
likely to happen by a Kaos if we can get

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:07.640
it in here but such like they hanged man

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.990
we're not flying anymore so the hangman

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.970
actually could provide us with some

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:14.360
value and we don't have Midas touch so

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.070
we don't to worry about IV bag although

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.070
I would like to worry about IV bag we

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:21.410
don't really have the desirability it's

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:24.860
got to be someone with the know-how and

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:27.980
the elbow grease to lead us to our new

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.930
land no not me and technology we don't

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:37.640
have the cognitive capacity to lead all

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:39.740
right we'll do it that's two already

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.750
it's a great sign wouldn't mind picking

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.270
up you know at least a half red hearts

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:47.720
but ok you know thanks for your concern

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:50.080
there I appreciate it if piggy bank we

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.960
do that's where the money's coming from

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:58.100
also got wicked spiders dude how are we

00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:00.080
creating so many spiders is it just

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:05.090
juicy sac but they're like we're killing

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:07.130
enemies quickly enough that they that

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.980
they never attack enemies so we're

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:12.890
getting like a net positive it seems

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:17.000
plausible will we do boss rush on

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:19.670
today's run I will consider doing boss

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.800
rush on today's run I would prefer to

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.440
just teleport out of it but we do have

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:30.080
the kind of you know damage that I think

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:32.540
it's conducive conducive to making it

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.990
happen and personally I mean that it

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.370
does help actually just watch out for

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:44.069
the bombs back here

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:45.329
I don't know it canes other I might be

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:47.850
my least favorite item in the game

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:49.379
simply because of the reaction that I

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.059
had when I opened the room well you're

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:53.850
like you know the world is your oyster

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:55.230
man it's like you got this oyster you're

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.490
gonna crack it open and get a beautiful

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.620
pearl what could it be Oh could be

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.920
anything it could even be garbage but at

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.720
least remarkable garbage and then it's

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:07.679
and then it's Kane's other eye and

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:11.159
you're like inside of this oyster that

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:13.169
don't speak to me inside of this oyster

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:15.360
is just a piece of paper that says like

00:17:13.169 --> 00:17:18.600
you won it's not worth anything to me

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.240
right now I need I need something more

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.579
you know mr. bombastic if I'm going to

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:27.110
be excited about this situation as it

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:30.330
stands oh Jesus

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:34.350
okay so you know I was really cheesed

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:36.840
off oh my god Enel are you okay you just

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:40.169
said geez Louise aren't you worried

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.909
about what your fan base will think you

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:43.169
know what cheese and crackers to that

00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:49.610
I'm my own man

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:52.440
I still I ignore playing the key beggar

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:55.260
outside of the chest or the dark room I

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.850
suppose but out of principle it's kind

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.580
of like the bomb beggar I don't

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:02.100
understand why you would ever give him a

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:05.100
bunch of keys for the chance to get like

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.020
attack fly sure if you got 70 keys I get

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.820
it but you know we could get Guppies

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.830
tail and then we're going to get a lot

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.230
more out of 70 keys via Guppies tail

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:18.179
than we ever would from this unlucky

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:20.700
so-and-so a bummer that we don't even

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:22.679
get to donate our money I guess if we go

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.610
to the hush fight we will and we kind of

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:30.870
have we have a horrible run but oh to be

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:32.250
honest with you taking a little bit of

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.899
damage here I mean much of it was from

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.240
walking on spikes like an idiot so it's

00:18:33.899 --> 00:18:39.390
not like I can complain that much but I

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.620
just want to make sure that if we're

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.210
going to do that I want to make sure

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.039
we're safe that was actually I mean

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.159
obviously 100 cent my own fault but I

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:48.750
was worried about like doing damage with

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:50.790
our guillotine head and probably should

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:56.550
not have been oh this is like

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:56.550
and you absolutely take Incubus

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:08.419
there's nothing good enough I almost

00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:09.889
feel like a sense of duty to do the boss

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:11.389
rush because of the fact that the

00:19:09.889 --> 00:19:17.119
Incubus pickup is going to make us so

00:19:11.389 --> 00:19:19.039
strong but it's just like they haven't

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:23.149
given me a compelling reason to do so on

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:24.789
this floor at least you know what if I

00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:27.559
can say one positive thing about

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:31.639
nearsighted friend it is going to give

00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:33.469
us the ability to get the occasional

00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:35.809
Jacob's Ladder tear now I don't think

00:19:33.469 --> 00:19:42.199
that's going to be worth anything at all

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:44.509
basil but it's something also I'm just

00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:50.979
now realizing that we actually have 45

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:52.759
million well damaged yes but 45 million

00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:56.509
familiars here I can't believe we

00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:58.969
haven't gotten conjoined yet but a more

00:19:56.509 --> 00:20:00.559
pressing concern is really that I can't

00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:02.539
get that second Incubus to deal damage

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:09.409
if I ever move from where the room

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:12.079
actually starts so we're a I wouldn't

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:13.849
say inhibited too much by that like the

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:18.949
Incubus damage is really just a bonus

00:20:13.849 --> 00:20:20.179
but we're not quite popping up quite as

00:20:18.949 --> 00:20:21.949
much as I'd like to you know what be a

00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:24.199
cool item

00:20:21.949 --> 00:20:29.059
I don't modding is cooled off a little

00:20:24.199 --> 00:20:31.579
bit but a cool item would be if you

00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:34.909
could have like a familiar smelter that

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:37.069
gave you up familiar and then whenever

00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:39.559
you use the space bar item it turned all

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:43.399
it rolled all of those familiars effects

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:47.289
into your existing familiar hurry you're

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:49.759
like mega Voltron familiar

00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:51.559
honestly like I know people become

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:53.239
attached to their own ideas and I'm

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:56.839
guilty of that as well but this is such

00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:58.099
a good idea that I'm kind of like I'm

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.839
thinking somebody must have done it

00:20:58.099 --> 00:21:02.139
already and I'm just like remembering

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:05.029
that it exists and taking credit but you

00:21:02.139 --> 00:21:08.959
know because there are disadvantages to

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:11.869
having a bunch of familiars the big one

00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:15.259
is obviously just an xl-4 just a regular

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:15.879
old womb the big one is obviously that

00:21:15.259 --> 00:21:18.940
it's harder to

00:21:15.879 --> 00:21:20.440
but imagine you know you had as many

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.179
familiars as we did you press the

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.849
spacebar all of a sudden you got one

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:26.829
mega familiar that does you know the

00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:29.139
damage of faiths reward plus brother

00:21:26.829 --> 00:21:31.109
Bobby plus it as rainbow babies random

00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:33.249
to your effects plus it as the you know

00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:34.839
Incubus lasers coming out at all times

00:21:33.249 --> 00:21:36.989
you have to do some creative work there

00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:41.249
I think like when it comes to the damage

00:21:36.989 --> 00:21:43.719
involved but because you can't really

00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:45.669
have it if you got ten familiars that

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:47.109
all shoot it's here you can't have it

00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:49.149
shoot ten tears when you press the

00:21:47.109 --> 00:21:51.940
button once I like it it just doesn't

00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:57.069
seem to make sense it's like more rate

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:59.199
of fire than can exist in the game seems

00:21:57.069 --> 00:22:02.649
to strike it diminishing return straps

00:21:59.199 --> 00:22:05.289
but you know seems to strike up

00:22:02.649 --> 00:22:07.059
diminishing returns of course but you

00:22:05.289 --> 00:22:10.299
know think about it also I don't know

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:13.269
how would work with things like dark bum

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:14.979
but what a concept

00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:21.339
I could use a little mod myself when we

00:22:14.979 --> 00:22:24.909
could all use a little change a try

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:26.859
Ahmed who is well and truly dusted mom's

00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:32.729
heels for a range upgrade we do not care

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:39.449
about I will say I miss the I miss the

00:22:32.729 --> 00:22:39.449
map which was doing lovely work for us

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:46.179
I'm really trying to make this copy

00:22:43.959 --> 00:22:47.829
dream come true because this without

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:49.419
exaggerating we don't have the greatest

00:22:47.829 --> 00:22:51.309
damage of all time although it's very

00:22:49.419 --> 00:22:54.699
good especially with our ridiculous rate

00:22:51.309 --> 00:22:56.319
of fire but I think we could have one of

00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:57.849
the strongest guppy runs in recent

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:59.229
memory if we if we finish the guppy

00:22:57.849 --> 00:23:03.609
dream here and of course we do have a

00:22:59.229 --> 00:23:04.690
good chance of completing our or getting

00:23:03.609 --> 00:23:06.789
our deal with the devil on this floor

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:09.399
which would be helpful all this feels

00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:12.729
also fine but I don't know what the

00:23:09.399 --> 00:23:15.639
present moment is kind of weird like a

00:23:12.729 --> 00:23:17.349
0% chance to lose we're kind of coasting

00:23:15.639 --> 00:23:20.889
until we get that one thing that lets us

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:22.959
pop ridiculously we're already at nine

00:23:20.889 --> 00:23:25.329
out of ten but this could be a 10 out of

00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:27.040
10 run it just needs I mean it really

00:23:25.329 --> 00:23:28.810
just needs a one guppy ice

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.070
the big thing there's probably some

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.650
other tear effects that would work as

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:37.360
well but the one guppy item would really

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:38.110
really be helpful it would be an easy

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.090
fix

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:42.010
let's put it that way now I'm looking at

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.130
the map and I'm saying to myself self I

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:47.050
don't know if we're going the right way

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.670
this seems like you know you get like a

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.860
little bit of a sense for the mapping

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:53.620
and Isaac the more you play and this

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.200
feels like a trick to me it's just like

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.030
too good to be true

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:02.350
that we found an area so devoid of dead

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:05.860
ends so early callous is good to me

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:07.300
now we can only hold one house is not

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.440
really good but it's really good when

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.180
you're an idiot and you've walked over

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.180
the spikes as many times as I have so

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.930
well I was incorrect that just goes to

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.820
show you that's the other rule of Isaac

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.200
is like you know the more the more you

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.550
play the less you know there's many

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.100
rules I'm going to be publishing them in

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.680
a book on Amazon then going on a tour

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:29.350
this summer tickets are $75 each if you

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.430
want to come see me no script I haven't

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.900
really prepared me I'm just going to

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.420
kind of get up there and say thank you

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.510
what do we got a pact that's great

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:40.090
brimstone oK we've entered like full

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:50.080
ridiculous territory now we have

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:53.650
anti-gravity vain' notice we now have

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:57.390
had brimstone and mom's knife on the

00:24:53.650 --> 00:25:01.660
same run and sad bombs for that matter

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:03.610
also fantastic

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.780
and yet I still like you know what do

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.549
you get for the man who has everything

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:10.049
for some reason I find myself looking at

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:16.419
this running going it could be better

00:25:10.049 --> 00:25:20.940
it's probably a little ridiculous mostly

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:25.900
just that antigravity little horrible

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:30.460
with brimstone it's not like you know

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:37.059
what we probably should have been hit

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:38.740
there but shoopdawhoop is so good and I

00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:40.990
don't think we'll need the spear at ours

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:47.080
because we're to be frank kind of

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:49.000
crushing it right now I think we should

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.820
take shoopdawhoop just because it gives

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.850
us burst damage instantaneously so I

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.799
want to be able to like more or less

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.960
Poupon enemies enemies that are

00:25:56.799 --> 00:26:02.080
stationary like these guys are that you

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.940
know they got no chance but room like

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.909
this much happier to hit him with that

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:10.289
burst damage spiders are doing great

00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:12.580
work it's a good time to be alive like

00:26:10.289 --> 00:26:14.860
I'm not going to lie to you this runs in

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:18.130
a great spot it also got it got weird

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.169
the reroll was fantastic despite looking

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.880
sort of not that great it looked like we

00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:25.150
had maybe like a soymilk apocalyptic

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:27.789
sort of thing going on but obviously

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.710
they ended up not being the case I'm

00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:31.720
very thankful as a result don't don't

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.659
spam bomb to me please yeah okay this is

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.370
there's too many enemies you've done

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:37.600
that to yourself I just want you to know

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.429
that there was a chance that we could

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.419
have lived in harmony in there and you

00:26:39.429 --> 00:26:43.690
chose not to

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:44.799
you chose to mess that up and for the

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.230
rest of your life you're going to have

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:48.370
to live with that decision

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:54.640
trying to get the portal on top of them

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:56.950
at which point he will just die we got

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.230
like kind of a half assed speedrun going

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.000
on here but can't deny that it's got a

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.440
good reason to be like that it's another

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.850
good selection of items I'm going to

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.150
re-roll our stats we got tears off

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.950
damage down totally fine we'll take

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.890
mom's contact will also take contagion

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.680
will blow this up

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:16.260
and we'll get balls of steel speed up

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.080
which is good and I'm excited which is

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:23.550
terrible but as fines kill this guy and

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:26.790
then dust this room as quickly as

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:29.250
possible 20 bombs might not seem like a

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:33.720
lot but when your bombs are doing what

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:36.060
our bombs are doing we're completely sad

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:43.170
we also have one luck somehow that

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:46.670
managed to pay out with with an item

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.670
here which is kind of surprising to me

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:54.390
we have number two as well and the heck

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.490
did that happen this I find myself like

00:27:54.390 --> 00:28:00.480
off balance and commentary on this run

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:03.690
and it's honestly because the run is so

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:06.860
good that I'm waiting for like the other

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.860
shoe to drop here

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:25.260
but it's you know certainly a very

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:27.179
merciful run this was a run where we

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.510
pretty mean from the second-floor deal

00:28:27.179 --> 00:28:32.520
with the devil well I'm trying to I'm

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:36.150
building an inelegant moment here let's

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.220
build it more elegantly we had a deal

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.169
with the devil that gave us four items

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.210
including mom's knife and two copy items

00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:43.470
and the ability to fly in fact that's

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.900
just a description of all the items we

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.120
got in there uh and I threw it away on

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.030
purpose and then got something that was

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.460
almost as good that's like being a

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.659
professional athlete making like you

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.940
know 20 million dollars a year and

00:28:54.659 --> 00:28:58.500
you're like you know what decider it

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.120
isn't for me I'm going to go back to

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.950
school for the Performing Arts and

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.620
everyone's like you're an idiot and then

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:07.380
they become a multi you know million

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:10.950
dollar earning recording artist you know

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:13.590
there are the genuine double threat this

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.780
run there are three good runs in this

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.130
run basically because it changed a

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:21.299
little bit when we picked up brimstone

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:22.799
as well I don't think I would do

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:24.960
delirium on this fight because I want to

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:26.280
preserve the wonderful memory of what we

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.340
have and thankfully we didn't even have

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.809
a choice just an all-around good run out

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.299
