##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.770
everybody welcome ignorant language

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.299
money let's get her plus great runs

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.980
rates and Lee

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.160
we got the outline of the postage as

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:18.350
Lazarus and who are we missing a lot of

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.910
stuff on blue baby Samson

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.369
let's do the Samson run we've done boss

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.840
rush all we need to do is win by any

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.279
means necessary

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.520
plz SF z3k a little actually I prefer to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.899
be on LTE uh-huh a little joke for my

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.629
telecommunications nerds out there I

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.309
don't know what LT e means light

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.640
transfer experience largest transfer

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.579
experience be fair I don't know what 4G

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.730
means either was there ever a time where

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.550
we were on 1g do they call it 1g or did

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.510
they just call it G and then when there

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.879
was 2g

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.649
did they ever consider it calling it GGG

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.449
so eventually we could get to the point

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.890
where we could say Gee Gee Gee Gee baby

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.869
baby baby I lived in Korea for a year oh

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.020
you'll allow me to make a dated kpop

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.460
reference okay I mean if not just allow

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.229
but you really can't stop so we did

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.299
screw over a deal with the devil chances

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.009
here but honestly like some things are

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.689
more valuable than a deal with the devil

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.430
champs and one of those things is being

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.240
able to finish that room before I die of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.790
old age

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.150
thanks to these freaking spiders so just

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.189
fly around getting behind cover and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.680
annoying the bejesus out of me it's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.390
possible to see we screwed it up oh no

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.130
we got lucky and they sort of started

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.770
spreading the virus again but if

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.250
possible it's better to kill an enemy

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.100
that is surrounded by other enemies to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.479
begin our our rooms here because then

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.130
the outbreak will spread and we'll be in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.320
a better place as a result you're

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.799
probably going down man you missed it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.670
somehow

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.079
yeah we've been we've been playing okay

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.850
there have been some runs recently where

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.790
I've been a little embarrassed by my

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.560
play but in a way it's almost I don't

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.140
mean this would be like self

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.810
what's the we're looking for

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.490
self-aggrandizing I guess but it's kind

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.450
of had precedents taken away from the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.980
fact that I played a little badly

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.500
because of the novelty of being on a new

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.630
save file but that is going to wear out

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.840
soon if not having worn out already so

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.030
we should further buckle off of gaming's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.400
there's no real reason most of the time

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.230
to be losing a run in the late game I

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.700
still stand by the idea that there's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.400
always an excuse to be losing a run in

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.720
the early game with certain characters

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.120
you know life comes at you fast if

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.950
you're playing as a Judas or you're

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.810
playing as even then like a bad even

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.090
start blue baby things happen you know I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.580
think that would have done it but to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.370
lose like a run at the very end of the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.700
game due to just bad play is really like

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.890
where it all falls apart black bean huh

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.540
all-time classic grade item one of the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.390
all-time greats black bean everybody

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.220
black bean

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.590
students internet Zen nsns sense sense

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.970
and I'm not particularly interested in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.470
its effects because it is useless

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.549
although I will admit if we're

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.950
stretching this out if we're going to

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.260
make this full-on ESPN NFL offseason

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.140
what does this tweet mean levels of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:23.500
discourse black bean at least fits into

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.530
our plans to have ib bag later we could

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.100
theoretically use the black bean to deal

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.780
damage every time we get hurt with AI be

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.390
back I don't expect it to be reliable

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.579
but I do expect it to do something

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.850
potentially so can we open this golden

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:46.239
chest up here we can but it'll cost us a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.340
bomb and a bomb and key for a golden

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.660
chest is not a bad deal necessarily but

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.239
we could use that bomb to just get a

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.590
tinted rock instead and you might think

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.630
this is silly but I'm actually going to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.620
blow myself up here as well get that

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.620
extra

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.450
damage bonus take us to 4.5 for the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.360
upcoming boss fight - spirit arts good

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.030
payout it gives us the best chance we

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.560
could have asked for really to at least

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.700
maintain our deal with the devil chance

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.260
it's never going to get higher than a

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.799
third rate here unless maybe like you

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.430
give me the pentagram right off the bat

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.270
but I find this probably unlikely one of

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:32.830
these guys are still afflicted with the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.900
outbreak I can't really consciously plan

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.170
to use it I think that's too many

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.940
spiders one of them is a natural spider

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.430
you can tell you know the champion ones

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.440
had the same kind of tint to them that

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.790
the that the the boss does but then

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.380
there's like this guy's lived through

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.460
the whole fight he's live longer than

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.260
the boss don't take the HP a time

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.980
necessary all things considered it's

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.290
probably very very unlikely to get more

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.540
difficult than a champion rag man so we

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:10.000
should at least count ourselves lucky to

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.850
some extent there oh we were so close to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.160
perfection

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.060
why instead of like that hello huh we

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.770
were so close to bear faction you have

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.450
to excuse me from a commentary

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.890
standpoint I'm a little distracted

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:29.590
because I I got HBO Canada just now they

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.620
got me I'm not going to get on the

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.190
soapbox about it but I like Game of

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.380
Thrones

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.690
I want to watch Game of Thrones as it

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.390
comes out dude these are all pretty good

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.610
the good news is we only need one of the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.020
flying items so we'll just take spirit

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.310
of the night and dark bomb and we beat

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.320
the odds of a deal with the devil which

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.390
is really nice but let's go back and get

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:57.010
some spirits the only way to get well

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:59.410
the only legal way to watch HBO shows as

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.000
they come out in Canada is in to the

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.200
best of my knowledge and I did research

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.510
it a little bit but there might be I

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.790
guess you'd get a VPN or so

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.950
like that but I think is to get HBO on

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.260
your cable service and then also you can

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.910
then watch it on demand on the app that

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
comes with the movie network in Canada

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.100
yeah that's right our movie network is

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.020
called the movie network I can't defend

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.220
it I'm just telling you like I like it

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.140
is but either way so I called my cable

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.020
company I don't mind a Tweel's expensive

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.090
but I really like HBO and to be honest

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.890
with you I do turn on the TV like three

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.300
times a week I'm doing like in a

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.740
programming assignment or something I

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.970
like to have like a bad movie on the

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.650
background and the movie network is

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.650
great for getting those normally I have

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.030
to just turn into the space channel and

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.340
then they'll be playing like you know

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.440
Prometheus for the 900th time and I'm

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.810
like okay let's watch but that's fine by

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.080
me but here's what bums me out

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.240
it is now 6:00 p.m. that's 9:00 p.m.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.390
Eastern Standard Time Game of Thrones

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:06.630
season 7 episode 1 has started airing on

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:10.440
the East Coast right now it's on West

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.270
Coast does an air until 8 p.m. Pacific

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.850
time are there ways around this of

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.010
course come on your boy grew up in an

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.590
answer age I know all about your bear

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.460
shares and your lime wires and sorry

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.050
Torrance what are those not I know all

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.360
about what you're going to suggest to me

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.330
as if I've been living under a rock for

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.800
a million years I like to support media

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.270
creation because I work in the media

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.730
creation industry and I have a

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.620
disposable income that allows me to you

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.180
know support content creators I enjoy

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.880
and then be self-righteous about it

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.800
afterward however what's up with this

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.100
nonsense why can't we watch it all

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.100
simultaneously

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:54.260
I'm not saying that necessarily you know

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:57.200
you should wait until 9 p.m. PST and

00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:00.370
then put it on you know at midnight and

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.870
also at 9 p.m. you know what I mean like

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.760
12:00 Eastern is 9 Pacific so I'm not

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.460
saying you should just cater to PSD why

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.710
not just put it on here at 6 and then

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:14.300
also put it on again at 9 you know a

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.740
rewatch I know that they think they

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.330
probably have good reasons but I'm here

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.100
to tell you as a millennial killing

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.810
other industries for doing this sort of

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.880
stuff stop that

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:26.000
HBO you're able to survive right now

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.100
because you would have unparalleled or

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.320
at least for a long time on paralleled

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.060
shows you know Curb Your Enthusiasm to

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.860
it I just realized literally just now

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.810
while I'm talking new curve season

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.760
starts in October I'll be able to watch

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:41.630
it as it comes on the air that's sweet

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.890
you know what's the other one insecure

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.820
great show Silicon Valley's I love it

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.560
even though I've only seen like five

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.660
episodes of season 3 on an airplane once

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.920
I was like I understand the show to some

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:59.390
extent I think it's fun I don't care I

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:02.950
love it anyway what was I saying you got

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:05.270
to stop that I'm a reasonable man

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.920
other people are going to resent you for

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.610
this decision probably already have and

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:12.020
we're 70s deep on this point and you're

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.810
asking people for something that is

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:17.690
unrealistic for them to meet you want to

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.400
wait an extra two hours versus the

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.140
people that they know who lives slightly

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.560
further you know towards the eastern

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:28.850
seaboard than them just because of where

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.260
you live the same thing happens on Steam

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.360
I'll admit you know things unlock

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.560
regionally but

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.210
I'd say I still think it's a silly

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.550
practice just to release it all at once

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:41.790
you know if it's a retail product and

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.529
you've got to fight you know you know

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.120
Game Stop is like I don't want this to

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:46.410
be available on Steam eight hours

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.300
earlier than it's available in our

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.260
storefront I can understand that even

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.250
though I do think it's kind of

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:55.020
antiquated but come on HBO this is the

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.500
perfect opportunity to mark it and I

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.550
genuinely really really like HBO you

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.990
know when you get on an airplane and

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.390
they got the TV section and it goes like

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.310
comedy-drama Air Canada has an HBO

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.779
section it's like if I'm on a flight

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.400
that I've already watched two movies on

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:13.860
that's the first section I click on what

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:15.510
do you got I'll watch it but you've got

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.370
a game of Thrones is the perfect

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:21.330
opportunity to market your service as

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:24.150
like a little Netflix to it to a more

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.740
savvy and younger generation you're

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.730
really dropping the ball here by making

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.170
me wait like it's the freaking Stone Age

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.360
now the obvious counter arguments that

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:35.790
is like old blue baby it's the way to L

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.589
is through TV show that's a very

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.530
dismissive way to look at things in you

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:42.540
know your bones will be blown away on

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:45.360
the ashes of the Mad Max

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.850
Mad Max esque Apocalypse although I will

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.730
say I love the idea of a Mad Max that's

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:54.900
the mask by Jim Carrey in a Mad Max

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.950
universe consider it just give it a shot

00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.870
that's all I ask

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:02.040
greenlight it make it right now that's a

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.710
very bad way to look at things because

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.530
on Netflix just move out when it's out

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.570
its out your competitors are leaving you

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.970
behind here you do have one competitive

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:16.350
advantage though you got Game of Thrones

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:18.270
use it Quinn use I say this is somebody

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.150
you just sent you 18 Canadian dollars

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:23.580
this month to watch effectively four

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.839
episodes of Game of Thrones that's a

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.550
high premium to pay to watch a

00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:27.959
television show but you know what not

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.740
everybody's going to think it's worth it

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:33.590
I think it's worth it

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.990
and if I'm thinking like this you got to

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:41.390
ask yourself you know what is what is

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:44.590
the public and large thing pricing

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:47.060
yourself out of the market with this

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.950
with this ridiculous strategy but mostly

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.500
I'm just jealous that other people get

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.660
to watch it first for reasons that I

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.030
feel are illegitimate it also means that

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.320
I can't check the skype messages for my

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.640
friends until 9 p.m. Pacific Standard

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.500
Time when I finished the episode because

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.820
who knows if you know someone's just

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.650
going to pop in there think of me we're

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.860
all watching the episode simultaneously

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:09.350
and go Oh Jon Snow actually became Jon

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.750
fire when the zora I came back from the

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:17.500
dead and Klingon Bowl get hype hype

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:21.920
confirmed like I got a self-police now

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:25.280
it's your little finger police they have

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:29.480
come for your on Wed knees kicks like a

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:33.080
weird dead kennedys mixed with the Game

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:38.800
of Thrones reference King's Landing

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.800
uber alles King's Landing uber around

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.670
anyway is that that's like a four

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.850
thousand view YouTube video that one's

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:50.120
going nowhere let's be honest Oh how's

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:52.430
this run looking well actually really

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.440
good except for our HP and that's a very

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.180
common NL concern because I'm throwing

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.460
my HP away on deals with the devil that

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.320
don't necessarily garner anything for us

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.580
but you know we have roughly I think we

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.160
have like eight and a half damage I've

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:07.130
taken a little damage on this floor we

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:12.020
have no space bar item that's a positive

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:13.610
followed by a negative we have no HP but

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.260
we do have dark bomb but negative luck

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:20.120
is going to mean that we're probably

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:21.740
less likely to have dark bomb payout

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:26.240
than I'd like because we're not going to

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.980
get as many red hearts probably but it

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.420
can happen get some spirit hearts there

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.420
thanks very much

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.260
we have a key I think we should pop hey

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.270
what are we on here

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.640
bloody caves - okay so we're like right

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:42.480
on schedule I think we should take this

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.740
thank you for the half red heart we

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.720
don't need that card yeah take two of

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.860
diamonds with I don't even think we

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.570
should go to the shop on this floor I

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.730
think we should save the key and this is

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.190
like I'm in full-on using my brain for

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.450
actual Isak acumen at the moment see

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.850
what we get in here and then you know

00:13:54.450 --> 00:14:05.850
play our cards right let's go that's

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:07.980
terrible we should use here's why we

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:13.380
shouldn't spend I want to get everything

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:15.510
I want it all and the easiest way for us

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.920
to do that is to make sure that we have

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.470
enough money to get an arcade on the

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.550
final floor well also you know having

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.380
enough money to hopefully donate a

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.700
little bit and you know amp up our shops

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.200
or these get closer to amping up our

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.970
shops and this actually gives us the

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.110
leeway of which we were so desirous

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:35.340
fantastic what helps you watch on idea

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:38.040
what it was HBO have it's Curb Your

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.690
Enthusiasm if I travel back in time I

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.820
can watch the Larry Sanders show one of

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:45.480
my you know if by the way if you got

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.070
it's time and I'm pressing that because

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.870
I have respect for your time there's

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.580
unlimited media out there today we

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.860
talked about us on the analyst that's

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.800
many many times but there's literally

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:58.710
used to be you know in like the year

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.500
2003 it was like you have to watch this

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.040
TV show because 90% of TV shows are

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.720
garbage

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:08.640
so this one's not garbage you got to see

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:12.030
it this is why like everybody in my peer

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:15.150
group watched Arrested Development you

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:17.130
know it was a good comedy on television

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:20.700
like primetime television what is going

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:22.050
on the breath of fresh air we're spoiled

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.480
now I'm going to say you're spoiled now

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.410
but I know that was I'm spoiled now as

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.230
well oh look

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.880
80% of TV is great and look at the

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.980
reviews for a TV show if it's like oh

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.790
the average 491 I'm like put it on the

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.120
maybe pile

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.120
right

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.160
we're in a golden age so I have respect

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:46.070
for your time I hate when people it's

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.510
totally fine to recommend something but

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:51.830
then when they check back later in that

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:53.660
exit you watching nah I haven't seen it

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.550
literally what you've given me is late

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.230
you should really watch let's say

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.940
Breaking Bad as an example you should

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.860
watch Breaking Bad it's a wonderful show

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.660
you know Breaking Bad is a wonderful

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.060
show because the internet has not had

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:08.450
Breaking Bad backlash yet you know how

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.580
good a media property has to be to be

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.290
universally beloved and not have edge

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.760
lords come out of the woodwork and be

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.350
like well actually it's not that they

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.070
solo they stole a lot of the ideas from

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.170
you know

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.320
bla bla bla you the idea that's how good

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.880
it is is that it is conquered cynicism

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.670
mostly that's all you can ever ask for

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.900
that's incredible

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.070
if I said hey you should watch Breaking

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.390
Bad and then three months later I come

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.070
back and I go how about that Breaking

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.170
Bad and you go I didn't watch it I have

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:36.820
no right to be you know even the

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:39.080
slightest bit perturbed there's like

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.600
technically six seasons of Breaking Bad

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.640
every episode is like an hour long I

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.440
just gave you like a thirty hour task

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.540
and then we're supposed to just be like

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:52.430
thanks for the recommendation that's a

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:54.320
long task it's enjoyable admittedly but

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.580
you know again oh sorry I can't watch

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.110
Breaking Bad I'm already watching these

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.760
other shows that God put on my to-do

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.760
list because somebody else recommended

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.370
them how I feel when people recommend

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:08.930
you know I watched 1995 ghost in the

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:10.850
shell' and I watched your name Kim you

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.610
know Gnawa I watched spirited away and

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:17.300
then people started coming out of the

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:19.850
woodwork and they're like you know you

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:22.209
should watch like this 38 season anime

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:25.160
and I'm like that's you would it's not

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:27.410
possible you've unlocked necropolis

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.650
that's the first time we fought sup the

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:34.430
gate I guess we should go back to the

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:36.410
item room I've seen I've seen a few more

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.450
animated movies sometimes I call I go a

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.070
listen anime oh would you see let's look

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:42.410
ghost in the shell' oh well that's not

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:46.260
an anime that's just a Japanese animated

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:50.130
movie no winning is there I'm just

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.170
sarcastic mostly but I don't know I feel

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.090
like recommendations made more sense

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.540
when I was younger because a lot of

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:59.550
media without a lot some media was trash

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.140
if you ever go back like the 1980s look

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.730
at like rotten tomato scores and stuff

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.830
like that I know I know we Rotten

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.780
Tomatoes but anyway I digress you know

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.710
there are a lot of movies that were just

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.480
garbage

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.360
they've got like wide theatrical

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:15.690
releases that never happens anymore but

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:18.930
it happens ran orally now and I'm not

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:21.630
talking about movies that are like you

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.020
know transformers I'll go to bed for

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:27.360
railing on transformers I hate it

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:29.910
however transformers has some appeal to

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.030
certain group of society I thought my

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.470
movies like Avalanche famously Lampoon

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.900
on this new season in Mystery Science

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.910
Theater 3000 by the way if you get

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.950
twenty hours and you enjoyed the earlier

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.620
seasons of Mystery Science Theater don't

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.940
hesitate the new season I was as

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.500
skeptical as anybody else that a

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.900
rebooted Mystery Science Theater would

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.260
have the same level of charm it totally

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.600
works

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:55.680
like I'm not even telling like it

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.480
doesn't 80% work after like the first 15

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.440
minutes of the first episode it is just

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.840
Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyway

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.540
slide my Avalanche movie nobody asked

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.910
for it nobody likes came out probably in

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.990
like you know fifteen hundred theaters

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.300
that doesn't happen that much anymore

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.840
maybe new underworld movies oh I'm sorry

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.840
I'm sorry

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:21.810
anyway I'm just I don't know where I

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.580
came up with this place or whoa I got on

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.340
this tangent I just said media

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.260
recommendations I get like really I

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.170
guess I get really Larry David II about

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:33.630
because it's just too much there's too

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.940
much to watch I was there with like when

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.130
I was with my parents like three weeks

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.330
ago kept asking have you seen this show

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.090
have you seen this show have you seen

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.500
this show eventually I had to just

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.970
basically come out with like a blanket

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.000
statement and be like I haven't seen any

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:52.179
shows i watch Game of Thrones

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.830
I watched admittedly like seven seasons

00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:56.380
of The Good Wife over the course of 18

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.419
months and I enjoyed almost every darn

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:02.890
minute of it except after season five of

00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:06.700
Tanks pretty badly anyway and then I

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:10.360
watch whatever movie the space channel

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:12.450
has on between the hours of 8:00 to like

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.309
1:00 a.m. on Friday nights

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.450
that's my level of program censor I

00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:17.590
watched the first three seasons of

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:22.960
orange is the new black but that was

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:27.159
like three years ago now I'm not above

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:29.679
media you know I know what I like I

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:33.610
think I don't know dude I ate this I

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:35.140
paid it forward for me to get something

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.390
out of this donation machine we've

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.190
effectively got more than 51 cents I

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:42.280
know it says we've got 51 cents that's a

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:44.260
lie we have more than 51 cents because

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.650
we have the two of diamonds but they

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:53.830
won't let me donate so now I feel

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:55.630
compelled against my will now we got

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.210
some do the rapid fire here though I

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.490
feel compelled against my will to go to

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.200
the hush fight just so I can donate this

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.000
ridiculous sum of money I'm just going

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.059
to level with you we don't really have

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.539
the kind of run where it's like

00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:12.669
guaranteed that we can beat the hush why

00:21:10.539 --> 00:21:14.230
did I think that we had 10 damage when

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:15.909
we have oh you know what we have good

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.190
damage but we haven't been hit on this

00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:21.940
floor so bloody loss hasn't pockets and

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:23.679
we've got liberty cap giving us skinny

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.270
odd mushroom which is a damage downgrade

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:27.429
so that's that's our problem right there

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.840
take the negative dude absolutely takes

00:21:27.429 --> 00:21:32.380
in robes I think that gives us the Whore

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:35.020
of Babylon state we don't want any of

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.930
that that's junk look for tinted rocks

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.950
and then run

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.690
well actually you know what it's not

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.840
junk because the unicorn horn is not

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:45.310
that good I'd rather teleport and then

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.590
possibly I mean I do want to keep that

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.120
room but possibly get an arcade although

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.420
I can't see how much HP we have right

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.870
now we know we have at least three black

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:59.890
cards backing us up so we can gamble on

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:02.520
a blood bank a little bit to see if we

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:05.710
get Whore of Babylon hedge our bets

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.820
actually we're at maximum HP so I don't

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.460
know what I was worried about I was too

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.840
busy focusing on you know media I don't

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.270
think it's selfish to give a media

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.770
recommendation if you flash back to an

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.860
episode of the NL SS I think I actually

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.920
said it's selfish to give a media rip

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:24.100
recommendation but that's just because

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:27.670
I'm playing a you know characterized

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:29.440
version of myself on the analyst s you

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:34.900
know I'd take my opinions extrapolated

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:37.000
them to the extreme however I still you

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:41.710
know whenever someone goes you should if

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.540
someone goes you should watch this and I

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.130
tune it out usually it's just too much

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.170
I might have say watching TV is too much

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:49.720
work that's an intellectually dishonest

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.900
distillation to my point I'm just saying

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.800
that watching things takes a long time

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.420
you know if you're like you should watch

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.340
those movies two hours long that's

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.540
easier to sell me on there's a lot of

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.590
movies that fit the bill there for me

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:05.680
I've never seen the Shawshank Redemption

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:07.540
I just put it on never seen Schindler's

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.860
List just put it on I haven't gotten

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.180
around to it but you know you just put

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.680
it on and nourish it will carry you the

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:17.950
rest of the way but when it comes to

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:20.020
like TV shows I feel like everybody

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.580
disagrees with me on this point but then

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.050
if someone were to recommend them a book

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.180
they'd immediately be like I don't have

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.380
that kind of time all you should really

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.180
read like is then in the art of

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.460
motorcycle maintenance recommending a

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.390
book what are you talking about that's

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.820
ridiculous

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.020
I'm talking about television here I

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.700
don't think television rots your brain

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.620
I'm just saying they're in the same

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.010
ballpark in terms of time investment at

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.010
this point

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:48.330
I've also never read zen and the art of

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:50.520
motorcycle maintenance but I know a lot

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:55.500
of people who have I'm not sure it's the

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:58.590
kind of book for me but I could be wrong

00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:02.250
it is it is well-loved for a reason I'm

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:05.130
judging it based on a based on an

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:11.640
indirect access anyway what am I even

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:15.480
talking about dude I still I'm kind of

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:20.280
amazed that there's like no Netflix for

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.150
audiobooks everybody's jumping out of

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.200
their chair right now what about

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:27.720
audibles audibles I have inaudible

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.720
accounts and I buy things on audible I'm

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:34.380
listening to a book right now called

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:36.150
algorithms to live by it's interesting I

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.070
give it I probably give it a three you

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.260
know tying into a previous discussion I

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.460
didn't if you went oh my god just

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.860
remember I don't think three is a bad

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.270
score three is like worth I'm not

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.420
disappointed that I spend my time

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:51.750
listening to this anyway

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.760
audible is not quite there you feel like

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.200
you know maybe I'm missing it but I'm

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.740
buying books a la carte and they're

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.740
pretty pricey

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:05.610
maybe like the book publishing industry

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:07.740
you know they have banded together to

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.480
form like an anti Netflix of books

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.620
cartel to keep revenues high I don't

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.059
know maybe maybe not I don't know

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.250
anything about this side of the industry

00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:16.050
let's be honest I've also never been

has Soylent done it yet

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.780
Soylent will do it for me because I

don't have the Soylent to contain I

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:38.620

that there's a true Tomo who's sleeping

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.250
under doodoo oh did you do all the other

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.250
donate exactly two cents

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.549
sure

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:18.400
okay basically trash we don't have many

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:20.650
flies let's go for $3 bill do we have

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:26.920
keys for sale yes we do

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:28.660
yeah this is a Nintendo thing is it

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:34.230
because I have said the f-word in videos

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:34.230
before whoa that's a shots being a half

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:41.270
the charge bars are very strange with

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.160
this I guess I just have to wait for the

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.030
charge bar to appear and then the shot

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:52.760
to fire

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:53.780
I got a rhythm now like Rodgers and

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:59.660
Hammerstein oh wait

00:27:53.780 --> 00:28:01.790
Gershwin holland-dozier-holland - one

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:07.520
drop on Sonoma load explode on Edward

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:12.980
Hawthorne please I'm not going to use

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:14.750
all of our magic fingers plays yet I

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.240
want to use them of course but I'm not

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.500
going to use them until we've taken as

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.080
much damage as it looks like we're

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.960
likely to take and then I can use them

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:27.470
to be more efficient every single time

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.820
instead of taking you know no half

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.610
measures is what I'm trying to get at

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.870
here and now who the heck is

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.940
holland-dozier-holland uh

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:40.310
holland-dozier-holland you recognize

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:43.090
this Goong Goong Goong Goong that's

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:45.220
right the be my baby drum intro

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:48.220
popularized by songwriters

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.220
holland-dozier-holland

00:28:50.320 --> 00:29:01.870
Motown songwriters in the 1960s or as I

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:04.480
like to call it the 70th the seventh

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:06.460
decade there you go see what is joking

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.290
there about you know it's always it's

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.730
strange to learn it as a kid when you're

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:13.870
like the eighteen hundred's of the 19th

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:17.770
century what a country we don't call the

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:20.190
70s that you know the eighth decade the

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:22.630
eighth decade of the 20th century

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.770
actually sometimes documentaries do that

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:31.060
when they're trying too hard

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:36.630
magic fingers did nothing for us here we

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:36.630
could still die we're fighting back

00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:48.530
we really shouldn't oh we can fire like

00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:50.330
crazy now great shot

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:52.010
can't deny it kind of getting mine

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.610
flooded by the number of objects on the

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.610
screen right now

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:02.630
help okay starting to get a little

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.070
afraid oh look at that damage bonus oh

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.640
that was like the terminal damage but

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.640
huge

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:18.530
we're gonna get it we're gonna get it

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:20.210
and not in like a gonna get it like

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.950
we're gonna die and be punished sorta

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:25.000
way let's go hey thanks for watching

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:28.340
enjoy yepez old wait wait we still going

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.230
I'm not going to the Delirium fight I'm

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.470
not going I forgot this doesn't end it

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:34.630
anymore because we've unlocked this

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.830
where do you think you're going mr.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.840
really we're still in a good spot I wish

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.580
I hadn't taken so much damage but it was

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.820
unintentional it's not like I just got

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.650
super lazy about it literally my brain

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.970
could not process the number of flashing

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:56.360
lights they're Moore's law does not

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:58.730
apply to me the only law that applies to

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.549
my brain is Alan Moore's law which is

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:04.419
the law that your protagonist should

00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:07.070
always be a relatively bad dude himself

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:09.710
to call into question you know the moral

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:18.049
fiber of characters as being black and

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:19.760
white actually like want to lower our

00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:24.950
shot speed by a factor of about a

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:27.020
thousand we could get to the point where

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:29.590
our shots actually hung out on top of

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:34.299
enemies hitboxes for longer than like a

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.299
millisecond would be a very happy boy

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.990
thank you for the HP I do appreciate it

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:46.020
you know what thank you for the HP yet

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:48.390
again we struggled a little bit on the

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.100
hush fight but apart from that very very

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.930
solid run and you know what we've been

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.340
getting good momentum we've been taking

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.580
things off the to-do lists that are not

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.290
easy you know a hush fight not easy not

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:06.510
the hardest task in the game but not

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:09.900
easy and I like the I like the idea that

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:11.730
actually lowers our speed excuse me that

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.640
also lowered our speed we must have had

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:18.180
the right kind of mushroom to get a

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:23.340
speed upgrade and that just it clouded

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:27.120
the statistical analysis there I do see

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:29.580
that there's a dark bum gettable red

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:33.090
heart back there yeah we'll probably go

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:35.130
back for that because a couple bad hits

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:37.470
and my mom might get scared and move

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.850
meet with my auntie and uncle in bel-air

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.740
which doesn't sound so bad

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.290
let's just wait it out for a minute here

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:47.220
maybe we'll maybe we'll lose all desire

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:48.900
to get a more HP because we'll stomp on

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.700
these enemies it's easy to kill them

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.420
when they're in the corners like that's

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.420
automatic

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:07.500
be careful what makes you larger that's

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:10.890
no good just asking for like two Spears

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:15.900
if we can get to spirit arts I'm a very

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:17.640
happy boy right now I don't think the

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.560
bombs are going to do anything for me so

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.010
yeah of course hit me up on Twitter I

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:26.040
think it's called a Twinner

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:28.380
that's a new site I've invented and it's

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:31.440
for people who like to eat tuna for

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.630
dinner not just like you know now and

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.940
then Wow

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:40.890
but but like literally every night so

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:42.420
hit me up on Twitter it's an app I've

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:45.840
invented it takes a photo of you and

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.460
then creates a gender bend version of it

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:52.580
and then gives you a yes or no question

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:52.580
of would you smash hit me up on Twitter

00:33:54.350 --> 00:34:02.550
it's a social network I've invented that

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:05.670
only twins and people who love them can

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:06.990
go to so you got a it's like you're a

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:08.040
cop you got to tell me if you're not a

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:12.409
twin you can't be on the website

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.409
stealing I don't give you my permission

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:24.899
so I'm a little scared where we are on

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:26.550
one spear at heart very very strong like

00:34:24.899 --> 00:34:28.140
how much you want to make it bet I could

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:31.830
throw a football over them mountains

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:34.250
however strong doesn't mean that much if

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.250
we got no

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.010
we got no HP backing us up I shouldn't

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.280
have even walked through that that could

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:43.659
have been dicey

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:50.320
watch out you got scatter bombs you got

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:54.399
to be careful about those no red hearts

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:56.080
huh okay okay I mean we do have monkeys

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:59.440
pause so really all we need is to get

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:02.320
like HP and then after we get hit we'll

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:05.500
get HP back at least a few times so we

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.369
just need the first hit there I really

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.369
thought we just died

00:35:06.369 --> 00:35:12.250
I kind of I felt like a like a flash of

00:35:09.369 --> 00:35:13.869
energy just went through my chest like

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:18.700
you idiot you just got yourself killed

00:35:13.869 --> 00:35:21.099
hey but thankfully no such luck see wait

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.660
wait oh you got to be on a half heart to

00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:25.240
make monkey spall work I got cocky

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:28.869
before I knew the reality of the

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:31.800
situation okay we've gone through the

00:35:28.869 --> 00:35:31.800
actual hard part

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:45.410
as long as our speed is high enough to

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:47.000
take us to the other side in time we

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.460
should be fine here yeah yeah is the

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.620
accidental but also intentional credit
