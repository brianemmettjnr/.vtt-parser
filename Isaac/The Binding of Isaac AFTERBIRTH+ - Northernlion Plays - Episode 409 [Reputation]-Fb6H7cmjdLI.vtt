00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.299
everybody welcome back to neuron Lyon

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.780
please finding my scanner plus had a fun

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.580
run last time let's find another

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.860
character for whom we have not done boss

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.279
rush you would you wouldn't you wouldn't

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.010
you wouldn't you wouldn't make me do

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.260
either apollyon or lilith alright you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.800
know what we've been we've been starving

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.929
ourselves on these lack of Lilith runs

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.390
for egg V firm we got nothing on Lilith

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.850
I do not remember and this should just

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.860
be like a catch-all statement I always

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
make when I'm playing as a character

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.469
here I don't remember what the heck you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.210
get for anybody in this game you know we

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.480
beat boss rush as Lilith's what do we

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.989
get

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.270
I got no clue use diaper you stink

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.280
that's like occasional uh stink lines

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.750
that might hurt enemies or like we do

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
poison damage when we touch enemies

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.280
maybe I am something along these lines I

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.899
think but I'm not completely sure to be

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.470
honest with you anyway hey excuse me

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.140
excuse me

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.970
there we go really with Lilith there's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.340
there's a case to be made for E coli if

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.500
we can get some kind of invincibility or

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.930
holy mantle then E coli is like really

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.509
good but we're just looking to make a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.549
good run you don't need anything in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.020
particular there are things with every

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.130
character that work better for that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.340
character than they do for other

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.150
characters in particular for us picking

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.680
up like a succubus or another

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.960
high-caliber familiar is very valuable

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.520
but mostly we just got to do what you do

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.200
as every character I think I lose sight

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.340
of that sometimes we got to play the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.020
fundamentals properly you know choose

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.579
pay attention in the early game don't

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.570
take dumb damage and you and you're well

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.399
on the your way to the races this would

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.930
be an interesting run on which to get

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.610
Isaac's heart but I don't think it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.930
unlocked yet the only thing that makes

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.290
me say that is the fact that we have not

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.990
seen it on the new save file that was

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.340
bad we've not seen it on the new save

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.160
file and I would think that at this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.959
point it's not a guarantee to say that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.819
we would have seen like every item that

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.990
we had unlocked cuz there's a lot of

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.640
items in this game

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.730
and sometimes I mean there there were

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.860
periods in you know having a nearly

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.420
fully unlocked or fully unlock save file

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.140
where you wouldn't see an item for like

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.810
three months

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.520
just appeared to not exist not even

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.860
necessarily rare ones I've said I mean

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.840
think about stuff like the dollar that's

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.840
not really a random dice roll but still

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.670
getting an orbital is ok as lilith in

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.260
fact one of the characters probably most

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.270
incentivized to use an orbital

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.710
offensively as lilith not least at which

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.740
because the second level gives us a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.160
third level every time we use a box of

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.770
friends but rather landing the shots

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.720
with Incubus is annoying so it might

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.030
just be easier on a lot of rooms to walk

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.400
into enemies instead and let this happen

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:08.400
again not asking for it not begging for

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.920
it holy mantle thirty touch that's that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.110
was pretty nasty holy mantle plus thirty

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.350
touch plus keep of meat we got like a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.990
lot of good mojo working our way if that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.360
were to happen but we're not there yet

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.610
we're missing if I'm being real with you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.130
the most integral piece to that which is

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.190
a holy mantle itself as of right now

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.850
that single Cuba meat is working wonders

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.260
for us trying not to get overly

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.730
aggressive with it but the fact of the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.420
matter is that it's really the best

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.040
means we have to deal damage so most of

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.660
the time I'm probably gonna opt for that

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.540
at least right now as long as it seems

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.550
relatively safe take tractor beam it's

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:54.240
uh it's a weird choice because it's

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.130
actually useful for us but it seems like

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.450
it would be useless I was like I'll pick

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.160
it up and then all my shots will be in a

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.280
line well that's not the case is it

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.690
because we're shooting with Incubus

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.550
which is not affected by tractor beam

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.770
apparently which I should have known at

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.650
this point it seems like a relatively

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.180
safe inference to make however it does

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.390
give us the tiers upgrade and the range

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.190
upgrade regardless so something to be

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.049
said for that a plus two or to get in

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.740
this case I guess minus two tiers change

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.350
is really really good that is better I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.240
would say by a good margin than the

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.240
average item

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.039
so I am not gonna look a gift horse in

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.870
the mouth there although with the full

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.970
run rear old if someone's got to do like

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.039
a mathematical analysis on this at some

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.130
point and show me but I'm assuming with

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.960
the full run reroll for a not full run

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.150
sorry if you have an item room with a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.680
reroll machine on it the item you take

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.050
from it has got to be substantially

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.430
above-average to justify doing it you

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.720
unlock something from the future Steven

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.080
if you're an audio listener you probably

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.000
think that makes me a genius but there's

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.150
a picture of Steven on the prompt so

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.660
makes sense well you know what we have

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.009
our deal with the angel preserving

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.160
which is a polite way of saying the deal

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.479
with the devil was pretty bad and didn't

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.610
give me the ability to actually take

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:19.250
anything so we basically last floor we

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.500
got a tears upgrade it's not that bad as

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.250
I've gotten you know more experienced

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.020
and Isaac come to appreciate tears

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.819
upgrades cuz it's one of those you know

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:34.220
you don't know what you got till it's

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:39.440
gone sort of situations used to be back

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.990
in the day like the vanilla Isaac get a

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.479
tears upgrade you oh man a tears upgrade

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.000
I really wish that this was HP instead

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:51.979
but we were also so young back then and

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.020
so very stupid as long as this kills

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.729
like two enemies I'm okay it killed one

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:02.419
you know what I've decided it'd be okay

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:04.610
with that regardless but a single tears

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.820
upgrade is probably okay for one floor

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.630
but we're still looking to pop

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.430
relatively quickly here we haven't had

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.880
the best track record lifetime as

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.539
Lillith probably maybe my worst

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.099
character I think I overestimate my

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.509
ability with a lost I wouldn't be

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.240
surprised if I have more stats with the

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:25.669
loss than with Lilith and certainly were

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.380
stats with greed but that's those

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.289
characters even though the lost is

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.199
easier now kind of they exist a

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.130
different a different plane you know

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.659
it's like when you're talking about

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.729
who's your favorite Tony Hawk's Pro

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.710
Skater character I like Chad Muska I

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:43.820
like Bucky lassic I like rune glaive

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.100
I like spider-man Gerry spider-man

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.690
doesn't count he's a secret character

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:55.310
okay use your game shark to get him

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.900
anyway by the way if your favorite Tony

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.330
Hawk's Pro Skater character wasn't Tony

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.940
Hawk it better have been Bob Burnquist

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.460
I'll accept those two bucky lassic was

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.740
like an off-brand Tony Hawk rune glyph

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.310
burg what you Catholic

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.960
he had the Christ heir that's it don't

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:19.730
even get me stuck Chad Muska why you

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:23.000
like him cuz he Ward tank-tops all

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.350
except rodney mullen as well because he

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.460
had the sweet flatland tricks but he

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.590
didn't show up til Tony Hawk's Pro

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.180
Skater for so like at that point if you

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.870
haven't picked a Mane like what are you

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.740
doing with your life

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:36.320
I always you know yet you have to beat

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.060
it with every skater to get the tapes as

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.590
if by the way if you ever wondered what

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.530
it was like to be a kid in like the year

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:46.460
2000 not that long ago but YouTube

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:48.140
didn't exist until like 2004 so if you

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.030
wanted to watch skate videos what's the

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.410
most efficient way to do so well you

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.790
could drive half an hour to the store

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.920
get a skate magazine it might have a

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.960
cd-rom inside of it or something nah

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.840
that's stupid instead take an hour and a

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.100
half beat every single level as a

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.820
character in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:09.280
get a 2 minute video of them skating Wow

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:11.390
amazing that's the way to do it

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.770
did you add maybe you didn't have to

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.540
beat every level maybe you just had to

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.280
beat the final level I can't remember

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:20.300
I'll take Bob's brain cuz we are starved

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:23.780
for damage as risky as it is also very

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:26.780
very necessary at this point might be

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.450
the best way to describe it so got

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:33.380
plenty of cash you know I'm gonna take a

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:36.940
risk on the pill it's fine 5 cents down

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:39.680
the drain really a bomb down the drain

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:46.050
it's not a good pill

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:47.820
why are you so slow dirty touch like

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:53.060
e.coli slows you down not like scott

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:53.060
told us learn something new every day

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:01.199
that was good that justified Bob's brain

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.360
right there I had an order those always

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:04.949
Tony Hawk Bob burn kiss Bucky lassic

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.639
then after that you know I'm probably

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:10.800
like a rune glyph Burt I'll cop to it

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:12.810
Elissa steamer was last for me I just

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.940
you know I wasn't compelled for the most

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.829
part but I got like you know platinum

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.670
trophies didn't exist back then but

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:24.180
trust me thps one two and four fully

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:26.160
plaited if they did exist back then not

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:30.149
three for whatever reason I don't know I

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.620
am by three I don't know why I know it's

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:35.910
one of the few games to ever get a ten

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:38.660
out of ten from GameSpot but I was a one

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.660
two and four boy

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:47.280
and I owned underground as well that's

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.870
right I bought Tony Hawk American

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.720
wasteland tried to like recapture the

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:54.180
glory wasn't as into it

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.180
charm tears isn't then no fear mom's

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.700
mascara is the the fire rate improver

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.310
for the tiered delay reducer this is

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.960
just charm tears which is I mean I'm

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.150
assuming that'll get imprinted on

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:15.840
Incubus and it did indeed but it's not

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:17.460
very good unfortunately now again I said

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.870
on the last run I don't want to be known

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.360
as the guy who complains about every

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.770
Isaac run I'm gonna complain about this

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.560
Isaac run though cuz we're on the caves

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.390
too we're on pace you know I'm not

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.770
really that intrigued by doing boss rush

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:33.270
but we are lilith that's kind of like

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:35.370
it's a rite of passage Lilith is a good

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:41.940
strong boss rush character without a

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:44.760
doubt but our damage stinks dude where's

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.850
my where's my damage upgrade of any

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:54.990
variety at this point we're rolling

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:57.410
Snake Eyes over and over got a little

00:10:54.990 --> 00:11:00.780
tears upgrade but apart from that like

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.610
just sitting way behind the curve for

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.110
where we would like to be now where we

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.950
should be but where we would like to be

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.950
at this point in the game

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.100
I haven't been to the shop E I need a

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:22.639
key kind of just you know we're in a

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.560
holding pattern and that's okay I'm

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:26.240
assuming this floor next floor by the

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.709
way we haven't gotten any HP upgrades

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.240
either and if you're gonna be salty

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.589
about not having any damage upgrades

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.379
that's one thing

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:36.290
not having damage or HP upgrades is like

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:38.540
what did we get well we got a range

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:42.949
upgrade blood clot is a damage upgrade

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:45.199
although not maybe the the caliber of

00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:47.959
damage upgrade like you got a to use

00:11:45.199 --> 00:11:50.329
upgrade we got a range upgrade we got a

00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:53.060
lot of kind of interstitial stuff that

00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:55.790
is not very valuable yet but could get

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.910
there one day I have a hope this runs

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:02.089
fine like we're ahead of schedule which

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:07.339
is weird because I don't see why we

00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:09.379
should be but here we are and a spirit

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:14.089
hard to make up for the spirit art that

00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:18.399
I threw away thank you so here's the way

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:18.399
I see this going you smoke the boss

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:24.470
you get a deal with the devil it's not

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.910
Krampus you get a good item doesn't have

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.940
to be amazing but you get a good item

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:32.950
you're off to the races Wow

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:34.910
we did get an HP upgrade but apparently

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:43.180
deals with the devil deals with the

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:45.710
angel they're on strike well I hope that

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.830
you get what you're after in the

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.779
negotiation process I of course I find

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.010
myself inconvenienced by your your

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:54.050
strike at the present moment but I

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.850
suppose that's what you're hoping so you

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.150
do that and then there's you know puts

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:00.529
the pressure on the Union and the

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.060
business owner to negotiate with one

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:04.520
another instead of just drawing the

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.620
strike out into perpetuity so you know I

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.130
did that's for the time being I respect

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:13.370
your right to peaceful demonstration for

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:14.630
labor etc but mostly like I really need

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.880
you to give me a deal with the devil

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.230
because like for real dude this is why

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.230
it's getting a little crazy right now

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.910
isn't it wouldn't you suggest you know

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.980
what no no here's where we're at I don't

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:28.970
want to do that room I'm not gonna do

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:32.420
that room I'm not gonna just skip

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:34.580
through every room that's madness for

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.589
this stage of the game at least but I'm

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.900
not gonna make an effort do a room that

00:13:36.589 --> 00:13:40.850
leads to a dead end that you're on a run

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.490
that has no respect for me and we get

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.260
mom's bottle of pills

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:47.450
that's nothing dude one makes you larger

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:52.190
and mom's bottle of pills for all the HP

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:54.890
we just gave you I'm sorry for the for

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:57.529
the relatively feigned salt here but at

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.150
the same time we're hidden like Snake

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:01.700
Eyes snake guys snake guys I think the

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:05.860
snake guys is a bad thing immediately

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:10.339
I'm not sure well I'll do it Oh Lord

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:14.410
well like it's it was a really good

00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:14.410
trade if we wanted a lot of bombs

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:20.690
unfortunately one keys I mean it's like

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.529
Alanis Morissette's ironic like it's

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:30.400
like 10,000 spoons when all you need is

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:30.400
a knife like we're

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:38.420
not really is interested in 20 bombs or

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.750
more interested in like one key two keys

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.970
really but thank you oh that was

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:48.439
actually like a really good get and then

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:52.819
a son card you know I I'm gonna remind

00:14:48.439 --> 00:14:55.610
everybody I'm not really trying to beat

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:59.420
boss rush I would like to make it the

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:02.350
boss rush but it's not like it's boss

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.610
rush or boss bust on this run

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:07.069
we should go shop first this is one of

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:11.810
the very few times at this point in my

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:14.329
Isaac playing that I will advocate the

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.430
one key strat going to the shop first

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:19.370
sure maybe it could be greed and will

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:22.509
strike out but you gotta at least give

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.170
the game the chance to to impress you

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:26.269
that was so bad

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.339
but this is what happens like this is a

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:30.050
I would almost say it's like an Isaac

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:31.639
problem at this point this is what

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:36.410
happens you got base damage you know

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:38.809
forty minutes into the freaking run it's

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:41.350
not for him over 15 minutes in but it

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:46.610
feels like forty minutes cuz I'm hungry

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:48.410
rubber cement it's exactly okay I will

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.300
fight the boss as well we got plenty of

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.410
time if we do want to get the boss rush

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:57.500
and we don't want to get the boss rush

00:15:51.410 --> 00:16:00.439
or that even more time this is good the

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.120
left hand is a is a positive get it's

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:04.490
not like the diaper was doing anything

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.959
for us we're at spending HP we shouldn't

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:09.139
be spending I'll level with you there

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:13.279
but we have a one and zero zero percent

00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:16.519
chance of getting to our deal here so

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:21.370
I'm kind of I'm taking out a payday loan

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:23.990
on HP and though in the hopes that we

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:27.920
get something like semi-decent

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:29.930
around the corner here because who cares

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.089
if we spend a little bit more HP than we

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.040
should right now if we got some great

00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:36.019
items coming around the corner well the

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.809
answer if you're like you know a good

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:40.819
person should be everybody but you know

00:16:38.809 --> 00:16:42.019
we're making some shortcuts here we're

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:43.579
making some narrative

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:48.410
Evans's in order to get the season

00:16:43.579 --> 00:16:50.269
wrapped up by the end of season 8 it's a

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:53.779
deal with the angel completely fine with

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:55.759
this well I guess we're fighting the

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:58.220
statute no we didn't have to fight the

00:16:55.759 --> 00:17:00.110
statue what makes you small plus of

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:05.770
range up I'm going to fight the statute

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:09.230
nonetheless reasoning for this is I find

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:16.640
angel rums angel rums angel runs

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:19.309
intriguing but we're really the ones

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.860
that shouldn't be laughing at this point

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:23.779
because we'd really gain too much the

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.059
minors good getting more spirit arts is

00:17:23.779 --> 00:17:29.120
good we might need the red hearts as

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:31.190
well so it's not necessarily what I'm

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.419
trying to get at it's not like it's a

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.570
complicated thing it's just complicated

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:37.010
to explain but The MITRE is only good if

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.200
you're not stealing red hearts to pay

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:42.559
yourself spirit arts like if if you'd

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.059
rather just have red hearts which is not

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:48.289
the situation we're in yet but could be

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:51.620
if we get hit fairly soon in that case

00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:54.020
you're probably maybe not better off not

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.850
having it but not much better off as a

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.690
result of having it but we got spirit oh

00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:02.000
it's early so I'm not worried much here

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:04.429
halos good not great but good and it is

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.639
the first time we've seen our damage

00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:12.770
stat tick in what's felt like forever if

00:18:07.639 --> 00:18:16.220
I'm being honest it's like the most I've

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:18.740
ever seen a strike out on shops just

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.899
item after item that we have no interest

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.210
in whatsoever I'm not gonna take us to

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:26.860
375 I'll probably take us to 370 and buy

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.860
whatever this card happens to be

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:35.270
made good progress on our donation

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:39.470
machine recently I can't complain about

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:42.800
that like maybe the exact optimal card

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:46.700
to get in that situation now we know

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.080
exactly where the exactly where the boss

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.050
fight is and to be honest with you I'm

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.960
probably gonna try to do boss rush

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.429
originally I was actually gonna go hit

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.309
the secret room and use that to kind of

00:18:55.429 --> 00:19:00.260
get through here but I'll still hit the

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:02.360
secret room but I was gonna skip this

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.610
room until I saw that one bomb could

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.470
give us two spirit hearts and another

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:09.710
bomb could actually give us a red chest

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:14.480
over here it could give us a deal with

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:16.309
the angel teleportation well okay the

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.260
spirit hearts I mean let's be honest

00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:21.140
that's the miter the miter is doing its

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:26.260
thing right now I'm sorry I was a

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:28.730
naysayer miter because you absolutely

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.929
proven your worth here I've always

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.410
thought you were a good item I don't

00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:36.230
know why my brain not me my brain chose

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:40.100
that moment to all of a sudden become

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:42.650
like a little bit of a a naysayer are

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.200
you a wizard I'm excited that's not a

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:48.130
good one-two punch it's not a good

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.130
one-two punch at all

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:07.159
over a long enough time scale yeah two

00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:10.590
cents sick now we want to do boss rush

00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:12.330
over a long enough time scale the left

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.379
hand is eventually gonna give us copy

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.450
it's just a question of whether or not

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:21.480
the runs still going at that point okay

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:29.989
so do not bad timing bad timing for that

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:32.970
to kick in do not pop box of friends yet

00:20:29.989 --> 00:20:35.509
it's absolutely pivotal that we start

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:38.249
the next section with box of friends

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:40.379
otherwise we're in for like four waves

00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:44.070
of misery two waves of misery four

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:45.299
bosses of misery we're gonna make it

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.679
through we're gonna have an okay chance

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:48.779
at a deal with the devil dude if we

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:49.980
could maybe get mega Satan on this run

00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:52.559
that would be cool as well kind of

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.779
redeemed the relative mediocrity of it

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:56.309
but no deal at the angel yet okay so we

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:59.519
got the Polaroid I don't know why she's

00:20:56.309 --> 00:21:01.289
laughing when she's dead double Mongo

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:08.509
baby double mini monster Oh

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:15.570
I mean double mini monstro could do

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:17.609
could do some damage just had to make

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.109
sure we're letting it charge up but you

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:22.220
know it's not a problem you do that for

00:21:19.109 --> 00:21:22.220
little brim every time

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:38.130
I expect this to be pretty annoying but

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:40.800
not forever the future is coming finally

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.480
someone let me out of my cage yet time

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.460
for me is nothing because I'm counting

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:52.580
no age it's that what he's spent a long

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:55.700
long time shoot shoot

00:21:52.580 --> 00:22:01.080
nice that'll do

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:03.720
okay keep popping here no joke like

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.460
double mini monstro or like iterated

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.150
mini monstro to be more literally

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:11.360
correct is gonna have ridiculous damage

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.360
output

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:21.030
not to mention iterated Bob's brain at

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:22.800
least four boss rush I'm putting a bomb

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.540
- oh we don't have any bombs disregard

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.500
it's gonna say I'm putting a bomb down

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.000
there because I don't want to get a hit

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:31.200
in the future but you don't really have

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.960
control over that just hope that all the

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.280
Bob's brains managed to pop off before

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.690
the enemy gets too close I guess yeah

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.110
just walk onto the creep what's the big

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:42.120
deal right so got a third level keeping

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.070
meat as well I actually forgot that the

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.640
Kiwi meat was part of our plans right

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.640
now yeah

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:59.370
we're at least it's implausible that we

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:03.140
don't beat boss rush that is going to

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:06.240
happen okay it's probably gonna happen

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:09.030
however we do run the risk of leaving

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.070
with almost no HP beating boss rush with

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:16.500
Lilith is its own thing you know it

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:20.880
unlock something but we shouldn't get to

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.770
where it where's the boss there it is

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:28.440
we shouldn't get too excited over just

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:31.500
that because it's not that difficult we

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.600
want to get like the whole trifecta on

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.720
this maybe quad fact well I don't think

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.650
we can get the quad fact though cuz

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.900
beating blue baby doesn't give you the

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:42.480
online going through that like trapdoor

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:47.700
gives the unlock so if we get mega satan

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:49.860
unlocks we have to choose either mega

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.900
satan or the chest which we would do you

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.460
know dynamically depending on our run

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:57.260
looks but ideally Magus Aiden because

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.260
it's hard to finesse that

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:12.279
Wow the adversary ran into the fallen

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:13.809
and pushed me well pushed his laser beam

00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:15.009
into me to put it more accurately you

00:24:13.809 --> 00:24:16.990
didn't really push me into the laser

00:24:15.009 --> 00:24:20.679
beam that's a new one

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:23.559
I'm kind of stunned by how mediocre this

00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:25.629
run is even after like 20 box of friends

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:27.639
plays we might have to accept this is a

00:24:25.629 --> 00:24:36.490
bit of a long shot but you know we'll

00:24:27.639 --> 00:24:39.340
keep trying laying those Bobby's land

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:44.440
those Bobby's land those Bobby Bobby

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:48.429
brains walks right into it we might not

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:51.070
even be boss rush in fact there's just

00:24:48.429 --> 00:24:58.259
so much stuff to look at on the screen

00:24:51.070 --> 00:25:01.860
right now land the Bob's brains oh no

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:01.860
don't do me like this

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:13.640
the eyes do not belong to me which Bob's

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.590
brain is firing please be done please be

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:21.860
done comes be done oh we got something

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:24.830
and Immaculate Conception is not bad but

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:28.220
we never see it anyway telepathy is a

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:31.970
great item actually a great item we kind

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:35.600
of are chained a box of friends here we

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:41.210
we deviate from the box of friends plan

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:50.080
I wouldn't anticipate great results come

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:50.080
on oh of these two you gotta go Seraphin

00:25:50.740 --> 00:26:01.250
but we're definitely like in longshot

00:25:55.310 --> 00:26:03.290
territory we also had Guardian spearmint

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:08.300
Li and might have like tainted our

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:12.350
experience of Guardian spear oh oh well

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.580
we tried dude sincerely Lilith is a

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.170
cruel mistress but at least we got

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.490
something on this run for now thanks for
