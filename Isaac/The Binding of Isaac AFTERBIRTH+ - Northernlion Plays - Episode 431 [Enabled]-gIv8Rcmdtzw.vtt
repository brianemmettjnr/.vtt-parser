##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.780
everybody welcome back don't know what

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.610
the lion plays The Binding of Isaac

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.590
after birth plus here we are that's the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.929
run we died on in the last episode I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.099
guess I don't know why it says we can

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.490
continue actually because I definitely

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.320
like exited to lobby and maybe I did

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.020
maybe I just altai afford whatever I'm

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.810
not gonna redo that run because that

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.029
would be intellectually dishonest plus I

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.730
hated it let's try a little blue baby

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.250
green paw some blue baby on me that's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.800
not really probably I mean it's not

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.230
necessarily super gross unless you take

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.329
it to its logical extreme but it's just

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.410
more non c'è I'm offended as a result

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.930
of the bit no okay so that's like the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.190
probably the best Isaac play I will make

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.680
today to not die in that little section

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.149
right there let's uh let's play it cool

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.180
here we know what we're doing we gotta I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.520
mean as blue baby spirit arts are

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.990
precious right so oh we gotta be very

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.920
careful we don't want to step on the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.590
button blue baby greed is actually like

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.350
enjoyable partly because it's quite

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.729
difficult so sure maybe I shouldn't have

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.280
taken all the damage that I've taken so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.130
far but it's almost like without getting

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.290
a damage upgrade or something of some

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.759
usefulness right off the bed we kind of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.530
don't have too much of a choice in the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.290
matter you know the chips are stacked

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.900
against us to a fairly large degree I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.670
would say just to begin with here so I'm

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.560
just gonna try to kite the enemies you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.090
know we're basically playing geometry

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.159
wars right now but it's it's like

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.509
algebra Wars cuz geometry wars is a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.130
registered trademark of Bizarre

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.110
Creations a company that was later

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.820
purchased by Microsoft and then

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.579
shuttered like I don't know what these

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.430
look I'm not a businessman I am a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:01.439
businessman let me handle my business

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.950
darn as Jays ed says but I don't know EA

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.810
a Microsoft RAC record studio does

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.060
something cool Bizarre Creations hey we

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.069
made a geometry wars retro evolved the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.360
Project Gotham Racing Series what do you

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.380
want us to do Microsoft now that you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.540
purchased us

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.040
they'll make we got a license James Bond

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.380
game coming out you guys want to work on

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.840
that what are you doing

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.970
have them make you know Project Gotham

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.860
Racing five don't just shut them down

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
when you're James Bond game thanks cuz

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.180
people are too savvy in the modern era

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.270
to buy a licensed game unless it's like

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.250
guaranteed to be good at it just same

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.350
thing you know we bought um we bought

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.990
Max's what should we do why don't you

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.360
ever make us SimCity that you know craps

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.950
on the legacy of the franchise you just

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.500
buy them haven't keep doing what they

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.640
were dislike to K buying Firaxis and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.980
then being like okay the new

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.350
civilization game is gonna actually be

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.530
called sieve with friends oh that's BS

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.160
he was riding on top of the you side you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.270
side he was riding on top of the thing I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.010
didn't think he'd be able to move for a

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.490
second there maybe a foolish decision on

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.870
my part

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.220
I'll acquiesce Cuba meet not bad

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.600
we do need to live through this section

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.160
though I'm gonna make a little bit of a

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.460
bold play here and try something like

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.980
that okay so we broke even which is

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:25.230
about what I was expecting to be honest

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.240
we got a hard life ahead of us here I

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.910
would like to get skinny odd mushroom

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.820
but it's not even close to a guarantee

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.030
that that would be good for us we also

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.030
have no tinted rocks were in trouble

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.490
dude cuz this is like I have to fight

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.959
these guys before the next wave spawns

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.640
and we don't do enough damage to make

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.640
that happen I think this is a cursed run

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.010
that was a bit close there

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.400
like I think that maybe not maybe that's

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.930
not our game plan

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.640
we've only got two seconds until the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.560
next wave shows up what are you supposed

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.930
to do dude okay so I'm not gonna hold

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.780
our forever but I would like to see like

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.730
some deal just a decent item here we're

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.920
going for progress on this one this is

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.599
not your standard run so becomes stardom

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.910
for a range upgrade get that trash out

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.560
of here I'm not starting for old bandage

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.079
an item that's actually useless as blue

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.090
baby no chance sure I'll tell you what

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.930
meet you my little NL it's slow you're

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.660
cheating here

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.550
not really meat is 0.61 damage increase

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.599
you may know point six one by it's earth

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.490
name zero you know if you're rounding it

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.630
that would become a zero obviously not

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.680
if you're following the traditional

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.060
rules of rounding but if you're

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.900
following the rules of rounding that I'm

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.060
setting up here 0.61 damage up is a zero

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.780
damage up an Isaac well it adds up

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.580
though yes so does you know grains of

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.599
sand add up to a beach you only need

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.860
about a quadrillion of them probably I

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.659
don't know how many grains of sand you

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.409
think there are on a beach is a grain of

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:06.860
sand one molecule of sand is sand like

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.720
you know three carbons one but that

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.930
wouldn't really work this is it four

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.180
carbons four hydrogen's no that's

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.070
methane I tricked you congratulations if

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.630
you said yes see me in my office because

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.820
you just flunked your organic chemistry

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.199
class you got to switch majors it is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.120
giving us a leg up on the competition

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.259
though I also think we might have a leg

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.060
up on the competition because we're

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.630
fighting like much easier enemies this

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.680
time than we did last time I mean those

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.830
spiders are so sneaky got very lucky to

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.970
be against a little bit of a weaker

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.530
class of villain here I think not a

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.419
hundred percent like there's still some

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.009
still some jerks in the pool here but it

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.229
was much much easier we actually have

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.449
more HP than we had when we started our

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.800
last run at the end of that so lucky us

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.570
I to be honest with you I almost wanted

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.260
to just buy taro cloth straight out but

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.860
we should check our item room

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.460
it's not very good it's a very modest

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.180
helper

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.590
but I will say taro cloth is probably

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.840
worth taking here because there's so

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.520
many different wind conditions that you

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.040
can get as a result of having taro

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:28.920
cloths so I think for now champion rag

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:31.440
man not my ideal enemy to be facing no

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.300
just get him oh we got lucky I don't

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.700
like that this guy creates spiders when

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.440
his head dies because that it's just

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.860
gonna slow us down enough that we can't

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.450
maybe bounce him over and over but

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.760
managed to get through that and then we

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.580
got Duke of flies this is perfect du

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.860
Kiev he's got no problem written all

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.820
over his forehead like Jared Leto's

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.850
damaged tattoo in the 2016 film Suicide

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:01.220
Squad now

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.220
taro cloth leaves us with eight cents

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.710
assuming we don't get like a two of

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.940
diamonds or something like that but it

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.340
leaves us with eight cents what do you

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.920
do after that we could do a number of

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.090
different things we could buy a key we'd

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.190
probably wait till the next floor but

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.300
we'd get a key for our next item room so

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.720
we could start the next floor with two

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.610
items instead of one we could possibly

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.270
buy a spirit heart which I also think is

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.920
viable we could also go to the curse

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.150
room and then buy a spear at art to make

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.620
up the difference but let's see what we

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:34.650
start with your strength card if we're

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:37.110
gonna use a doubled strength card as a

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:41.220
result of taro cloth we should probably

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.810
wait until the next floor and then do

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.200
all the waves at once because it's kind

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.150
of like getting to magic mushes in fact

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.700
it might literally be getting to magic

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.990
mushes so we might as well take full

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.120
advantage of that even though this wave

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.440
you know there's no love loss for

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.270
fighting these enemies with our current

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.960
stats so the thing with greed mode is

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:03.630
that you know although greed once you

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.450
get some money is easier I think almost

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.220
every greed mode run tends to start a

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.620
little harder than your average regular

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.270
mode run like the curve I wish I had

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.000
like a camera on right now cuz the curve

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:17.700
for a regular run is like it starts

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.170
usually kind of medium

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.760
and then it gets a little bit easier

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.860
it's like a little it's the bunny hill

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.290
at a ski resort or something you know

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.150
you get on and it's like momentum just

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.670
carries you all the way down most of the

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.200
time we're all the way up sometimes and

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.910
yeah maybe there's some moguls on the

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.930
path but you can make it may be an ideal

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.990
deal with the devil there let's head

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:42.540
downwards and then green mode is like

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:47.280
it's the opposite like you start with

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:49.260
like a big little uphill you start with

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.880
a big little uphill you gotta climb up

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.350
that you gotta take the ski lift up and

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.400
then after that you know it's straight

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:58.410
down it's like a gorge or something all

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:03.840
right we get a spirit heart not worth

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:05.280
much what we got here uh again not not

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.950
worth a whole heck of a lot but we might

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.540
want skinny odd mushroom I'm gonna buy a

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.950
Kia gonna check our item room right off

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.720
the bat then I'm gonna use the strength

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:18.900
card shears just a lovely choice for

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.030
greed mode saves us an awful lot of

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:24.150
problems if I'm being straight up with

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:28.710
you and even like one greet or one

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:31.230
shears per floor is probably fine in

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.300
fact we've got a super cool like novelty

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.790
build the theme of this build is just

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.350
you know do all the waves without ever

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.890
checking it on the shop and I think it's

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.360
gonna be actually awesome you might

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.580
think and we might do this on some

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.610
floors like double shears right I think

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.470
it just costs us the ability to for sure

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.240
start with the shears available in the

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.370
next floor so if we're already doing

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.740
fine with one pair of shears I don't

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.760
necessarily think we need to go for

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.760
broke with the second one

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:07.970
no no foolin here shears and greed mode

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.920
is like an 11 out of 10 item I would

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:13.399
rather have shears than like Polyphemus

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:16.339
I think especially when you're starting

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:18.470
with a just a garbage spacebar item to

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:23.870
begin with like the poop which to this

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:25.550
day has defenders I don't understand it

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.339
but I'll defend to the death your right

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.379
to say it you get the sensor an item we

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:31.850
just unlocked and we got 15 cents here I

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.500
think we will go for it Sears upgrade

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.990
even at the cost of a little damage I

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.709
mean it doubles our rate of fire so how

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.600
can you not right and then honestly we

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:44.439
don't love any of these items and none

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.910
of them are on sale so my my greed mode

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:50.240
flowchart is telling me take it down to

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:52.069
the next floor and we'll kind of just

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.980
rinse and repeat here this has the

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:56.600
potential to be a pretty quick run and a

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.790
run on which I hope we can donate a

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.649
bunch of money as well I don't mind a

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.029
speed upgrade it's better than Oh at

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:06.920
least in my opinion is better than just

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:08.720
getting a random spirit heart at this

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.819
point we'd probably want champions Bell

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.529
I'm also gonna take pay to win which I

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:19.490
believe should give us doesn't this give

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:22.430
us uh a guaranteed reroll machine in

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:26.839
every item room maybe only if we have

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:28.399
the trinket when we when we go down to

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:29.809
the floor I don't know one of them also

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:32.269
and I forget which one it is one of the

00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:36.620
trinkets though gives us item rooms on

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:40.550
the room I thought it was the dark

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:43.389
Prince's crown but in trinket form like

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.500
bloody crown I think it is actually so

00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:47.389
maybe it gives us a reroll machine in

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.559
every shop either way I mean that's good

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:50.809
if we can guarantee that that will

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:52.339
actually happen no question I'm actually

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:54.170
gonna go double shears build here I

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:55.939
wanted you know we're early on it's

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.949
relatively risk-free let's test our

00:11:55.939 --> 00:11:59.389
theory that we won't get a charge cuz if

00:11:57.949 --> 00:12:01.579
we will get a charge you might as well

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:04.970
you know leave it all out on the table

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:06.529
here I think we're gonna be one shy of

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.540
getting a charge which is not that bad

00:12:06.529 --> 00:12:10.779
we can just you know burn through one

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.779
wave

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.939
and then we'll have shears back but

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.670
worth keeping keeping an eye on I guess

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:26.269
we could also always buy another charge

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:28.850
for five cents but starts Amelia got

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:30.679
another deal with the devil I don't

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.230
really want to fight the angel statue

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:35.899
but I'm going to and my reasoning is

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.980
idiotic normally I'll you know you might

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:38.389
not have thought about it but I got a

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.999
pretty good idea for why we would do

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:42.410
this now this time I am a moron I'm

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:44.089
gonna do this so that we can use the

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.649
shears immediately on the next floor so

00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:47.420
basically I'm choosing instead of

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:49.610
fighting a single wave of enemies that

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.670
might be like eight flies choosing to

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.559
fight an angel statue with less than

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.999
base damage albeit a much better rate of

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:59.480
fire is this guy immune to poison

00:12:55.999 --> 00:13:07.220
forever because he got hit once a little

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:10.369
rude honestly either way one way or the

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.670
other he's going out might take some

00:13:10.369 --> 00:13:12.170
time

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.029
we're gonna keep east though that it's

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:22.970
not like it's worth nothing we're also

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:28.480
gonna get to charge on the shears excuse

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:28.480
me I hear a cat give me a moment please

00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:50.199
I don't like it when I go out there and

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:52.629
I just heard some noises I heard some

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:55.089
like and then I go out and the cancer

00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:58.919
looking around like what us we didn't do

00:13:55.089 --> 00:14:01.899
anything is that so

00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:05.709
so like booger tears pretty okay won't

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:08.049
deny that I don't think we want anything

00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:11.079
else here we're gonna ignore this just

00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:13.119
save our money for the next floor your

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:14.679
sorries in a sack you know you might be

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:16.660
saying NL what are you doing this a was

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:18.699
room I think we should not go to the

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.829
curse room to begin the next floor and

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:22.029
then we should use the a walls room to

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:24.279
get out of the curse room and save half

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:26.109
a spirit heart oh this is exactly what I

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:28.359
thought it would be I honestly think we

00:14:26.109 --> 00:14:30.519
take latchkey it's an HP upgrade it's a

00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:32.529
little luck and it saves us from having

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:34.329
to spend a key to get in here which is

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:35.919
good because we got a game kid which is

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:38.109
pretty much garbage and then re rolled

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:41.289
it into tech point five which is

00:14:38.109 --> 00:14:42.879
extremely good and we'll also take car

00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:45.009
battery and I straight-up think that's

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:50.589
our end game now that we got car battery

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:52.239
we don't need to get anything else one

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:57.039
charge of the shears is gonna do all the

00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:59.079
work we needed to do so at this point we

00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:02.139
should either endeavor to find a way to

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:03.959
make more money or just save all or at

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:06.549
least almost all the money that we get

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:08.739
obviously like a two of diamonds or

00:15:06.549 --> 00:15:09.999
something like that is extremely good we

00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:12.059
don't even need blank cards two of

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:14.289
diamonds because we have Tarot cloths so

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:17.549
you get an outrageous amount of money

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:17.549
just the old-fashioned way

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.500
we should pretty much be good to go

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:27.779
that's what I mean like this run we

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:32.759
actually started pretty strongly with me

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:35.160
but uh these green mode runs tend to

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:37.410
start pretty difficult difficult leap

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.370
they start with some difficulty there

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.860
you go that's a better way to phrase

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.060
that but once you find the seam you just

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.720
pull on that thread until the whole

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:47.819
sweater unravels whereas in a regular

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.050
run you know that that same kind of

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:50.579
difficulty curve is true to some extent

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.839
I'm actually using this not as a

00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:53.910
negative for greed mode I'm using it as

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:55.800
a positive because I think the general

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.660
consensus is that greed and greedier ah

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.209
you know they're like a little too easy

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.730
and you know that it seems like you get

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:04.589
chaos and guppy all the time and you're

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.420
like where's that where's the fun in in

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:10.430
Isaac if you know 100% that you're gonna

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.430
win that was just terrible on my part

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:16.319
I'm here to tell you greed mode with

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:18.209
some characters at least if you if

00:16:16.319 --> 00:16:21.600
you're blue baby or you're like the

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:23.250
keeper or the lost you got to you got a

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.230
long road ahead of you potentially

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.750
you've got a short road followed by a

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:30.000
long hill but you know downhill slopes

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.649
can be dangerous man when you consider

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.149
the fact that you know if you don't have

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:34.350
like brakes on your rollerblades or

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:36.329
something you ever think about that

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.100
so I'm not gonna pick up any more damage

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:41.190
I actually don't think we need it what

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.399
we might need is is spirit hearts so we

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:46.500
can buy like a bunch of those before the

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:49.470
final boss fight if we need to but I

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:54.420
really really doubt that we will need to

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:57.360
so keep this ok so Jesus juice is damage

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.100
I'm not in the business of being picky

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.920
about that Samson's chain is garbage

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.630
don't donate too much but throw in a

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.069
couple rerolls here okay we can get good

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.260
cards this might be worth it a Hanged

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:11.189
Man it was not worth it at all

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:14.120
oh and a judgement card though but it's

00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:14.120
also still pretty bad

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:24.240
yeah okay we'll take Apple and then in

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:26.000
here we really just want to donate so

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.060
we're saving our money right now

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.890
probably should use hangman there but I

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:37.080
doubt it'll be too much of an issue so

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.210
just play it cool cuz we're not quite at

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.860
like guaranteed win status we're closing

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.750
in on it I mean Jesus juice is a pretty

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.760
nice damage upgrade for us and I'll I

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.950
under 8 and over 8 this item

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.450
simultaneously it's one of those

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.920
situational ones is it a damage

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.360
multiplier because sometimes I pick it

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.450
up and I'm like this didn't affect me at

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:57.720
all more or less the HUD it kind of puts

00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:00.270
a damper on that but puts a damper on

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.760
that erroneous line of reasoning is what

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.650
I mean to suggest sometimes I pick it up

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:12.110
and I go this is just like completely

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:15.480
change the game for us either way though

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:21.180
money's looking good you could probably

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:23.720
run like a a bit of mathematics and

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.890
determine what the like most likely

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.630
distribution of donations when you start

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:30.720
with 0 is like when when is it most

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:34.530
likely to break from 0 to 999

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:40.980
on average not the word very likely to

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:43.890
get 999 but you know what it's probably

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:46.560
just wise to go down there with 99 cents

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.240
and let the game you know it's this is

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.340
saying imagine the gathering is make

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.780
making habit which is you know in your

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.250
head you can start to overthink it like

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.380
Olaf use this card then blah blah blah

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.550
he has this card then blah blah blah but

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.720
you know there's a decent chance he

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:01.170
doesn't have that card and you're kind

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.580
of overthinking it so that's kind of the

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.050
principle I'm operating on right now

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.050
sure maybe the donation machine will

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:09.030
break well let's make it break let's

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:12.890
give it every conceivable chance to not

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:16.440
break it and work out in our favor here

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:18.300
so we're on the final floor you gotta

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.540
check this I'm sorry to tell you you got

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.220
to check it and we got 4 bombs so it

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:27.809
paid for itself

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:30.960
as long as that gave us a nickel which

00:19:27.809 --> 00:19:35.010
it did and we got another nickel there

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:39.179
we have enough HP that I feel this is a

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:45.929
somewhat wise decision we've got another

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:50.520
nickel out of the golden hearts blow

00:19:45.929 --> 00:19:53.760
this up spirit heart for the price of a

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.830
bomb which in this case was free so I

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.750
know it was it was five cents for four

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.850
bombs so the bomb was a buck 25 I think

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.730
it's a what one point two five cents

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:06.419
rather literally off by a factor of a

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:08.280
hundred is this like we exclusively

00:20:06.419 --> 00:20:09.900
fight Green Stan shoes down here with it

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.669
this might be like the first time I've

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.320
just ever noticed that you exclusively

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:15.120
fight green statues down here it's been

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.669
a themed floor for the entire existence

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.110
of rebirth and I'm just noticing well

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:21.419
these aren't green statues they're like

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.960
green statues with armor on and these

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:27.510
are green statues in a snow suit and

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.350
these are green statues that fly but

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.370
have legs

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.900
I guess Envy is kind of like its it

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.880
looks like greed it's got kind of a

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.210
similar sort of face going on there the

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.490
troll passaic do you really only fight

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.770
like pseudo green type enemies here I'm

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:46.549
starting to have a theory a game theory

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.549
if you know what I mean

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.450
where the green statues go when they die

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:58.350
the don't go to the Cathedral where the

00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:01.950
Isaacs fly they go to greet mode in the

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:04.640
shop and I see you again as I try to get

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:08.850
a million percent for the second time oh

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:11.900
I shouldn't have left then I was like an

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:14.760
extremely idiotic move was there a

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.440
battery charge in there and I'm gonna

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.690
I'm gonna roll the dice on this

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.180
regardless we need the battery charge

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:24.350
like without double shears I'm not sure

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:27.000
if we're gonna be able to beat regular

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:29.930
like the final boss regular super greed

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.050
as ridiculous as that sentence sounds

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:37.560
because there's like a super duper green

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:39.090
as well so we're at wool reroll of

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.010
necessary I mean we got the bombs for it

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:45.540
well reroll if necessary to get a

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:52.580
battery charge no matter what it costs

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:55.680
us it's kind of worth it finally

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.450
definitely like cannot take that you got

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.490
to give this run a little credit we've

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:01.320
made this work with like no help from a

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.510
deal with the devil whatsoever

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.920
we did get some deal with we got sensor

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.990
from the deal with the angel there's no

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:10.020
reroll machine so i am basically a moron

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:12.930
um well let's look for a good card then

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:16.560
the fool is not that card the son is not

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:20.430
that card death is not really that card

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.200
the fool is not that card two of

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:23.640
diamonds that's a great card i would

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.920
love to take that with us they here a

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.900
font is it like an amazing card so we

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:35.520
can go down to 24 cents without it being

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:38.010
bad temperance ace of clubs I mean we

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.160
could ace of clubs like down here grab

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:42.450
whatever we get two of diamonds gives us

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.890
a lot of wiggle room I really thought

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.650
there was a real machine in here that ID

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.760
we could use to grab a battery but um

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:51.590
well the other thing we could do is

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:56.640
forget the cards start snagging items

00:22:51.590 --> 00:23:00.060
and I hope that these items give you the

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.350
keys to the kingdom the devil that's

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.080
that's the card we're looking for that

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:08.160
should work but I am basically an idiot

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.890
for uh yeah we're still not quite gonna

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.380
get it I'm basically an idiot for using

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:18.240
the shears especially considering that

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:20.040
was like our end game condition with a

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.560
double Devil card I think we might be

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.660
able to make it work regardless plus it

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.610
adds a little bit of a little certain

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.020
junus a quat towards the end of the

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.290
video you know like anything could

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.929
happen we'll probably still win it's a

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.550
fairly strong run can we leave after we

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:39.179
fight that guy I'm not gonna worry I

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:40.380
would rather leave this 25 cents here

00:23:39.179 --> 00:23:43.140
and not be able to get it but have a

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.270
chance to donate 25 leave grab it and

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.100
come back in we're effectively our

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.050
opportunity cost is like 5 cents right

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:52.010
now and we could gain 5 cents on this

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.010
fight pretty easily

00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:01.110
so I think it's much more in our

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:06.060
interest to try to don't do it it's much

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:09.710
more in our interest to try to make this

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.710
work as is

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:16.460
well we got a luck upgrade for it

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:27.679
considering Tech X I don't think we need

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:30.330
to murder those guys necessarily but we

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:31.679
will nonetheless cuz it's it's actually

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.710
getting pretty hot and we're doing a

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:37.740
terrible job of fighting greed here it

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:42.389
is just like not particularly going that

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:44.100
well we're gonna win I mean we just

00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:47.220
we've stacked up enough HP that a loss

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.080
is extremely unlikely but whatever dude

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.669
I'll fight the statutes I think we got

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.659
it we got to kill the source as soon as

00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:54.090
possible you ever played gauntlet

00:24:51.659 --> 00:24:56.549
Legends you got to kill the spawners

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:58.830
before you kill the mobs you kill the

00:24:56.549 --> 00:25:02.580
the monsters that are guarding the

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:04.139
spawner then you kill the spawner then

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.870
you kill the riffraff it's there's a

00:25:04.139 --> 00:25:11.750
basic flowchart that you follow you're

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.750
executing an enemy destroying algorithm

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.700
otherwise you could be fighting that

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:27.059
these little greed statues all day you

00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:31.130
know not in the interest of doing that

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:31.130
you got to cut off the head of the snake

00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:39.009
thank you for not being ipecac shots

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:48.529
okay I've decided to revise my previous

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:51.710
plan I think it is wise to attack the

00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:53.779
keys because every key you kill saves

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:56.480
you about 15 shots against these enemies

00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:57.649
that spawn all right yeah yeah thanks

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.509
for the chance of redemption I

00:25:57.649 --> 00:26:02.779
appreciate it don't want to end up

00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:06.340
cartoon in a cartoon graveyard greed

00:26:02.779 --> 00:26:06.340
mode greed mony

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:19.590
no key oh my god you just turned me into

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:29.759
a cell phone company from Finland cuz I

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:31.110
went no kiesza Nokia I think like 80% of

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:33.149
the damage I've done the super greed I

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.499
haven't even noticed it's been tech X

00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:38.570
damage while I've been farming other

00:26:34.499 --> 00:26:41.369
garbage no keys please okay hearts dude

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:42.869
young hearts spark fire but your hearts

00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:45.600
spark ire

00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:48.179
I'm not interested in dealing with your

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.440
self-healing ways good sir I can out

00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:55.350
damage you I've got a double devil card

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.739
and an oyster card for the double-decker

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.739
bus

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.840
you have been slain you just do not

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:10.059
realize it yet look at the shade of red

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:11.500
you are dude gotta take that blood

00:27:10.059 --> 00:27:14.740
pressure medication you're gonna go

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:17.380
through arthrosclerosis crack dice is a

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:23.679
great pick up for us here we got a zero

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:27.490
percent chance to break the Machine I'm

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:29.290
assuming maybe like six hundred cents

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:32.350
might give us an on lock but I doubt it

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.929
will 750s like the next milestone I'd

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.400
feel comfortable guessing we can't leave

00:27:34.929 --> 00:27:40.919
so we did lose a little bit of money but

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:45.040
we know that for the future now nothing

00:27:40.919 --> 00:27:47.070
the other thick so I'll get an on luck I

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:50.010
mean it is that sort of video game I

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:53.500
don't know why I switch to this voice

00:27:50.010 --> 00:28:00.610
what are you doing Susan vouching Family

00:27:53.500 --> 00:28:03.780
Guy gotta add a little style and panache

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:07.059
here you know I had to do it to him

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:12.070
there we go alright one percent chance

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:16.720
of breakin percent so I think that gives

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:18.970
us a little bit more than a 5% chance

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.130
considering we started at like 25 cents

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.900
and the percentage chance is going up

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:25.080
behind the scenes right now I think with

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.919
the regardless of our knowledge of it

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.750
let's get the heck out of there we got

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:30.610
to 658 pretty good greed mode is like

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.360
closing in on completion for now thanks
