00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
hey everybody welcome back general de

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.480
Lyon please binding of issac entereth

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.189
plus yesterday's daily was I mean not

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.440
very exciting the whole scheme of things

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.820
but you got to watch a young man slowly

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.650
lose his mind

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.500
something something I'm not a young man

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.480
anymore pivot that into a joke about him

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.730
being soldier 69 and it's actually an

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.519
old version of Josh and wrap it up for

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.330
the punchline okay today's daily we are

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.769
Isaac we're going to Sheol which means

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.300
we're going to go to the Delirium fight

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.070
top-score 59,000 30th place 46,000 so

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.280
those give you the balance for the upper

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.170
floors upper force you for the top 30

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.090
the front page there you go upper floors

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.559
is not how you describe that yesterday

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.289
became 198 with a 2.48 percent overall

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.920
finish not bad actually considering that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.329
we did we died on yet we did die against

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.969
delirium is that correct I can't

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.230
remember anyway now that run went all

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.110
the way I'm now wistfully thinking back

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.689
yesterday with all my well my troubles

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.549
didn't seem so far away yesterday if

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.619
anytime hoping that we're moving past

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.390
whatever you know mercurial troubles

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.250
might exist in that song it came out in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
like 1960 you didn't see that you didn't

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.509
see that let's go

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.670
alright good start here so far myth

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.729
isn't 17 seconds we're almost opened the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.259
game it is not a curse of the blind on

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.759
the first floor it's not a curse of the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.110
labyrinth so we can just go straight to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.939
that boss fight we want you can also

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.710
reroll that but the leech is pretty good

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.130
I'm hoping oh yeah I mean obviously you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.869
just take that but I'm a hoping we get a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.939
little bit of a bounce-back daily like a

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.729
daily that's actually very very strong

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.290
or at least decently strong as a result

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.700
of the fact that yesterday's it was

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.619
really that experimental treatment that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.829
cost us I remember that vividly go from

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.140
like a a 10 rate of fire which is

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.460
average maybe even slightly below

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.799
average depending on what point of the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.710
game you're at to a 15 rate of fire

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.200
without your your actual damage dad

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.509
changing that much that's going to be a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.039
problem so we did find ourselves a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.959
little all we didn't get to the hodge

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.300
fight that was the that was the great

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.250
fail

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.580
you're on yesterday's run now I remember

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.770
okay you know what heart

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.700
don't flatter yourself by moving away

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.350
from me I don't need you sure I lost the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.330
heart on this floor at first I was

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.680
afraid I was petrified thinking how am I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.240
going to live without you by my side but

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.370
then I spent so many nights wondering

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.370
how you did me wrong and I grew strong

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.410
[Applause]

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.560
it is apparently learning new things

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.550
every day thanks to the stats screen

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.450
shot speed up thanks to stem cells

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.850
technically makes it better than

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.580
breakfast or dinner whichever one of the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.630
HP upgrades that actually worth was

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.990
whichever one of the HP upgrades it

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.400
actually were I don't know how deep we

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.980
want to go on that play right now should

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.320
let leach do as much of the damage as

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.540
possible to weak enemies because it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.940
gives almost watch right no got hit by

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.209
one of the random bullets that's alright

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.650
I smell a recovery in our future we'll

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.080
go back here we got plenty of time

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.590
don't don't despair yet this is still

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.320
far from being over or even really that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.370
bad although losing 64 percent chance of

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.440
getting a deal with the devil on this

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.470
floor is kind of garbage just hoping to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.260
get like anything okay I mean it's not

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.570
really my man but that's fine alright

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.590
five cents that's good we'll stay there

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.480
for now that's a bummer I just kind of

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.060
shot the fires we shouldn't been hit on

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.560
that room to begin with but but shot the

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.670
fire would have given me slightly more

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.090
real estate with which to dodge around

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.090
slash through

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.240
might have found ourselves in a slightly

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.880
safer position we're hoping for rooms

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.970
with more flies wounds that was really

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.860
good range upgrade is largely

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.240
meaningless but I got to think about

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.210
what we're going to do with our key here

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:18.970
if we don't get any more keys so leech

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:20.620
you eat them get me back to full HP so I

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.900
can go back to that blood bag okay now

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.240
we have two keys and we can do whatever

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.730
we want in here you could probably make

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.650
a case for battery baby even if we end

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.020
up not let the penny behind here even if

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.820
we end up not going with the v6 maybe

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.260
even especially if we end up not going

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.270
with the v6 we can make something work

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.310
there and I can't remember if battery

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.140
baby gives us an instant charge or not

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.580
because if it gives us an instant

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.500
charger I might want to re-roll sworn

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.210
protector it's good but it's not good

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.790
enough to get particularly you know

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.260
thrilled about its existence so good a

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.360
tattoo HP as usual just leave ourselves

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.280
with enough of a buffer on other runs

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.310
I'd probably go a little bit deeper than

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.540
that but I'm going to choose to

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.730
normalize did that to the tune of but

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.400
take on me by uh aha

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.360
aha aha how do you say that either way

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.300
like I don't know why I chose to go that

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.690
low I don't know why I chose to to go

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.570
that low look I'm not a great singer I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.520
acknowledge this in a big way dude leach

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.870
is crushing it right now thank you so

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.669
much we got no problems except for the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.480
whole deal with the devil thing but

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.880
that's okay it's actually charged baby

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.130
and ellas not battery baby common

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.030
misconception ok valid I should know

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.350
that at this point look at that that is

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.320
enough money to keep me in the money

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.000
honey if you got the time because this

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.180
seems like it's going to be a longer

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.250
Daly then well you know at least those

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.510
ones in which it goes to Mom's foot and

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.480
then I make a mistake and don't actually

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.060
get to pick it up in there get the seem

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.470
to get beyond there I'm gonna play the

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.330
blood bank just a little bit more here

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.950
because we can and you know we can use

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
the money to maybe supplement our low

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.370
consumable gain here

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.470
uh not really actually I'm just going to

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.180
give the money to Bumbo I wish he

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.590
wouldn't eat lucky pennies because now

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.500
I'm just like yeah there we go seven

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.719
luck upgrades thrown thrown away which

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.849
is probably not even close to valid but

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:27.099
that's you know the way my brains

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:30.490
working right now that's what I want

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.259
more of these because I want if we can

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.689
get bumble like max leveled super

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.219
quickly or at least like a high level

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.569
super quickly that puts us in a pretty

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.250
good spot now he's going to sell that

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.819
was not what I should have done there

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.430
but you're going to start spitting out

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:48.159
bombs I think so we got to be careful

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:52.060
dude the leech is saving my life and

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:56.319
times right now okay these are for you

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.879
bum buh bum buh probably was not the

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.110
right call like I might have been better

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:03.789
off just sticking with please don't blow

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:09.550
these guys up right now I might have

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:11.949
been better off just sticking with Zen

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.360
max level I think this is a max level

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.810
bubble now I might even better off just

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.340
sticking with the fly but if we can get

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.319
a max level bubble that starts to chew

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.690
up bosses it should pay for itself

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.919
pretty quickly so that's what I'm hoping

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.810
for here we don't need to buy anything

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.819
else maybe I'll get the card just to see

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.199
how it goes and the chariot admittedly

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:30.940
has some good stuff going along with it

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.699
not to mention we're still ahead of

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.020
schedule year but I'm I'm concerned

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.029
about the fact that we're ahead of

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.139
schedule here so Bumbo should just

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:43.180
absolutely tear this guy out didn't get

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.620
a deal with the devil Faire honestly

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.779
didn't deserve a deal with the devil I

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.550
think it's fair to suggest we got a verb

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:50.650
pill which gives us a second range

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.000
upgrade I'm going to head down I'm going

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.430
to keep the chariot card

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.589
am i happy with the reroll is little

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:00.580
Steven into polydactyl why not you know

00:07:56.589 --> 00:08:02.860
it's deep pockets and generally speaking

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:06.219
I think the runes are probably more

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.569
valuable or like runes and cards are

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:09.639
probably more valuable on a run like

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:11.830
this especially when like you know if we

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:13.479
want to fight delirium we're going to

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.020
need like double algae's or something

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:18.459
like that so we're going to we're going

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.479
to need some help is what I'm getting

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:23.730
that I mean it's nice for the battery I

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:28.120
mean we could share

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:31.240
into getting a bomb and a key here don't

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.960
really want to do that I'm almost

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.150
wondering if like if you're this isn't

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.010
like your bachelor's thesis in Isaac but

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.230
this could be like your PhD thesis and

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.860
Isaac on a run like this do you think

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.850
it's sensible to try to respawn hear me

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.310
out here cuz it's going to be a little

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.680
bit of a leap to try to respawn into the

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:53.980
lost via missing poster so that you

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.320
can't conceivably have a damage penalty

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.630
that goes up beyond what it is right now

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.710
you know what I mean

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.180
you might be saying no and I think

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.360
that's that's a failure of my

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.190
explanation if we become the lost we get

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.840
holy mantle if we get holy mantle that

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.460
means the only damage penalty we can

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.680
take is when we actually die so if we

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.150
manage to win the run it will negate any

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.480
damage that we took that holy mantle

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:18.340
managed to block so again it's one of

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.390
those things probably a little bit cute

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.400
but not necessarily sound but I don't

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.740
know we'll uh

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.480
we'll bring it up and then ask smarter

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.670
people to empirically analyze it and

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.230
then never talk about it again that that

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.440
tends to be the way these things go

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.990
that's perfect

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:42.490
now this floor this floor is a big deal

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:46.990
we still have the opportunity to get a

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:50.620
deal with the devil we need to do what

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:53.190
we didn't do on the last floor which is

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:58.300
avoid taking red hard damage before we

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:59.860
managed to get a spirit heart spirit

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:05.260
hearts have not been easy to come by

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:11.440
thus far freakin corn flies man got me

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:13.570
freaking out here help um they they

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.480
should give me a key on this floor I

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:20.050
mean it's only right that they give us a

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.700
key you know I'm doing my part not

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.010
taking too much stupid damage I only

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.990
been hit once played the blood bank a

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.610
lot didn't get any plays or didn't get

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.680
any payoffs out of that I should say

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.270
payoffs

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:34.540
there's our spirit heart okay now I'm no

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:36.340
longer sad but I think I'm kind of

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.420
almost being shoehorned here into this

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.240
situation where I have to

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.620
the chariot card to get a key in a bomb

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.190
and then we'd use the key to go to the

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.190
item room

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:51.670
we got another key okay we might as well

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.900
go to the item room first now I can save

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.970
the cherry cards there might be an off

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.160
chance we can get another they could

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.080
just take it it's not much damage but

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.300
it's it's some and it's kind of like

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.130
beggars can't be choosers right now we

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.640
can save our cherry car to hopefully use

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:09.850
it on the next floor to pick up a sound

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.470
deal with the devil but we'll see really

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.850
like we're crushing these bosses and

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.950
that's a result of the fact that we

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:19.590
played enough of that blood bank to make

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:23.620
Bumbo pop so I'm happy about that but oh

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:25.300
did we did we do the thing I hate that

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.500
we don't want that and we probably don't

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.240
want HP either I'm just going to go back

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.270
and try to re-roll it into into some

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.650
form of DPS or is our utility item as

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.140
well we'll be fine but do we do the

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.580
thing I hate which is where I

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.560
accidentally like mr. Magoo myself and

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.500
having the best possible daily that you

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.290
can conceive of a okay yeah that's

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:47.290
exactly what we're looking for head down

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.210
and what I mean by that is simply we

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.850
skipped the old the devil because we

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:56.200
were bad and got hit and then we got

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:59.230
bridgestone so I'm thinking we're

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.480
actually extremely well equipped and

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.790
this is not where I expected to be now

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.500
again it's always possible and by always

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.120
possible I mean it's either possible or

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.590
impossible but I don't know the answer

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.160
because I'm not living a double life

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.720
like Gwyneth Paltrow in the sliding

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.280
doors here I think we got super lucky

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:21.220
there that that we did not get hit by

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.260
the bomb but take the pill hematemesis

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.050
basically irrelevant it gave us exactly

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.180
as much as it took uh but it's entirely

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.440
possible that everybody who got the

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.790
second floor deal with the devil also

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.500
we've gotten the third one maybe the

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.390
goat head was on there maybe you just

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.950
you know it's preordained basically

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.740
whether or not you will get that deal

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:40.510
with the devil the the chance of getting

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.660
it on the sand screen indicates the

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:48.120
chance like statically if that makes

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:49.870
sense it's not like it's a real time

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.980
thirty-three point seven five percent

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.350
roll right now

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:56.139
for example it means that like when it

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.120
rolled there was a thirty 3.75 percent

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:00.190
chance but everybody doing the seed has

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.930
the same chance applied to them I

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:06.699
believe at least on dailies anyway where

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.500
is this riveting mathematical analysis

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:09.940
leading I don't know okay to give you

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.360
the honest answer to that question

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.889
however all I'm getting at right now is

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.649
that I'm I'm pleased with where we're at

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:20.290
and we might have cheated the system dry

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:23.519
babies really good but am I really going

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:26.139
to take a bunch of items that are like

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:28.750
like I'm taking a lot of bees is what

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:31.449
I'm getting at here and it's not like

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.490
the meme where you take the letter B

00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:35.639
emoji and you put it in words that don't

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:39.100
actually have a bee in them I just like

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:41.230
I'm getting very kids these days but I

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.699
don't understand the deep fried means I

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.010
see them there was that one that was

00:13:42.699 --> 00:13:46.449
like hey I'd like some food please and

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.730
then the guy said there's no food and he

00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:51.100
said understandable have a good day and

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.350
he drove off I mean it's like a sedan

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.260
Thai humor thing but I just said I don't

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.940
understand it back in my day we were

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.949
talking about you know who's on first no

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.899
soap radio and stuff like that now kids

00:13:59.949 --> 00:14:04.810
these days with their avant-garde comedy

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:06.519
then comedy bang Bang's and the you know

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.930
talking tangs I don't know what they're

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:09.430
what they're do I don't know what the

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:13.420
punchline is I feel like I'm the one

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:16.420
getting punched belly button that's two

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:20.860
trinkets I mean obviously we're going

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:27.310
for the guppy dream okay maybe like

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:29.709
don't get hit again good walk there I

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.910
have to be honest good walk I think

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:32.709
we're just going to take this having two

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.779
trinkets is actually really really nice

00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:36.639
even if neither of them are that useful

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:40.000
right now and then of course we're

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:41.350
stoked that we got there we got sin

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.589
robes because now our damage has come up

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.940
a little bit and we will pay to go into

00:14:44.589 --> 00:14:47.170
the cursor we'll pay our own HP to go

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:53.380
into the cursor room I'm fine with that

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:57.760
oh hello the game perhaps was crashed no

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:59.589
it's back baby okay sometimes that

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.600
happens you know how dogs is and all

00:14:59.589 --> 00:15:03.370
that just my cheatengine interfacing

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.930
with it don't worry so what are we going

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.430
to do with black room

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:09.710
usually I mean especially with brimstone

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.899
we've already got great stats right

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.550
sorry we benefit from having great stats

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:16.520
we've already got all the kind of items

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.589
we need we can just improve our damage

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:23.390
and rate of fire we're like set its

00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:26.240
hoping that be there would be bombs our

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.700
key sadly was not so actually we're kind

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.800
of like we're out can't open anything

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.880
else and our score is like below where

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.649
it should be I've taken a little bit

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.149
more damage that I'm pleased to admit

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:40.610
especially walking on the spikes was

00:15:35.149 --> 00:15:42.080
just idiotic but save our bomb head down

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.850
to the next floor basically on schedule

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:50.450
reward yourself with a little caffeine

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:53.149
here we are biological machines a little

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:55.089
bit of that hopefully dials me in a

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:58.520
little bit here because I think I

00:15:55.089 --> 00:16:00.830
shouldn't let it slip by me that we have

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:05.029
gotten extremely lucky over the course

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:06.970
of this run so far to not be punished

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:09.529
and in fact potentially to be rewarded

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:12.560
for missing that second floor deal with

00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:14.390
the devil I mean I really I've railed on

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.100
that in the past this is just like in

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.260
the first x-men movie where there's that

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.050
one senator and he's being like a real

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:24.260
you know dick to everybody we don't need

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:26.300
a was it was actually doesn't do

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.890
anything for us okay I mean that's what

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.290
I wanted to see is like a black market

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.820
basically and it is a black market see

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:36.560
now the x-men analogy is going to have

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:38.270
to wait for a second here honestly dude

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.930
you chose like the worst possible

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:44.690
battlefield there so we actually just

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:47.560
don't need deep pockets deep pockets is

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.880
actually it just does nothing for us

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.459
because we already have polydactyl

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:55.459
they're they're redundant if you have

00:16:52.459 --> 00:16:57.140
the other we'll take the HP and then

00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:58.820
we're going to probably use the chariot

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.180
card here but we're going to first go

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.770
down to one half red heart chariot card

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.699
could be more valuable then we get gimpy

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:09.380
out of it dang dude okay and then I

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:11.480
think I only want one of these but I

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.520
want BFF deep pockets doesn't do

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:18.290
anything for us and black rune doesn't

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.640
either a car battery starter dead

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.590
you know none of these none of these

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.970
really Popoff we already have again it's

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:25.340
kind of like a redundant situation we

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:29.300
already have what we need from these so

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:32.030
we'll just move on here deep pockets

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.650
gimpy really good pickups really really

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:37.570
good pickups just need to make sure that

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.570
we're moving at a reasonable clip here

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:45.020
BFF is going to be exceptional for us

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:47.270
I'm really I was thinking like having a

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.820
max level bumbo is something I don't

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:52.880
think I've ever had especially with BFF

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.050
for the Delirium fight and then combine

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.330
that with the fact that our range is

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.970
excellent I feel like we're very well

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:01.820
equipped to handle a hush fighting and a

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.590
delirium fight now the real question

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.140
here that you should be asking yourself

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:08.840
you're not already is why is this moron

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.310
holding the chariot card instead of

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.350
holding the emperor card that can

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.150
actually grant him access to the thing

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.910
that enables him to get all the points

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:20.060
later in the game and the simple answer

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.050
to that question is because I'm if you

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.680
ask me how I know I'm going to have to

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.680
plead the fifth

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.080
that's what Will Smith said in the song

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:30.770
Miami the theme song for the city Miami

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:33.470
and I'm going to continue to get all my

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:38.240
legal advice from that no that's mine he

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:40.520
got it but Dave he ate a nickel and he

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.450
spit out a Lucky Penny that's not a bad

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.620
trade all things considered we do want

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.540
to go to our shop in our item room which

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.100
is why I'm skirting around here and

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:52.190
trying to go a little faster but yeah

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.230
that's um the reason is because I think

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.680
we should be able to make boss rush

00:18:54.230 --> 00:19:01.220
regardless and that's probably a bad

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:06.470
reason to chance it but it's what I'm

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:10.400
going to do I don't believe that a mimic

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:13.040
can have red chest items in it but

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.020
admittedly I very rarely do anything

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.780
with these mimics here so I wouldn't

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:21.350
necessarily know okay so we're going to

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.870
like diplopia and it's a pretty cheap

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:27.820
set of consumables along with the fanny

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:30.560
pack and then we're going to reroll and

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.410
there's blank card black rune of course

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.150
and you know that

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.700
that's interesting but just going to

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.470
stay away from that for now because I

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.080
don't have time to think about it blank

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:42.540
are black rune is great actually great

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.310
you know what where's our battery charge

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.140
it's one room away we kind of go just

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.670
the slightest bit faster I would kill

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.090
for a speed upgrade but you have to

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:54.210
reroll that a minor just it's just got

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.190
to be done and it's not even worth

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.840
placing the bomb and waiting for it so

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.950
I'm just going to get down here to the

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.840
boss fight hopefully we can leave this

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.910
floor before like 17 minutes and I had

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.620
30 seconds and we'll feel better about

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.420
our chances of making boss rush we can

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:11.270
kill enemies easily just a matter of

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:14.040
finding the room alright

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:16.110
you can also invalidate all of our

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.210
concerns by walking back for the emperor

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:20.400
card but now it's a matter of principle

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.770
so that's really really nice it helps

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.420
our rate if it basically just took 33

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.190
percent off of our tier delight which it

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.290
doesn't sound that amazing but trust me

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:32.310
as an adult you get excited about

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:34.080
percentages like that you ever wonder

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.510
why that Geico commercial took off you

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.800
know 15 minutes could save you 15% or

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.500
more on your car insurance that's not a

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.950
paid spot I don't even think we have

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:46.290
Geico in Canada because 15% is a lot you

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:49.050
know I live in British Columbia Canada

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.360
we have one like that we have like a

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:53.400
weird this is a strange room by the way

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.800
we have like a weird pseudo monopoly

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:59.640
it's like the government provides auto

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:01.260
insurance you're free to buy auto

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.840
insurance from whatever provider you

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:06.930
want but that provider has to buy it

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.900
from the government so you know it's

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.040
like you can't really shop around maybe

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.930
it's a good thing because it ensures a

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.940
certain level of service but at the same

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:17.270
time you're like well I gotta buy it

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.980
directly from the government or I could

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.900
I'll take it two tiers upgrade so and

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.870
knock-back doesn't matter oh my god such

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.250
a minor tiers upgrade but like I could

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.660
buy it directly from the government or I

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.190
could pay somebody else to buy it

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.870
directly from the government for me that

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:35.750
doesn't seem not in neither of you seem

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:38.610
like necessarily consumer forward ideas

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.750
but then you say NL but don't you have

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.070
to buy your health insurance from the

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.900
government and I'm like well technically

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.030
I suppose that's also correct and we get

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.490
into a whole it's a whole thing

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:51.090
who knows so I'll take blue map and I'll

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:53.280
take PhD which gives us a perks pill

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.160
which is good but not what we want

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.450
PhD I just like so that all pills for

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:02.220
the rest of the game are good in case

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:03.900
that's not obvious I don't want to

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:08.850
invalidate the fact that we have you

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:10.920
know runes and cards well knock-back

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:14.490
actually works with brimstone which is

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.470
bad we didn't want that but I didn't

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.030
realize that you can actually apply a

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.130
knock-back effect over in stone laser

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:23.190
until just now so the Hermit card does

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.960
give us a way out of the boss fight boss

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.850
rush I should I should say which means

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.380
that we probably should take that

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:32.550
instead of the chariot and we made it

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.900
the reason we take the Hermit is so that

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:38.310
we can easily go to this boss fight

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:39.780
right away and not feel like we're

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:42.030
missing out on too much of the floor if

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:45.930
we have to go back or want to go back we

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:54.480
can great great bomb bumbo you almost

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:56.580
got him better luck next time really

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.870
looking for damage just got to be honest

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:02.190
with you really looking for damage no

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:04.110
Krampus please it's Krampus he's going

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.970
to die in no time flat there's actually

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.580
nothing to be concerned about gave us

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:10.200
lump of coal I think it's a flat damage

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.110
bonus but that might have been pre

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.490
rebirth okay we have the soul great item

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:19.230
do you 100 okay I mean yeah parasite

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:22.920
okay I mean I think you just take the

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:27.570
soul but I'll admit you know when you're

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:29.610
looking at for stat upgrades or possibly

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.790
of the 100 you're thinking to yourself

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:34.020
there's some good stuff going on here

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:38.160
actually you're thinking to yourself

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:41.580
it's gonna be a long long time until the

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:45.980
Zane returns to Isaac it's not that's

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:49.790
not a rhyme that works in the song no no

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.790
he's in northern land

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.630
does anyone I mean statistically

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:58.140
probably but with anyone there for that

00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:01.560
stream of players the players on known

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:03.680
battlegrounds where I very ignorant Lee

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.320
said that Elton John is the most famous

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:10.500
singer that has the least famous songs

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.730
and then Austin is like what about tiny

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.960
dancer I was like well of course

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.240
tiny dancer he's like okay what about

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.310
Rocket Man Saturday Night's Alright for

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.480
fighting and I was like yeah no you got

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.010
me there those are big ones what about

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.000
candle in the wind and Ken on the wind

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:26.070
1997 you know it's like okay you got me

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.810
on those ones I'm beginning to see your

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.580
point you say what about the entire Lion

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:32.970
King soundtrack and I said you know what

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.980
daddy said what about Crocodile Rock and

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:38.180
your song and I said well you know what

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:40.590
you've made a good point here Austin my

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.060
original comment was from a place of

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.520
ignorance I think that's clear in

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.260
hindsight I what do we you said what

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.880
about Benny and the Jets and then into

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:56.490
response to that I just said Benny I

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:58.560
have some conversational regrets I got

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.630
nothing against Elton John actually is

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.190
one of those artists where you know if

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.920
an Elton John song comes on the radio

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:07.170
I'm like sick Elton John this is a

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.640
classic for some reason I just blanked

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:12.240
on the fact that he's like one of the

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.560
most prolific artists of the last 40

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.930
years and you know what that's why I

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.880
bring it up here well you know if you

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.870
can't handle me in my thirst you don't

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.870
deserve me in my friends

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.980
now this is normally the part where the

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.750
run starts to drag a little bit and then

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.730
I go well the rums good but it's not

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.680
that good but I'm going to mix it up

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.000
today I see the room is great but it's

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.630
not that great

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.600
the real problem right now is the lack

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.640
of capital D damage gins to say that our

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:46.500
rate of fire is actually very good for

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:50.460
having brimstone but we're pretty light

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:53.220
in the where are you ha there yeah we're

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:56.940
pretty light in the in the damage

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.850
category BFF along with max level

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.680
bumbles helping that out brimstone with

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.900
lump of coal I think is helping it out

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:09.480
but I'm not totally sure to be honest

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:11.280
with you and we got plenty of

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.550
opportunities to make it work here now

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.680
are we going to hit 50,000 or even in

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.810
the 40s on today's run I actually think

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.000
the 40's are conceivable I think we have

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.920
been maybe an outside shot but a shot

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.040
nonetheless at like a top 50 rank today

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:28.890
and I say that because we're a little

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.480
bit under our points like where we'd

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.950
expect to be points wise maybe we're

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.350
about where we'd expect to be points

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:38.580
wise but we're on the up-and-up like the

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:41.160
derivative of our points has gone way up

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:47.250
the rate of change is is positive for us

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:49.350
right now I think you just you have to

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:55.470
reroll tractor beam oh ok

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:57.240
smart reroll we will move along now yeah

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.950
we will move along now you might be

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.990
saying obvious Hermant car but that's

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.990
not the right play we need to make hush

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:09.200
which is my way of saying everybody shut

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:12.510
up we need to make hush everybody quiet

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.300
we need to make hush so the last you

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.800
know the crown jewel of a very

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.540
successful run that doesn't have a whole

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.790
lot of damage associated with it

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.620
although now our damage is actually 9

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.900
which with brimstone it might as well be

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:29.370
900 but you know to continue with like

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:31.260
my earlier listen I can see forever pill

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.330
anyway what I was going to say is Guffey

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.430
and there it is so we're just going to

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:37.290
go full permanent Polaroid miscibility

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:40.350
and then reroll it at our earliest

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:42.750
convenience I don't know I mean it's not

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:46.830
a tough call but it's like what I'd

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:48.540
rather have the chariot for another I

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:52.020
can see forever pills well they both

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:59.160
have like genuine reasons to be excited

00:27:52.020 --> 00:28:04.770
about them the chariot is a little bit

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:06.540
more of like a forward-facing item like

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.210
that's something that benefits us a

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:13.470
great deal when it comes to either the

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:18.810
hush fight or you might as well at this

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:20.760
point either the hush fight or the the

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.200
delirium fight and I will do the

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.710
delirium fight especially now with our

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.210
damage popping off and I'll even I'll do

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.830
you one better I'll do the delirium

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.270
fight and I'll do it without being

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.530
self-righteous about the fact that I'm

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.860
doing it which would be you know at

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:36.480
first for the first time ever uh we're

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.800
just going to keep reroll in the d7 is

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.030
playing battery charges in here but we

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.700
might as well wait until we have a full

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:45.770
charge to take advantage of them and

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.770
we'll be happy campers as a result I

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:51.180
think it's almost inconceivable that we

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.610
don't make bias rush or that we don't

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.350
like the hush fight at this point unless

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.570
we get a little mired in stuff that

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.520
doesn't matter like you know let's go

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:03.150
play the blood bank twenty thousand

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.950
times which don't think matters too much

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.390
euthanasia also unlikely to matter that

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:09.330
much but I you know I'm a sucker for

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:11.820
spun I'll take anything that gives me a

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.320
beat on spun in like any situation also

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.870
I think that it works with brimstone and

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.190
like once every ten damage takes you'll

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.650
get like a damage tick that does ten

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.360
times the amount of damage which is the

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.220
statement that I literally believe in

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.590
although it came out with too many tends

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:30.450
to sound cogent from you know a normal

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:31.920
person so I'm in this weird position and

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.570
I'm not complaining it's quite the

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.280
opposite I don't know I've never done

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.360
the opposite of complaining so I don't

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.420
know if there's a word in the English

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.470
language for it I'm sending my

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:46.090
compliments to the chef

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:48.610
of today's run but we don't really in my

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:50.620
opinion and in not in a self-hating way

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.029
but for missing that first floor deal

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.500
with the devil or second floor deal with

00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:57.669
the devil we don't really deserve to be

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:59.200
this stack and yet here we are so I

00:29:57.669 --> 00:30:01.600
don't know if we're beating the system

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.009
or if we're just inline with the system

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.899
and we got caught by a safety net or

00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:06.909
something like that but either way I'm

00:30:04.899 --> 00:30:08.320
quite happy about it I will take a speed

00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:11.169
upgrade that also comes with a pill that

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.759
basically has to be good pheromones

00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:16.240
burp and something's wrong we'll just

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:18.250
take with verb we can close it on

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.929
bookworm but I don't care and similarly

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.220
I don't think we have the goat head I

00:30:19.929 --> 00:30:24.850
talked about the goat head on this room

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:26.830
but I don't think we have it I'd rather

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.870
have two spirit hearts and then even a

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:36.850
burp pill so let's get the heck out of

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:38.620
here we're trying to get to 40,000 it

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.269
would be nice I mean we it would be nice

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.009
to have some HP or the chariot card to

00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:44.639
go play this but I stand by the hero

00:30:42.009 --> 00:30:48.730
font play I think that's a smart thing I

00:30:44.639 --> 00:30:51.340
our next play like the easiest way for

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:53.740
us to get like max value out of what we

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.990
got going on right now is probably to

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.590
use the black rune on the main room of

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.809
the Blue Room

00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.370
I mean it depends the spawn room of the

00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:01.600
Blue Room I would say the main room is

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:06.549
probably where you fight hush in

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:08.620
hindsight but we can use the black room

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:09.940
there on consumables that we aren't

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.360
really super happy about it may be an

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.789
item or to die statistical benefit

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.100
pretty soon I mean the black rune is

00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:19.899
genuinely like my favorite new addition

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.679
to the game we probably want that over

00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:26.049
either of these but it will take it over

00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:28.980
missing posters but the thing is it's

00:31:26.049 --> 00:31:28.980
almost in like

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:35.679
got a try right it's almost in the

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:37.510
credit card territory for me which

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:38.890
basically means like use it as soon as

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:41.049
you get a chance but the high value

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.870
plays with it like boss rush are so good

00:31:41.049 --> 00:31:46.690
rune bag is great rune bag is genuinely

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:51.429
amazing I'm starting to realize that we

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:53.200
probably passed up a chance for maybe we

00:31:51.429 --> 00:31:55.210
could take continuum which is not

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:59.470
continuum but you know is continuum

00:31:55.210 --> 00:32:00.880
reskin oh holy Mabel calls us not to get

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.900
hit there but I got to see what we got I

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:06.880
think no we should take it because the

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:11.950
endless nameless gives us the chance to

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:17.679
get where'd it go

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:20.380
gives us the chance to get consumables

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:24.429
back after we use them which is really

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:28.120
good with yera and black room so there's

00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:29.620
a good case to be made here you know

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.530
what I've decided we're actually going

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.850
to go faster I was looking at the secret

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.870
room and then I looked at the time and I

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.309
said to myself self

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:40.059
maybe you should speed this one up a

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:42.580
little bit we're actually going to be

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:44.830
completely fine till touchdown brings me

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:49.929
back again to find we don't want to

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:52.630
black runes ii-era blank rune blank room

00:32:49.929 --> 00:32:54.340
is back on oh that's fine Yara blank

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.640
rune blank rune I don't know what that

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.590
one is

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.419
doesn't matter Yara we're just going to

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:00.220
stick with the era black room that's I

00:32:58.419 --> 00:33:03.220
think that's exactly what we want right

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:07.080
now we might want two years but we're in

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:11.290
the vicinity of what we want blank room

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:14.320
so a wazoo be careful down to the hush

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:16.570
fight guerra blank room you're a black

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.340
room that's over wanna be okay okay okay

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.630
got a lot of moving pieces here you know

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.720
we can old two trinkets we can old two

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:24.700
cards that's not a lot of moving pieces

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:29.640
you know four moving pieces but you get

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:32.200
the idea I don't know if we can summon I

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:37.270
might as well take all this up but I

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:38.350
don't know if we can summon pennies what

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.460
do you got for me here

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:47.980
I don't know if we can summon pennies

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:49.570
with brimstone so we might black rune or

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:52.690
reroll this this is basically like a

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:54.250
doubled item room now in here this this

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.750
strikes me as a reroll opportunity

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.580
though we might be getting closer to

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.960
Beelzebub little brim is take about we

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.309
could probably force Beelzebub but I

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:08.500
think a little brim is worth more and

00:34:02.309 --> 00:34:09.940
then the stopwatch is grapes and the

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:16.960
pill has to be I was going to say at

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:18.369
least good to probably re-roll these you

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:26.050
probably buy a battery charge and

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:28.330
re-roll again static tears probably do

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:30.040
nothing halitosis doesn't do much I'm

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:32.740
going to black ruin these up like in

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.850
general it's reroll these first yeah I'm

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.869
pretty sure the static tears aren't

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.100
going to do anything for us but it might

00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:38.889
give us a cool to your effect let's

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.240
let's take it I thought it might give us

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.080
a cool ring around our tears or

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:46.480
something

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:48.790
it didn't okay we're going to black room

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.119
now give us a pretty nice upgrade

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:54.190
actually why black ruin that well if the

00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:56.020
goat head is actually completely

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:59.710
irrelevant like we gained nothing out of

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:00.760
the go head being on this run at this

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:05.020
point because we're going to go straight

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:07.270
to the Delirium floor after this so what

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:10.810
are our odds of hitting like 40,000 and

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:14.369
pretty low I'm being from being straight

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.369
up with you the odds are not great

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.820
40,000 actually is plausible but like

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:25.000
46,000 which you would need to get hit

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:26.560
the front page fairly unlikely might

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.350
seem like this is going very slow and

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:34.030
you wouldn't be wrong but we do also

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:39.700
have made maybe like 30 flies stored up

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:41.140
30 flies x 2 x 10.4 7 you know you can

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.770
start to see the damage stack up pretty

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.770
nicely there

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:51.400
once they actually agro if they actually

00:35:46.359 --> 00:35:53.050
agro I think we're going to end up with

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.790
a solid score today but if you're

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.470
watching this and you're like you know

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:59.500
what the heck I did this daily first

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:01.510
often you're in the minority although

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.640
there is a healthy daily community like

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:06.250
I mean we can do the math I came like

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.650
two hundredths yesterday and that was in

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.060
the top two percent there's like 20,000

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:12.880
people doing these dailies every day

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:14.500
just kind of amazing it might seem like

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.220
the daily community has fallen off a

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:20.680
little bit but 20,000 people putting in

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.270
basically an hour a day although not

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.680
everybody's daily is an hour long but

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:26.230
let's say let's say 20 doesn't be

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.440
putting in like a half hour daily to do

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:38.080
these on average every day that's

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:41.140
amazing anyway I forgot completely like

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.460
what I was going to say the point is you

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.510
might be watching this and going I did

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.180
this daily and I didn't get brimstone

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.950
what the heck you know Niccolo bread

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:53.230
mint

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:53.830
well sometimes to the lose or go the

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.810
spoils

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:57.190
it's really the the lesson today is that

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.320
you can do everything right and still

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:02.339
get screwed on the daily sometimes rest

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:04.780
assured you know today you tomorrow me

00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:06.339
it's happened to me on some occasions

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.570
you're like oh why is it this daily suck

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:09.430
oh it turns out well you were supposed

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.290
to do a skip the second floor deal with

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:14.460
the devil and then you get brimstone and

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:17.470
a guppy transformation immediately

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:20.320
that's part of the thrill and part of

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:25.540
the annoyance to be honest with you get

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:27.460
a per throw room so at 35,000 I think

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:32.550
you just have 35,000 when you go down to

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:37.480
the next floor - hmm that's not correct

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:39.760
we have 40,000 46 is still probably add

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.330
doesn't really matter 46 is probably

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.780
still outside of the realm of likelihood

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:48.369
but I wouldn't say it's impossible now

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.470
we haven't taken damage in a long long

00:37:48.369 --> 00:37:52.330
time and we've taken maybe like a little

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:54.700
from curse rooms we haven't taken a hit

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:57.640
in a long long time even like our last

00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:00.140
curse room we had a holy mantle

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.979
pop lock upgrade and not stoked that I

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.420
lost the key but oh my god he's done it

00:38:02.979 --> 00:38:07.460
three luck upgrades from a single luck

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.349
upgrade that's where something like

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.460
endless nameless comes in handy here we

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:16.309
never they care about having a charge

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:17.989
for our boss fight I think so how do we

00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:18.680
maximize our points I say the same thing

00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:20.329
every time

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.940
well I say two things when we're on this

00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:24.349
floor the first is you maximize your

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.150
points by not fighting delirium but I'm

00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:27.529
not going to do that and you maximize

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.819
your points by not taking damage and I'm

00:38:27.529 --> 00:38:31.069
probably not going to do that either but

00:38:28.819 --> 00:38:34.670
for different reasons sack of sacks is

00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:36.200
lovely the an easy way to eke out some

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.900
extra points on this run definitely

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.940
would have been to roll the blank card

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.739
and I'm not going to frame this I mean

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:46.789
this could be delirium algae's runes

00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:48.589
please blows I'm not going to frame this

00:38:46.789 --> 00:38:50.479
like I'm self-righteous for not taking

00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:52.460
blank card blank card is a really fun

00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:55.160
item and it probably would have provided

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.779
us we need the algae's rune since we

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.789
need algae's you might as well / throw

00:38:56.779 --> 00:39:00.229
this get the halo but you lose

00:38:58.789 --> 00:39:03.109
invincibility I don't think we can

00:39:00.229 --> 00:39:04.460
afford to do it and we like definitely

00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:06.529
not for that there's more battery

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.359
charges out here but yeah blank card

00:39:06.529 --> 00:39:13.789
would have been fun and beyond that it's

00:39:08.359 --> 00:39:16.880
also like no extras there doubtlessly

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:18.799
the right choice especially considering

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.509
we had like blank card algae's as well

00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:22.460
you know we could have blank carded

00:39:20.509 --> 00:39:24.680
maybe gotten a battery charge on the

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.039
fight blank card it again and then used

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.390
algae's and been completely fine but

00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:33.529
we're still I mean we're talking about

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:36.140
very very minor things now they could

00:39:33.529 --> 00:39:41.059
have a semi major impact on the run but

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:43.549
I think we should be pretty proud of

00:39:41.059 --> 00:39:45.229
today's daily not because we made you

00:39:43.549 --> 00:39:47.180
know we're not richard dreyfuss we got a

00:39:45.229 --> 00:39:50.089
bunch of mashed potatoes we're sculpting

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:51.410
a mountain out of them you know yes

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:54.609
Close Encounters of the Third Kind

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.609
reference great film

00:39:55.310 --> 00:40:01.800
however the the reason I'm happy with

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:04.260
today's daily is because we got great

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:07.320
items and we made the most of them you

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:08.849
know we didn't just we didn't squander

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.260
it I guess and that's you got to give

00:40:08.849 --> 00:40:14.700
credit where credit is due because

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:19.109
things get squandered sometimes you know

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:20.670
you ever see a child actor make like a

00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:21.690
million dollars when you're 12 years old

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.369
it can mess you up

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.910
you get brimstone on the third floor you

00:40:23.369 --> 00:40:34.230
can start playing like an idiot it

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:35.640
happens so I guess our dream is that we

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:37.920
pop algae's I'm just going to pop it

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:42.420
right away and then algae's gets popped

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:44.460
again not popped again but we get

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:49.710
another algae's from endless nameless

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:52.770
that didn't work and that's completely

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:57.510
okay dude look at the brimstone lump of

00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:00.060
coal damage did you see that I mean I've

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:04.560
always thought not always that that's

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:06.990
just a lie I have known or at least I've

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:10.440
been told many times that brimstone love

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:13.530
of coal does some amazing work but to

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:17.640
see it on a big room like this I think

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:20.130
really drives the point home of course

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:27.119
the first the farther away we stand the

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:34.230
less likely we are to land our our flies

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:36.300
Oh okay so we beat the lyrium without

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.830
getting hit as far as I'm concerned that

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:40.500
means we're ahead of the curve here

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:42.349
although it maybe cost us some time we

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.550
should still be very happy so

00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:48.180
essentially the rest of the floor is

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:49.800
just about maybe like don't pick up any

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.830
items we're already killing everything

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.710
easily only pick up items if they give

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:58.619
you an ability to get more points and we

00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:00.630
may actually be able to be you know we

00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:05.420
can anewhopeee this one the good guys

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:07.790
can win blood bombs is not what we

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.260
HP is obviously not what we want there's

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.040
a battery charge back here no it's

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.850
battery baby

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.050
it's just enormous 46,000 is not going

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:18.320
to happen but we could be looking at I

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:20.810
would say top 100 today not without

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:25.810
question but very very likely we finish

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:28.730
top 100 today top 50 is within reason

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:32.000
again the best way to guarantee that

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.330
would just be extremely sick don't get

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.640
it

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:39.230
oh I think we got saved by the fact that

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:41.240
it was a small bomb fly otherwise you

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:43.970
might have taken a hit there so the gods

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.530
is actually really useful because it

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:49.520
allows us to recover from getting hit

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:51.710
once from a consumable standpoint we got

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.360
another two gods so it's even better

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:55.190
what are you yera I don't know I'm kind

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.230
of hoping to yell like a 2 of something

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.010
but at that at this point it isn't

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:02.150
relevant anymore

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:05.170
basically perks also not relevant burp

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:07.970
is not really relevant either and

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:09.830
crickets head don't don't waste any

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:13.220
tears for crickets head it's a fantastic

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:15.260
item a we don't need it and B we already

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.880
have a damage multiplier so I always get

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.770
excited about all crickets ed and then I

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.950
already have magic motion if it isn't as

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:24.230
helpful as you think you're a font also

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:27.200
good but we can't pick up the

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:28.610
consumables so I don't know what I'm

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:34.280
blowing up tinted rocks for I guess I'm

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:36.050
hoping to find smaller rock no I guess

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.630
I'm hoping to find a golden chest that

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.890
just gives me consumables so we would

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.870
probably wouldn't even take smaller Rock

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:46.580
at this point now there is a great

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:53.090
trinket there we can't fight mega say

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:54.470
there is no mega satan down here I don't

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:56.270
even know if we should bother like

00:43:54.470 --> 00:44:02.390
re-rolling I also don't know if I'd

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:04.610
prefer maybe to have the the holy mantle

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:08.980
trinket two curved horn like the holy

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.980
mantle trinket I think is amazing

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.860
but admittedly endless nameless I think

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:20.380
is like is a higher upper bound for us

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.880
so momma mega you might be able to make

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.290
a case for this in terms of like the

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.740
speed at which you would help us get

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:28.660
through this run but same with

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:33.580
toothpicks honestly so we have yarid the

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:37.900
guys the guys the guys stick with Guerra

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:39.370
de gAHS I guess we're still getting

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.720
points as long as we're still getting

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:43.320
points we're going to be we're going to

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.320
be happy about this

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:49.090
it might not look like it but don't let

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.830
it fool you I think except for the

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:53.320
second floor this is one of the best

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.820
dailies we've ever played like we we

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.320
have played the some of the best that

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.760
we've ever played on this dailies what I

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:59.760
mean to suggest here

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:04.630
sure we got brimstone sure we missed one

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:08.220
guaranteed deal with the devil apart

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:12.010
from that we have dialed it in like

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:13.810
sincerely dialed it in I think if we get

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:15.400
chest we should double the air not a red

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:18.660
chest because it's unlikely to give us

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:23.620
the consumables we want but if we get a

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:25.600
if we get any other kind of I mean I'd

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.060
rather be a golden chest if you're going

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:33.010
to force my hand okay this is what we

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:35.830
want I'm going to yari era and I want

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:37.180
mad consumables out of this we should

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:39.490
open these just in case there's another

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.690
Yaris um I guess if there wasn't in the

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.610
first one there won't be in any of the

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:43.780
other ones good and we got four items

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:46.210
out of it there's something hilarious

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:52.390
about that because I actually don't want

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:53.740
any items and we got four of them but we

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:56.140
roll them all and we're still looking

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:58.450
for it I mean quick bombs might give you

00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.310
five bombs this is the lamest way to get

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:05.110
points but it's basically what we have

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:06.940
to do so I'm going to do it we might get

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:09.090
five bombs out of quick bombs and that

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:12.910
could give us another few points

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:14.320
pheromones per throw per throat I got

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.290
excited but then I realized I basically

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:19.730
have unlimited reroll

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:21.170
is I don't think we should use it there

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:24.770
is I mean we shouldn't use it there it's

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:25.730
just it's sensible to not we I'm

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.530
actually thinking we're going to be

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:30.440
front page today and I don't want to

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:32.390
toot our own horn I'm just saying fast

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.250
bombs was like a hundred point game so

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:37.460
that's cool

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:39.080
none of this matters none of that

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.370
matters are basically just looking for

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.410
anything they can give us consumables

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:44.570
this hurts me deep in my soul like I'm

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:46.280
reroll IM saying i don't even want to

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:48.830
think about all the items that have rear

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.450
old there that could save or losing run

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.920
that i have later and all i'm going to

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.590
do is think back today remember when you

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.350
rear old literally capricorn ipecac

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:59.150
monstros long 2020 like all within 10

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:03.860
seconds of one another yeah I do

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:05.450
remember that we're making sacrifices

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.340
here for it for a chance at greatness

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:09.440
we're done with the floor except for one

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:11.810
boss fight so we should go should go

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:14.120
tackle dead I know I mean what do you do

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:15.110
with those guys I think you choose not

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:20.110
to play them because you're going to

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:23.540
give up consumables suit still useless

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:26.990
still useless after all these years so

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:28.100
we're going to go might as well again I

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.780
mean we shouldn't spend too much time

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:33.320
doing this because we're losing some

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:38.390
points not many but some and I'd rather

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:40.610
not but grab this crack it open grab

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.160
some more consumables grab some more

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:46.310
consumables you got the gate he's dead

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:49.570
we're done how many points flies we

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:51.920
can't take but room Yara per throat

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:55.370
magic eight-ball gives us a consumable

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:57.380
but I don't think it's worth it and we

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:59.540
got it if we're gonna try to maximize

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.210
this is very simple you go up here

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.740
there's three items you roll nothing

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:06.230
there gives us points to the best of my

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.520
memory then this is the end of this

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:10.820
daily one way or the other we're going

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:14.870
to grab this and we're going to see what

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:17.000
we can get out of this reroll does not

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.480
give us points I'm completely okay with

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.690
it

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.190
which one of these was delirium though

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:24.410
that's so that's the real question I

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:26.300
think it's the bottom and then to the

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:30.860
right

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:32.780
so rate today's daily a plus great

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:36.400
potential for growth maybe only because

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:38.420
I'm bad but hey got the job done right

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.580
that doesn't give us points I just had

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:44.360
to check you know same with that alright

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:46.880
let's go finish 28 as far as I'm

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.050
concerned no complaints there for now
