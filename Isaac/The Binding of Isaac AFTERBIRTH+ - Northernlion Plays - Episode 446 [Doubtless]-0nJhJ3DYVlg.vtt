00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
hey everybody welcome back sinner online

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.360
plays The Binding of Isaac after birth

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:15.660
plus let's go blue baby dark path I got

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.250
a I need to make like a template post-it

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.690
note that I can look at myself and be

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.090
like this corresponds to this at

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.279
coordinate uh you know x equals to y

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.119
okay blue let's stop cue nine and nine

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.900
ijen as blue baby you we're gonna try to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.040
go negative path I gotta be honest I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.510
booted up the game right here I don't

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.880
think I'm seeing the board that well

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.550
sometimes I boot up Isaac and it's like

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.469
it's just interfaced with my neural

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.390
network it's like oh well that's a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.180
pretty good start I don't even need to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.559
think about it I just I just play this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.329
time I'm looking at it and I gotta like

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.039
send the actual instructions to my brain

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.649
I gotta be like oh well move over here

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
do this do this not feeling it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.199
instinctual yet but maybe that's good

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
because I've been feeling it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.800
instinctually lately and not necessarily

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.670
playing that well we've got a couple of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.470
recent losses and a couple of erroneous

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.030
videos it sounds like the video itself

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.320
was an error as long as it's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.080
entertaining I don't believe that's the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.290
case however videos that were error

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.060
prone let's put it that way we're gonna

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.259
try to work past that and get something

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.990
done here if we could do the hush fight

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.810
that would be good you wouldn't

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.020
too bad pills right off the bed as an

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.579
insult it's alright though because I can

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.680
feel it you know we got two of clubs and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.299
two bombs that's kind of like it's an

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.820
equilibrium point we got four bombs

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.869
carrying capacity right now our K value

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.270
as far as I'm concerned that's eight

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.750
spirit hearts three tinted rocks and a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.340
golden chest I meant to say three small

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.570
rocks in the golden chest obviously that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.770
would have been ridiculous to begin with

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.600
but either way um putting it to five

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.310
cents we could also buy a spirit art but

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.509
we're probably good I'm thinking squeezy

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.979
in this boss room magic mush in the item

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.149
room and and we're good to go

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.009
and I'm also thinking I'll probably

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.920
never take a freaking pill as long as I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.050
live in this dang game rate of fire

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.030
decrease followed by a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.670
one that just takes the HP right out of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:25.290
my HP wallet not okay just continue to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.420
move along here I don't know I don't

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.100
mind a blue baby start we can get the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.590
the gears pump it and the juices

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.600
marinating I don't mind it but no no

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.970
I've been trying to like will these hush

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.460
fights into existence lately sometimes

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.280
just doesn't work you know that's like a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:49.560
sometimes food like the Cookie Monster

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.820
remember the uproar a couple years ago

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.050
the Cookie Monster yeah if you're not

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.760
familiar with the Cookie Monster I don't

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.370
know you probably are but for those of

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.470
you who are from an area in which Sesame

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.300
Street is probably not as prominent I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.710
mean it does that exist and it's

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.960
probably translated into like eighty

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.580
five languages but either way the Cookie

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.750
Monster he's a monster eats cookies so

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.420
you go c is for cookie that's good

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.920
enough for me maybe ten years ago they

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.190
were like oh we're a little concerned

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.450
about you know the obesity epidemic hey

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.910
we're gonna have the Cookie Monster not

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.500
eat so many cookies I mean this is like

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.830
a preview of what it was like to be on

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.100
the Internet in 2017 a year ago people

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.870
uproar PC culture has gone too far with

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.840
Cookie Monster's eating apples all of a

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.490
sudden I'm of two minds about it on the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.790
one hand is it bad to have Cookie

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.290
Monster oh that's the good stuff is it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.980
bad to have Cookie Monster eating some

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.300
healthy foods

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.460
I would suggest now then again our kids

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.080
watching the Cookie Monster and going

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.670
hey mom I want to eat cookies every day

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.830
for the rest of my life maybe maybe not

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.940
I'm gonna say probably not I don't think

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.050
you should be the Cookie Monster though

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.580
I think you should be like the calorie

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.370
monster and you should really care about

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.230
his macronutrient ratios so early in the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.760
morning make sure I have a protein and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.290
carb rich meal that's a little bit fat

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.060
the fish in later at night you switch to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.640
the protein plus fat meals cuz you don't

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.020
want to carve up before bed all of a

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.340
sudden you got kids looking like young

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:15.600
Tarzan making America's skinny again one

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.830
slap at a time like Vince said I have no

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.630
idea what I'm talking about

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.150
either way the floor went fine we didn't

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.800
get hit we got a bad trip pill I take no

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.720
responsibility for that as we head down

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.180
to the next floor Jacob's Ladder is a

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.070
lovely item

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.870
little Tesla curl for this room not to

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.320
have a tinted rock is actually a slap in

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.300
the face you went to the rock store and

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.010
you said you know what give me a handful

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.180
and if a tinted rock finds its way in

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.430
there that would be for the best and

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.800
they they sorted through them and said

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.560
no doesn't look like our secret room is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.199
gonna border the cursed room either so

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:57.370
we're kind of at the at the behest of

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:59.510
the game and right now these will work

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.330
they sort of work what if we just shoot

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.680
like now okay I just don't want to put

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.060
myself too much in harm's way three

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.210
bombs takes us out of that early

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.370
equilibrium so we actually like can

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:15.050
generate more than four bombs total with

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.120
the two of clubs now we kind of need HP

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.850
because if I it's like I got really

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.979
close to getting it there but it if I

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.840
get hit at all we're like in the danger

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.280
zone I definitely want parasite if you

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.389
like parasite Jacob's Ladder is a

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.370
wonderful combination but I don't want

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.930
to take it until we're sure of our bomb

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.520
situation like we can get to eight and

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.900
then use one of our eight bombs to get

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.180
it as fine it's far from bad but we're

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.979
kind of in tight so I want to just make

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.419
sure that we're maximizing all of our

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.400
available advantages cuz really you know

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.490
we put in this time in the early game we

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.240
could be set it's like compound interest

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.950
you know you ever do one of those

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.580
compound interest calculators by the way

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.190
it came up in math class when I was like

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.620
16 and you're like well if you start

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.840
putting the $100 a week in your bank

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.550
account with 3% compounded you know

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.430
biannually then blah blah blah and

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.120
you're like wow by the time I'm 50 I'm a

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.889
literal billionaire don't don't do those

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.389
calculations when you're 28 you're

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.010
already past that point where you're

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.449
like well if I start now I gotta at

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.849
least get an adequate level you know

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.910
it's not to say it's lost cause it's

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.349
still you know worth doing but those

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.820
numbers look a lot better when you're

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:30.410
younger then again think about it now

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.910
you know better to do it when you're 28

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.940
and when you're 60 probably let's go

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.590
back and get our items we do have two

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.270
keys so we could either check out the

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:43.220
shop and save a key or

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.660
can check out the the double key room

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.870
and I'll probably check out the double

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.760
key room a sob post I'm ray you know

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.050
we've been silly so far in this episode

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.080
and that's okay but I saw a post on

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.570
reddit a long time ago that actually and

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.980
I don't get inspired that often this

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.260
actually could be our secret room now

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.990
that I look at the floor layout I don't

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.480
get it inspired that often I don't I

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.210
have an acquaintance of mine he's been

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.680
in school for 80 years and if you're

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.240
watching this I don't think you are but

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.430
if you're watching this I mean no

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.090
disrespect but he posts this help the

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:19.580
self-help sup on Facebook all the time

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.920
all the time all day every day and I'm

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.300
like it's like you know your success is

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.750
what you make it and I'm like dude just

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:31.250
you've been in a school the scholastic

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.930
program since you know we met in 2006

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.970
it's like almost 12 years ago at this

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.760
point you gotta stop posting these

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.440
self-help memes and start you know turn

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.420
yourself into Jeff Bezos but I digress

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.340
and that stuff I kind of roll my eyes at

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:48.380
to some extent even though he's he's an

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:51.470
acquaintance of mine however let's fight

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.660
this boss saw post on Reddit Nimbus I I

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.930
forget to ask reddit thread but the gist

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.190
of it was like you know what was what's

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.470
the most inspiring thing you've ever

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.780
heard and the guy was like well I like I

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.130
washed out of my career at 30 or

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.320
something like that and I was thinking

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:09.200
about going back to school but I didn't

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.060
want to because by the time I finished

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.170
my undergrad I was gonna be like oh we

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.190
can't take it I can't take it we're

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.600
still in a great spot though we can

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.400
maybe get mega Satan as a result of

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.900
skipping that deal with the devil by the

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.150
time I finished my undergraduate degree

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.460
you'll be like 34 and then his friend

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.400
just like hit him with a most like

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.170
blue-collar obvious like matter-of-fact

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.750
advice he's like well you're gonna be 34

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.340
either way would you rather be 34 you

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.170
know having completed the degree or be

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:38.270
34 without the degree still wondering

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:39.560
what if so you know whenever I think you

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.090
know you see people all the time they're

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.530
like god it's too late to do this I wish

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.430
I'd done this with my life you're still

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:48.050
gonna be old one day God willing anyway

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:51.260
would you rather be old and have taken a

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.800
shot or the old saying a good thing

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.570
gotta

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.670
waste my time taking a shot you know I

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.589
always found that inspiring basically

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:03.680
the idea that you know you're screwed

00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:06.200
either way might as well go for it can

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.200
we maybe get into this secret room as

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.269
well this runs weird right now the

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.070
damage is good the rate of fire is bad

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:14.839
but it's actually not that bad because

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.070
we get a lot of value out of every

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:18.380
single one of our tiers thanks to

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.209
parasite plus Jacob's Ladder so we're

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.500
doing like our damage output is way

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.720
better than the stats would have you

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.370
believe and usually I'm I'm selling you

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.200
on the opposite I'm going oh just cuz we

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.390
have 20 damage and four rate of fire

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.160
doesn't mean this runs good let's go

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:34.370
peep this or the shot of thing

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.610
so we're in a an aberrant circumstance

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:40.940
here and I'm very happy for it however

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.950
we want to fight hush if possible we're

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.510
not there statistically yet rarely are

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.940
you there statistically necessarily but

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.709
we're not there yet it's worth noting we

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:52.720
want to fight mega Satan if possible we

00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:55.100
can get those done on the same run and

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.740
we might have the chance we got the bomb

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.350
certainly for now at least and we got

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:04.910
the we got the power to kill the angel

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:07.250
statues we just need the actual luck of

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:10.550
the the draw here to get the angel

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:13.130
statues to begin with and if we can get

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.450
say Sacred Heart for example as well I'm

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.790
not gonna kick it out of bed freedom

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.959
crackers

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:21.500
by the way show of hands you watching

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:27.709
this video you eat in bed explain to me

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:32.149
why I want to know cuz I there's been

00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:34.190
times in my life where I eat in bed when

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:36.079
I had a laptop computer I mean I still

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.779
have a laptop when my primary computer

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:41.779
was a laptop you know you put it on your

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:43.040
bed instead of your desk get a plate as

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:45.230
long as you're not even you know chili

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.180
or like a gazpacho or something like

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.150
that you're probably okay we can't I

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.830
mean I'm going to but we should

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.770
I really care about it we could blow it

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.970
up but I don't think it's worth it if

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.080
you're if you're an adult though when

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.300
you're eating in bed I'm not gonna tell

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.330
you what to do cos it adults they don't

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.190
like being told what to do and I I don't

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.450
like being told what to do either except

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:09.310
by my wife we have an equitable

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.310
relationship in that department however

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.850
shouldn't be eaten sandwiches in bed as

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.000
an adult that's just my personal opinion

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:21.830
I would rather you eat on a paper plate

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.310
at a table while sitting down then eat

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.600
on a ceramic plate in bed you're just

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.900
gonna get crumbs all over you but you're

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.220
gonna roll over them while I roll over

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.240
them as you you're asleep you can't

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.440
control if you're rolling over the

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:40.400
crumbs what do you think you're gonna

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:44.240
cleanliness superhero nobody I know some

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.620
clean people in my life let me tell you

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.590
this none of them are eating sandwiches

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.820
over a a plate on their bed they're

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.090
sitting down at the dining room table

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:55.220
having a conversation with their family

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:57.440
we're gonna get about on pace for boss

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.270
rush which we have done as blue baby but

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.690
you know they always like to teleport

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:04.100
out as well if possible kind of figured

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:08.780
we wouldn't get anything particularly

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:10.790
special on this floor in terms of like

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:16.580
deals but we'll move on nonetheless I

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:21.310
really do what the spirit heart I'm not

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:24.550
gonna take it not gonna take magic much

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:27.320
magic mush

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.580
one day still HP is good five and am

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.810
spirit arts we can take a deal with the

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.589
devil we'd rather take a deal with the

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:36.320
angel we'll see how it progresses I'll

00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:38.390
be honest with you like I uh when I

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.089
lived in South Korea I ate on my bed

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:49.399
that's because my apartment was about

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:52.430
eight square feet it was a bad idea

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:54.830
there's also that combined with I was

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.529
like if I be who cares if I make this

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.670
place jerky

00:12:56.529 --> 00:12:59.330
I'll do it unlimited bombs that's

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.920
perfect

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:04.130
I'm just saying I had nothing to lose

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.750
but you know sometimes you gotta you

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.370
gotta act we asked that dining room

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.160
table you know it could be the start of

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.360
something beautiful can you please like

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.260
die faster but also give me its years

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:22.160
upgrade and a range upgrade even like

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:27.470
this is surprisingly low range I'll open

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:32.720
it extremely worth it in like a mundane

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:34.520
degree to a mundane degree I want a fire

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.990
like it's tough because I want to fire

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.510
more often but I know that the more I

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.250
shoot the more we're gonna get these

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.720
fire mine shots to pop in them the more

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.190
dangerous my life is gonna become as a

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:48.290
result don't talk about that damage

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:51.709
that's embarrassing to me what makes you

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.959
small bad gas not worth the it's not

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:56.620
even worth one of our unlimited bombs in

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:56.620
my opinion

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:07.350
stop no I knew we should not have taken

00:14:05.939 --> 00:14:12.959
the range upgrades nice by the way we

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:15.089
should not have taken fire mine it's a

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.860
difficult situation for me because the

00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:19.410
damage is amazing and also you notice

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:23.910
like Jacob's Ladder is actually

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:26.309
spreading the fire mind around so like

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.809
the enemies we're facing are getting

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:29.519
screwed by fire mind as well

00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:32.430
fire mine is the only thing that wins

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:35.129
here you know it's proving that it's

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.689
influences is dominating here I was

00:14:35.129 --> 00:14:39.209
gonna say domineering and changed at the

00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:40.649
last second and it became dominating it

00:14:39.209 --> 00:14:42.720
pronounced it weird

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:46.379
put the emphasis on the wrong syllable

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.990
as Mike Myers says in the classic

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:52.920
Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle view from the

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:55.170
top a movie that has largely been

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:59.970
forgotten because it looks like not very

00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:04.079
good alright this run is like one big if

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:06.149
statement it's all conditional it's good

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:12.420
except when it's not you know we got to

00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:16.410
tears upgrade except when we don't but I

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:19.290
think it's working more or less would

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.339
love to buy a spirit heart instead you

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.019
know we're not using the poop for

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:24.540
anything so we'll take mystery gift and

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:30.059
we'll try to pop this on a little deal

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:32.009
with the Angels situation I'm also torn

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:33.720
like a Natalie Imbruglia song because

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:36.959
hash in a shot that time that could have

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.610
exploded I probably should be blowing up

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:41.160
all these mushrooms but I want to make

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:43.259
the best play possible for us to get

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.029
this is where we started though the best

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:47.129
play possible for us us to get to the

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:49.139
hush fight which requires us to maybe go

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:53.790
a little bit faster like twisters verse

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:55.709
on slow jams but I don't know if we're

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.870
throwing the baby out with the bathwater

00:15:55.709 --> 00:16:00.360
in that situation you know what I mean

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:04.800
like are we are we gonna start going too

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:06.300
fast that we just die we would have been

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.930
better off having you know some more

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.430
modest aims

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.199
or are we right to put the pedal to the

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.870
metal here and try for the true

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:22.259
greatness instead of just a small

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:23.579
acceptance of meager rewards I believe

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:26.569
that that is still the second secret

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:29.040
room all dude infamy is legit

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:30.240
that was stupid but I did get the second

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.290
secret room out of it all right

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.879
all right all right all right over okay

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:39.930
the stain is no big deal this is the

00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:41.579
worst attack though but even when we

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.379
miss with our shots we can still light

00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:50.250
him on fire we can still hit him with a

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:53.250
little electricity well if he pops up

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.930
close he's gonna be some serious trouble

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.490
we're like one full floor behind

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.800
schedule for boss rush but if we get

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:06.620
lucky we can make up that time later no

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:08.329
deal that hurts me

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.400
wait a seventy two point five percent

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:12.890
chance and you you slap me in the face

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.589
but you know what means we get to hold

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:21.439
on to mystery gifts for a triumphant

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:23.140
return later might not be doing too much

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:25.790
for us right now

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.709
but I believe in the power of the the

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.750
late-game mystery gift

00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:34.520
oh and skinny odd mothers like that odd

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:37.400
mushroom is decent we can absorb the

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:41.150
speed downgrade we like the mild damage

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.610
upgrade plus the extra HP we got keys

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:49.580
I'm willing to leverage those keys you

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:51.350
got to spend keys to make keys not

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.920
touching those though this is like if we

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:57.110
could fight that enemy all day every day

00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:01.120
and what a what a turn of events we can

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:05.960
now see the map hello Kate

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.040
enjoy have fun kind of a weird thing to

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.350
say to somebody about to go to a

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.170
doctor's appointment but you know it's

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:17.960
all hell so the guiding a guiding value

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:19.550
in my life okay so I would I would give

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.110
up on the boss rush dream I don't think

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.210
it's it's in the cards for us at the

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:26.179
present moment ooh but speaking of in

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:29.360
the cards I got to get used to not

00:18:26.179 --> 00:18:32.120
having unlimited bombs we've got a lot

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:35.900
and that's a that's a boss rush enabler

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.820
right there I still believe in the power

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.300
of mystery gift on a deal with the angel

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:45.440
and or devil in fact we really want to

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:52.730
get clever and by clever I mean probably

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:54.920
a little stupid we could if we get a

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:57.020
deal with the devil we could still try

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.970
to push for a deal with the angel by

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.860
using mystery gift to get a devil item

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:04.100
for free but that leaves us like four

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.080
chances to get to angel rooms which I

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.809
would you know you could run like some

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.070
kind of linear regression on that hot

00:19:08.809 --> 00:19:14.179
and fresh out the kitchen

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:17.010
mama rollin that yn X y equals MX plus B

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:20.080
got every man in here

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:22.960
is solving for the you know y-intercept

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.430
so we did get a deal with the devil

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.470
magic mush is beautiful we didn't have a

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.680
damage multiplier so it's a big help ma

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:35.400
the void is excellent

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:38.230
ayah Belial the way I see it right now

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.440
we read like Robert Frost two roads

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:44.440
diverged in a wood if we don't take mob

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.350
the void then we're committing to trying

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.150
to get the angel statue fighting mega

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.100
Satan if we do get mob the void we're

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:55.090
committing to the hush path and the- i

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:57.880
think the smart money is on going for

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.680
mob the void here also know i was

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.090
thinking of a theme that's wrong this

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.250
mob the void doesn't allow us to give

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:11.850
demon hearts does it Wow

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:14.500
so I of bleiel is exquisite with

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:19.420
parasite plus jacob's ladder' plus fire

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:23.740
mines so really what we have to do is

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:25.960
just stay away from any enemies we could

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.310
totally I did not expect this by the way

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.460
I didn't realize this energy was so

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:32.080
strong we also have eleven damage but we

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.060
stay away from the enemies we could

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.650
totally make boss rush here and we could

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.390
teleport out but we could also fight

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.580
boss rush just just to get the items

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.980
because it seems like this is gonna be

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:47.430
like very much on the easy side I will

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:49.720
say we did not need mob the void at all

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:52.420
what does jumper cables do again I

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.640
totally forgot jumper cables it's like

00:20:52.420 --> 00:21:00.510
when you fight a boss you jump jumper

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:03.250
cables Isaac I knew this at one point

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:06.940
one bar of charge for every 15 enemies

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:10.240
killed we don't have a we don't have an

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:13.960
item right now so like a spacebar items

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.500
so I think we just kind of don't take

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.360
that

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.100
[Music]

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.860
it's pretty terrible well we kind of

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:27.090
screwed ourselves there let's fight the

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:29.400
boss moon card out of boss rush can

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:32.100
always get dad's key although it's

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.940
unlikely do you want to take the

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:40.050
negative oh how could you not take holy

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:41.940
light in this situation and steam sales

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.010
actually great as well so it's like dude

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.680
a hundred percent chance we will at

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.540
least make it to the hush fighting or at

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.309
least let's be a little bit more

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.660
conservative time is not gonna be the

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:55.650
limiting factor if we don't make it to

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:58.530
the hush fight HP is gonna be the

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:01.140
limiting factor but like we have made up

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:04.080
an outrageous amount of time very

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.640
quickly and this I I'm calling it it's

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.250
not the strongest run we've ever had but

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.320
it's one of the best synergies for tear

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:13.770
effects you've ever had every holy light

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.080
shot pierces and also infects every

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:20.160
other enemy with holy light that it hits

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:23.070
at least now we can't do that not with

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:30.050
the negative copy dream is pretty low

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:30.050
percentage but like considerate

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:38.760
dude when an enemy gets hit they get hit

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.800
like 15 times fast bombs is pretty bad

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.780
you know what

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.260
what would NL do and L would come in

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.620
here

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:50.760
that's wouldn't really suggest that as a

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:53.310
positive they're 22 cents Steam sale and

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.690
some extra bombs to me that indicates we

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.280
can go back to our shop and try to play

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.960
around with it a little bit without any

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.520
mapping I guess there's like a mild

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:07.230
chance you wouldn't be able to make it

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:09.270
to our to our hush fight but we're

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:14.210
looking pretty good this could be a

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:16.170
second school is indeed so we good

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.210
fighting the angel statue doesn't give

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.650
us anything but it's one of you ever

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.070
have that situation you're like I know

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.210
this isn't gonna work but I gotta try it

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.860
could have gotten something out of it I

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:29.370
think I might need the spear at heart so

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:32.970
well check and with Steam sale we don't

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:38.250
really want anything there we got a

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:39.990
check for like something jar of flies is

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.810
actually excellent we don't need any

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:45.420
more spirit arts just jar of flies is

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:51.540
worth the the money spent here already

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:53.640
diplopia meet the Pope E is great but it

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:57.570
we're kind of past the use by a date you

00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:00.240
know yeah I think we just go so we have

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:03.150
we've leveraged ourselves to to the brim

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:08.160
we're at a great position right now just

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:09.810
stay strong stay away from like every

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.790
enemy on the screen and look at all

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:17.390
these flies dude you don't even need to

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:21.920
shoot the enemies to generate the flies

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.920
every time you miss you're making flies

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.290
yeah yeah this will do this will do

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.290
nicely

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:39.650
keep going why not ah it hurts me when

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.840
you you give me that chest with infinite

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:46.400
possibilities and then on roll number

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:50.780
one you say sorry shops closed not very

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:53.210
nice also not very nice it's so dim in

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.620
here I can't see anything I can't see

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:59.120
where the doors are I can't see my hand

00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:02.210
in front of my own face so we are

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:06.230
actually gonna have like an unstoppable

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:08.510
fly are me the flies rarely even get to

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:13.550
kill an enemy our shots just wipe the

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:15.320
enemies from across the map and we just

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.380
keep generating more and the idea is you

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.630
know hopefully they'll just Corrine into

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.280
like the mom's heart fight and destroy

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.640
mom's heart without me being at any risk

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.640
whatsoever

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:36.320
it's good because we want all this is

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.879
amazing we want the Flies to not kill

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.980
anything because the less things the

00:25:37.879 --> 00:25:45.519
flies killed the more flies we generate

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:47.840
off of each kill we did get a deal

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:49.460
remember this is what we committed to we

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.350
can we can afford to get flying flying

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.240
is fine here and that floor took us

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.490
about you know 80 seconds to wipe every

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.679
enemy off the map plus get more HP plus

00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.649
the deal with the devil plus you know

00:25:57.679 --> 00:26:03.169
generate infinity flies so I'm feeling

00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:04.519
real strong about this you might have

00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:06.289
been skeptical earlier you were like

00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:09.350
what's he talking about best tier effect

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:12.529
ever I'll admit you know we've had some

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:15.769
really great like Polyphemus runs had

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:17.389
some really great proptosis runs but you

00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:17.840
got to consider this one to be up there

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:21.080
right now

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.639
I asked if you talked about classics

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:30.559
does this name get brought up whatever

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:32.450
this insert episode name here Thank You

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:38.000
flies sometimes you know I get by with a

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:40.789
little help from my flies whoa where

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.279
when I shoot if you sunk below ground

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:50.149
I'm not certain but I thank you for my

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:52.879
flies can I find hush and get gold on

00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:56.450
this run I'm not certain but you know

00:26:52.879 --> 00:26:59.690
I'll try oh I get by with a little help

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:02.919
from my flies I'm gonna try with a

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.919
little help from my flash

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:10.690
all my flies are gone like an LCD

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.370
soundsystem song alright so just

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:15.970
remember that when you're done with this

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:19.990
you want to go down to Sheol you don't

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:23.169
want to go up up is the bad path this

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:24.730
donation city as far as I'm concerned we

00:27:23.169 --> 00:27:25.960
got just enough keys and we're not going

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:29.649
to the chest so I think we don't need

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:36.399
any more mind buying another spirit

00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:37.899
heart it should be ok we haven't donated

00:27:36.399 --> 00:27:41.830
in a little while so this feels like the

00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:43.809
right thing to do you know we the run

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:48.639
gave to us and we're gonna give back to

00:27:43.809 --> 00:27:51.399
it right now let me shoot a little it'd

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:53.769
be swell but let's work on smart fly

00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:54.970
which is okay and then the D one doubles

00:27:53.769 --> 00:27:59.100
consumables when we need this rate of

00:27:54.970 --> 00:28:01.059
fire increase dude that is excellent

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:07.470
golden chest with the golden chest

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:07.470
inside of it three cents left

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.690
495 feel good about that

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.150
now that our rate of fire is increased

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:19.130
keep in mind also got a net before uh we

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:21.980
can actually assuming our range holds

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:26.210
out which it totally does we can just

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:29.810
stand back here rate of fire is getting

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:34.430
absurd we can hit the space bar without

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:38.270
canceling our rate of fire yeah it's

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:42.070
pretty good I didn't notice the charge

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:48.830
bar actually says ma overtop of it

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:54.310
ma ma ma of the void you're a minor

00:28:48.830 --> 00:29:00.440
damage up circle shots are up to snuff

00:28:54.310 --> 00:29:03.140
ma ma the void deal with the devil okay

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:06.380
that's we almost struck greatness

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:08.770
temporarily to even sniff that that is

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.770
an honor

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.780
not the fastest hush fight we've ever

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.820
had we know we're gonna unlock an item

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.770
though and that's good I totally forgot

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:22.480
us do the keeper on this run as we just

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:28.990
unlocked it it's my bed hopefully you're

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:31.679
enjoying the run regardless the rest of

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:34.540
this is gonna be over in like two sweet

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:37.179
which is French for blink and you'll

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.010
miss it Thank You infamy for the save it

00:29:37.179 --> 00:29:45.550
also deflected us into an area that was

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:47.620
completely safe otherwise sometimes we

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.880
get like the ultimate static shots nice

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.460
try nice try nice try

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.559
I think it's like if a shot explodes on

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.750
impact it causes like all the parasites

00:29:53.559 --> 00:30:01.030
static tears to explode instantaneously

00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:03.570
oh dude infamy is done amazing work for

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.570
us so far

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:11.470
come on don't make me change direction

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:18.930
we got triple the rate of fire we're

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:18.930
used to you dog you dirty dog

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.150
all right either way we're in the clear

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:27.830
this is a fun hush fight I'm glad we

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.180
prioritized this over the mega satan

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:33.140
dream that may have never come to

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:35.030
fruition should have generated way more

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.950
flies just remember old fates reward not

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:39.350
very good just remember you're going

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:43.010
down a shoal here this could be a avoid

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:46.640
play if we wanted it to be I'm gonna

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:48.050
stick with the you know what one

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:54.890
annoying

00:30:48.050 --> 00:31:00.080
fight per video please plus a to say but

00:30:54.890 --> 00:31:01.910
we could actually use some HP I actually

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.350
think that for bombs for a demon heart

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:07.550
is like an okay trade right now it's

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:14.420
kind of you know beggars can't be

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:16.910
choosers help should not shoot near

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:20.540
enemies but when enemies teleport around

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:23.180
you it's hard to force that into

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:27.350
existence you know feels like a second

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:33.920
secret room right there oh I knew it

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:35.900
sign happened okay well you know what we

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.200
had to check see if our instinct was

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.200
correct

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.610
it's mauve the void that gives you the

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:47.870
chance to get demon hearts I'm just

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:51.049
scared because I can't really afford to

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:56.590
use it because if the enemies explode

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:58.880
thanks to fire mind we're gonna have to

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:03.440
you know we're in we're in tight this is

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:06.860
what I mean with negative one luck I'm

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.340
not fully convinced it's it's the right

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.080
play

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:12.020
basically Big Ups I mean that worked out

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:15.650
well okay basically big ups to infamy

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:21.530
for saving me from possibly like having

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:23.630
a chance to be dead right now yeah I

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:25.159
think to be honest with you I talk about

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:27.260
overthinking it a lot I think we're

00:32:25.159 --> 00:32:36.830
under thinking this one it's probably

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:41.020
like a much more common problem wow that

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.020
was you actually stood no chance

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.000
think we just wait for the feet you

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.429
shoot the feet we're gonna get like

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.850
outrageous damage potential that's all

00:32:52.429 --> 00:33:00.980
that could hurt oh excuse me sir now

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.360
keep it going now three guppy items out

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.150
of these red chests it's happened one

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.270
time before in my adult life I believe

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:11.540
it's gonna happen again

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:13.160
there's one there's two there's three

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.200
there's four just scene of you're paying

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:18.440
attention okay we got three bad trip

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.990
pills to arrange upgrades and then I'm

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.400
excited uh certainly I would say if you

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.860
look at the Hall of Shame this is a

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.309
candidate for worst pill selection of

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.309
all time

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:38.160
I hate to say you dude there's it's it's

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:43.530
not likely there's a chance we lose this

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:46.470
one HP is a little low fire mines coming

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:47.880
in hot off the presses Lux not great so

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.890
we're not expecting any items down here

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.410
I'm not saying we should lose just

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:59.840
saying it's it's plausible there's a

00:33:52.410 --> 00:34:08.640
loss residing in here okay evil eye it's

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:10.620
actually pretty solid it never works

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:12.510
like as often as I wanted to but the

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:17.040
shots that come out of it are gonna be

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:18.930
12 out of 10 might be saying nly you

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.050
always say 12 out of 10 you never say 13

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:23.340
out of 10

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.170
what are you greedy you want a hundred

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:28.080
and thirty percent one hundred and

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:32.370
twenty percent is already like orders of

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:40.800
magnitude above the call of duty world

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:43.020
at war don't get greedy

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.169
don't always seem to go you don't know

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:48.510
what you got till it's gone song doesn't

00:34:46.169 --> 00:34:50.429
go don't it always seem to go you know

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.260
never be content with what you have it's

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:56.580
the the moral of the story is exactly

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:58.080
the opposite of that they didn't paved

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:00.869
paradise and put up an even bigger

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.760
paradise unless you drive like an ant v

00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:04.230
in which case I imagine a parking lot

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.940
probably is paradise I've been in

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:13.380
situations where paradise as a parking

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:15.540
lot driving around you're late for

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:18.570
something oh I got to find a parking lot

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.830
real quick probably saying and I'll stop

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.180
being a baby just throw your four ways

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.180
on and stop in the middle of the road

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:32.369
it's not a conducive strat so we got to

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.350
HP I actually would still give us like

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:38.240
better okay now I would not give us

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:38.240
better than 50/50 chances of survival

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:48.000
so I'm gonna take my usually calm

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.590
demeanor and become a little bit more

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.020
focused at the present moment we got a

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:54.970
spirit heart back all is forgiven

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.619
this guy's gonna give us a ten out of

00:35:54.970 --> 00:36:01.869
ten tarot card like the hero font and

00:35:56.619 --> 00:36:04.270
we're off to the races not even gonna

00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:05.500
pick that out this it's an embarrassment

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:09.580
that you would give me that instead of

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:10.869
the item I asked for it you got to shoot

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:16.180
at enemies sometimes if you want to deal

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:24.790
damage buddy just I'm so worried about

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:29.710
the the fire mind pay outs please dude

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:32.260
fire mind is like so good but could it

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:40.290
have like a slightly reduced area of

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:42.160
effect please okay okay we found it

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:45.180
thank God we're fighting an enemy that

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:48.990
never gets close to us right he said

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:53.070
jokingly come on come on come on come on

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:53.070
comes and goes it comes and goes

00:36:53.160 --> 00:37:03.010
Whedon could be easy if the winning was

00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:05.589
like my dreams oh well that's all right

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:11.010
they're gonna make us work for it two

00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:11.010
items big plays

- I'm excited pills know why I didn't

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.630
dawn on me they're exactly the same but

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:22.220
alright alright Capricorn was the big

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.920
saving grace there but 2020 I mean

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.839
damage-wise is gonna be disgusting just

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:32.210
keep in mind we can't stand near the

00:37:26.839 --> 00:37:41.000
enemy it's like a police song please
