00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
hey everybody welcome back dinner on the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.940
line plays The Binding of Isaac out for

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.940
the plus we survived the last run

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.639
despite like dude it was oh my don't

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.309
even get me freakin stuff phew didn't

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.049
see that oh my god we never got a single

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.830
damage of grand til the womb one and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.750
then it was that 99% of our damage was

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.539
provided by a single Empress card anyway

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.199
I think I'm gonna try to make the keeper

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.180
work again

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.210
I like the keeper cuz it might seem like

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.790
it's yours your seed by the way QB m7y

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
Neff I've always said that you might be

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
saying well the keepers you know he's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.050
dangerous bloke and I say of course I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.969
say bloke all the time it's just a part

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.920
of my everyday lexicon ever since I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.530
watched Trainspotting 2 on the movie

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.160
channel and geezer Guy Ritchie gave me

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.320
personal permission to do so but because

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.969
we have so little done as the keeper or

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
as I like to call them the geezer it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.780
actually does not matter because it's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.510
kind of like a low stakes game right

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.780
like we we could beat almost anything

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.610
and it would be a step forward for us

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.900
and unlocking new stuff plus I just like

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.880
playing as the keeper cuz you know the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.380
stakes are high I love it when the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.970
stakes are high I love you when you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.080
deuces are wild that's another thing you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.110
got to know about me if you're gonna

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.470
keep watching this show unfortunately

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.240
our item is kind of trash at least it's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.470
kind of trash for the keeper

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.119
specifically I don't want to there's a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.820
lot of items situationally that are

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.280
great or situationally are garbage and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.070
often times are great universally or on

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
a general sense apart from that

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.369
unfortunately the Wooden Nickel already

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.729
fits that bill for us please stop taking

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.950
damage what I mean by that is that the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.829
Wooden Nickel is mostly like pretty bad

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.560
and almost exclusively not really worth

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.969
your time but if you're the keeper it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.860
actually like the only thing that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.600
separates you from the animals you know

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.369
it's it's only thing keeping you in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.500
business now you're gonna think that

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.289
what I'm about to say is nonsense but

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.450
I'm the world's luckiest yet also

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.970
shrewdest man of the Dwight variety

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.319
I said to myself self we got one bomb

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.280
you know what we should do

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.620
I almost said said to myself why don't

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.180
we walk on the spikes to pick that up

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.099
because of swallowed penny that would

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.019
not have been smart but I said to myself

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.390
self

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.190
we got one bomb why don't we try to blow

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.349
up as many pots as possible with it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.760
maybe we'll get swallowed penny never in

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.269
a million years would I have expected it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.760
to work on the first bomb so lucky us

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.379
swallowed penny is one of the best

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.900
things you can get items or otherwise

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.769
are we on an excellent it's not an excel

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.060
floor just a long floor one of the best

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.829
things you can get is the keeper

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.599
essentially this makes it very very

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.890
difficult to die now have I found a way

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.090
to do so in the past absolutely dude if

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.250
you think I'm exploring the rest of this

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.790
floor you're as stupid as I am honestly

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.000
that's so rare like cell phone that was

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.980
also like almost a little bit too mean

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.130
that's a joke I don't know if this joke

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.019
has origins elsewhere but real talk I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.410
was when I was growing up for like a few

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.260
years I lived with my parents obviously

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.609
because I was like 7 to 11 years old but

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.500
we also lived with my maternal

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.180
grandparents cuz you know three

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.530
generations under one roof and kind of

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.859
like a pseudo Brady Bunch sort of

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.030
situation we were having dinner with

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.000
them because they lived in the upstairs

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.019
portion of the house and my grandma was

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.910
like you know I think we need to buy new

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.170
curtains I'm worried that you know

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.150
somebody could be looking through the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.180
window when I'm changing and then my

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.060
grandfather said I mean this is I'm

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.920
quoting so I apologized might come

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.220
across a little misogynistic it was born

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.849
in like 1935 or something with roses in

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.260
his eyes of course he said woman who

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.870
would want to see you naked they must be

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.340
as crazy as I am and I laughed and I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:10.840
laughed and it's this defining anecdote

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:14.290
for my humor to this day and age yeah

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.329
the prevailing idea being you can make

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.700
fun of somebody else as long as it also

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.020
comes with a greater cellphone it likely

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.060
not self phone you know like a Toshiba

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.520
or something how old am I like a Toshiba

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.350
you know those Toshiba cell follows

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.040
Motorola razors people are walking

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.870
around with in today's day and age you

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.970
can all what you can usually I shouldn't

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.639
say always you can usually get away with

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.270
poking fun at other people as long as

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.010
within the poking fun you also give a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.169
little self roast in there of a higher

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.010
magnitude that's my philosophy at least

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.800
is it true

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.660
not always not always is no axiom is

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.150
true 100% of the time including that one

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.930
it's like a nose only a Sith deals in

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.660
absolutes sort of situation but yes you

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.400
may feel sympathy for my grandmother

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.200
that's kind of a rude thing to say but

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:18.330
it's it stood the test of time in the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:19.770
memory banks anyway we've got 19 cents

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.570
here we're gonna have at least eighteen

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.889
cents after this room we want to

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.810
preserve our deal with the devil chance

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.810
cuz it could be of some value for us

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.919
excuse me sir you should be deceased the

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.280
ideal situation is a great deal with the

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:41.729
devil for one hard we are able to pick

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.620
it up and then there's an HP upgrade on

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.210
the boss so we take the HP upgrade it's

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.580
like we didn't do anything at all if we

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.710
have to do angel path completely fine by

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.140
me I got nothing against that I'm gonna

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.060
donate two cents here just Ted I thought

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.590
maybe we had a chance I didn't realize

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.169
there was an upgrade at level four but

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.639
I'll take it

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.490
thought about taking the card there as

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.729
well but I think we're better off saving

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.500
our money cuz you never know maybe you

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.850
know we're able to get to an item room

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.389
on the next floor as a result or

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.430
something like that and got a lot of

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.620
game left out ahead of us pretty much

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.039
every keeper run I've put on the channel

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.639
so far has had like a chance to win and

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.110
it has been squandered so I'm a little

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.580
gun-shy I guess you could say about our

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.650
chances here we also just kind of blew

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.130
our deal with the devil chance there to

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.450
a minor degree at least I haven't seen

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.370
the item room yet to the best of my

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.690
memory the other alternative as we saw

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.270
it and it was garbage because I didn't

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.340
pick anything up but let's go test here

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.330
can I get some luck upgrades by the way-

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.490
to luck

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:51.160
feeling the burn a little bit don't mind

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:52.780
the Flies but it's gonna put us in a

00:06:51.160 --> 00:07:01.030
crunch for other consumables now this

00:06:52.780 --> 00:07:02.440
guy I really thought we had outsmarted

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.630
the system there we just needed to do a

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.930
little bit of an Elvis Stojko instead we

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:11.340
did a Brian Boitano an inferior move and

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:15.010
we found ourselves taking more damage

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:20.020
still have that 1% chance though stars

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:22.360
moon my moon my man we got plays here we

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.680
got plays we forget boss rush we already

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:30.280
did boss no we're never gonna do boss

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:32.650
rush that's a stupid question don't boss

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.790
rush is dangerous I should say so it's

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.920
not that we're never gonna do it I'm

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.370
just a little frightened at the present

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.020
moment

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.060
no thank you we need to go to the item

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.100
room

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.220
but the moon card is also very very

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.570
useful it can take us out of the curse

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:55.030
room if we want to go to the curse room

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:57.280
or it could take us out of the boss Trap

00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:06.460
room which we have not had the access to

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:08.020
as a result of our HP booger tears it's

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.250
very good I don't know why I stopped and

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.630
thought about it and I was like what

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:14.040
about this is bad where's the catch

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:18.040
there is no catch it's just a good item

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.630
so let's go back spawn room please go

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.070
low

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.870
many people have yelled at me as

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.520
politely as they conceivably could on

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.900
social media and said you idiot stop

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.940
trying to stand near the door just go

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:32.289
down as soon as you get in the room dude

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.500
but like wait a minute hold up it's your

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:39.420
boy

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:51.720
young genius feeling blessed picking up

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:53.790
fat stacks fight an angel statues why is

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.570
the self-sacrifice room all of a sudden

00:08:53.790 --> 00:09:01.670
the greatest idea under the Tuscan Sun

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.670
starring Diane Lane and Richard Gere

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:10.640
no that's unfaithful under the Tuscan

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:14.330
Sun is a Jennifer Connelly joint I think

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:17.870
obviously we'll take this key piece

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.870
young genius

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:27.029
leave as much money around as you can

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:30.860
stomach dude cuz that's HP if you get

00:09:27.029 --> 00:09:33.930
hit so we do not want to teleport

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:42.600
teleporting here is idiocy of the

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:46.649
highest degree but if we can knock out a

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.199
greed mega satan run i would consider

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:51.389
myself the world's dumbest genius we

00:09:49.199 --> 00:09:55.680
also have 69 cents it's like written in

00:09:51.389 --> 00:10:02.809
stone a guaranteed success story bomb

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:02.809
for a key yeah so we got our curse room

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:09.990
check this out I don't care how that was

00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:14.220
done I don't care about the rune I just

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.990
want to live yes how'd I do I don't want

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.290
to pick up the money though you know

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.339
like I recognize I can keep doing that

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:26.970
but I don't want to I don't want to pick

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:30.350
up the money though is what is that

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:35.870
it's another blank rune it's a yera

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.870
it if you're at the blank room perthro

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:45.930
algae's it seized on it he has not done

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:52.410
it I just want to go to the boss Trap

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:53.610
room man take me the bus chat room dudu

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.230
dudu I mean I guess we could blow

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.029
ourselves up in the head in there but at

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:02.009
that point we're asking for a loss so

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:03.750
let's just not be stupid instead there's

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:05.220
a lot of probably like face palming and

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.069
out what are you doing you'll cut me

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.970
some slack okay we have 70 cents and we

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:14.040
just went to the self sacrifice room as

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.230
the keeper and got an outrageous value

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.579
out of it so if you'll excuse me I'm not

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.929
feeling too perturbed about my eyes at

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:20.929
play right now

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:33.240
bulgar tears by the way basically good

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:39.069
can't take it too risky basically good

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:42.459
without magnanimous damage could always

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:43.119
use a little bit more but gonna by

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:44.769
pay-to-play

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:46.839
even donate some money it just seems

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:52.089
like the right kind of run usually

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:53.679
something all unlock at six six six kind

00:11:52.089 --> 00:11:55.389
of hope when we get like a luck upgrade

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:58.209
to pull ourselves out of the doldrums of

00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:59.649
luck here obviously got thirty eight

00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:05.050
cents to play with a little fun money

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:06.279
for the rest of the run if we play our

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:10.410
cards right we might be able to get a

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:13.050
decent like ace of spades payout here

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:16.809
somewhere like we're generating money

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:18.309
not that much of it maybe a lot of it

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:21.459
but not all of it is happening in like

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:24.519
one room so that's costing us but like

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:31.389
apart from that pretty good so we have a

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:34.170
one no we did it this room sucks dude

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:36.910
this is like a universally reviled room

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.110
why do we have a 0% angel chance I guess

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.879
it doesn't carry over from the previous

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:45.209
floor so you know screw the deal with

00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:45.209
the devil chance I guess this is not bad

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:49.990
what it is in particular we got 46

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.730
percent at least for now that's pretty

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.379
good what this is is a great chance for

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.410
booger tears to prove that it's like

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:59.889
useful especially apparently if we can

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:02.800
stack up the boogers where the enemies

00:12:59.889 --> 00:13:04.540
spawn it can kill the enemies before

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.160
they get a chance to do anything so we

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.660
would love a tears upgrade or an HP

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.790
upgrade plus a good one hard deal with

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.699
the devil a damage upgrade is also very

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.110
nice but rate of fire is kind of the

00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:20.549
bread and butter by which we're making a

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.549
buttered salami sandwich here

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:30.009
was your favorite part you you were a

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:31.660
child of the everyman or were you like a

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:33.279
you know private school kid who ate

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.949
lunch at the cafeteria every day Cade

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:37.870
grew up in a in an affluent neighborhood

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:39.459
not much of a surprise you've you're not

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.319
familiar with Vancouver it's very much

00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:42.970
like you know parts of it are like the

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:44.350
Beverly Hills of Canada there's other

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.000
parts of Canada that are like that as

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.579
well I shouldn't have taken that pill it

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.920
could have been a health down but you

00:13:48.579 --> 00:13:52.149
know kate tells me they the school that

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.860
she went to was like one of the best

00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:55.300
it's a public school it was one of the

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.970
best in the country apparently you know

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.730
they had like an on-campus subway which

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.079
is just we drove like 45 minutes to get

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.629
the subway where I'm at the high school

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:06.970
but you know we all I'm saying is our

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:09.189
high school I remember specifically 80

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.389
cent cheeseburgers 65 cent hamburgers

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:13.540
makes it sound like I grew up in the

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:16.149
1950s I went to high school between 2002

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.069
and 2006 the hamburgers were just so bad

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:20.139
the free market would not let them

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:23.310
charge more than a dollar for a meal cuz

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:25.360
it was that awful

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.740
nobody was eating at the cafeteria

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.930
unless they didn't have a choice you

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:32.319
know the number one selling item in our

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:34.779
cafeteria was french fries literally you

00:14:32.319 --> 00:14:37.120
know your your brain as a teenager is

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:40.329
just it'll take any nutrients it's so

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.740
hungry for energy and vitamins you feed

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:44.920
your growing body what should you have

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:48.339
for lunch how about you know a pre trans

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.620
fat band box of french fries you can get

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:52.930
away with it as a teenager but what the

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.339
heck was my school doing dude as as a

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.470
teenager I was just like whatever they

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:58.959
got bigger problems as an adult I'm like

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.569
what these kids are your responsibility

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:02.980
you're letting the cafeteria serve like

00:15:00.569 --> 00:15:04.959
you walk into the cafeteria half the

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:08.920
kids just have a box of french fries for

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:11.379
lunch we got called Jamie Oliver dude

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.240
this is not okay I'm not the health

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:16.149
zealot or anything like that I'm just

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.319
like I school at a soda machine in it as

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:19.170
well like a vending machine

00:15:17.319 --> 00:15:21.939
I got an almost no problem with that

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.649
like if you gave me a piece of paper and

00:15:21.939 --> 00:15:25.269
said it's a referendum should high

00:15:23.649 --> 00:15:30.670
schools be allowed to have soda machines

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:32.800
in them you might vote no but it would

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.089
be close the only reason that vote no is

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.040
because like

00:15:34.089 --> 00:15:38.050
you know there's like water fountains

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.069
there already why not have like I mean I

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.360
guess if they could buy soda from the

00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:41.680
cafeteria who cares see is what I'm

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.540
getting at I'm not I don't have a firm

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.149
opinion on it one way or the other I can

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.370
see both sides are both sides equally

00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:50.110
valid in my eyes right now yes but that

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.910
could change I know there's always

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.529
anytime you oppose something like that

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.149
there's always like you know well people

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:56.709
you know you can't hold their hand their

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:58.149
whole life good should I be able to get

00:15:56.709 --> 00:15:59.709
in my car without consulting the

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:00.699
government look I understand where

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.809
you're coming from as well there's

00:16:00.699 --> 00:16:05.290
something to say about personal freedom

00:16:01.809 --> 00:16:06.399
yet at the same time no offense meant if

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:10.149
you're on the younger side if you're

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:11.319
watching this and you're 15 16 14 you're

00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:12.910
not an adult you don't have an adult

00:16:11.319 --> 00:16:15.490
brain you might be very smart you might

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:18.879
even be smarter than I am but you don't

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.410
have an adult brain you know you the

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:23.439
decisions you make that you think are

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:26.769
completely devoid of outside influence

00:16:23.439 --> 00:16:29.050
aren't necessarily so I think that you

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:30.430
know some corporations can use that to

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.839
prey on you a little bit because you

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.879
have a little bit more innocence in your

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:35.709
decision-making process and you know

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:38.170
they say why not have a cigarette

00:16:35.709 --> 00:16:39.309
it's sales stand inside of the high

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.220
school and then just you know if you

00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:43.269
don't smoke just don't use it you know

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.889
you got to think of it from a public

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:48.399
damage stamp well anyway the whole point

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:49.990
is it's not about that but I don't think

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:52.660
kids should just be eating french fries

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.429
for lunch like once a week no wonder we

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:58.029
were like falling asleep in class that

00:16:54.429 --> 00:17:01.689
and you know it was boring but anyway

00:16:58.029 --> 00:17:03.040
you get the idea what I was gonna say

00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:06.929
though is what was the part of your

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.760
school lunch you were most excited about

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:12.809
this is not that good but it does take

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.779
us closer to bookworm for me 100 percent

00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:17.980
number one a number one item sandwich

00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:21.069
mom would make me a sandwich for lunch

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.390
yeah all the way even into high school

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.459
my mom would make me a sandwich when I

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.890
way to school it's not like I breastfed

00:17:24.459 --> 00:17:28.360
until I was the agent 30 or something

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.809
like that but I understand that most

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.850
people probably didn't live that life

00:17:30.809 --> 00:17:38.350
your jealousies showing it's not very

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:39.279
becoming of you number two granola bar

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.980
absolutely

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:46.340
number three single piece of fruit or

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:49.289
cheese like an apple string cheese

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.630
number four now we're we're getting into

00:17:49.289 --> 00:17:54.899
the doldrums dude fruit snacks I know

00:17:51.630 --> 00:18:01.250
there are adults who eat them not my

00:17:54.899 --> 00:18:04.769
scene you know was like a top-tier lunch

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:08.010
when you were a kid cold fried chicken

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:09.330
like your parents brought home KFC the

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.230
night before or something like that and

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.000
they're like well there's two pieces of

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:15.149
chicken left we'll give you one to take

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.039
for lunch something about like the taste

00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:20.940
of cold fried chicken even to this day

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:31.559
is like this is a good school day even

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:33.809
as like a 28 year old now the irony of

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:34.980
course is that I could go buy my own KFC

00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:36.960
but I don't because I you know

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.409
Carrabelle my body's a temple and all

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.200
that

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:41.940
mostly it's actually that KFC is just

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:46.049
not that popular it's not a big fried

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:47.820
chicken city I hate it for that it's not

00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:50.850
that big I mean people here do they tend

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.320
to live myself excluded live healthier

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:56.460
lifestyles you know it's an outdoorsy

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.679
town but people still you know they

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:03.299
drink a lot of craft beer for example

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:05.090
not necessarily good for you the fried

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:10.769
chicken just hasn't popped off

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:13.710
we got a Church's take me to church is

00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:16.740
I'd like a tube he's meal with the fries

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:21.240
give me buttered biscuits that would be

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:26.760
really nice you thought I forgot about

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:32.549
that nah son okay this time 56% chance

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:35.820
deal with the devil I'm living my best

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:39.659
life okay we can't get an eternal heart

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:44.100
that's fine that was a very good start

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:45.860
to this fight a lot of momentum you're

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.409
not dead

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:53.899
he's dead we got HP no Krampus please

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:56.570
ooh um you gotta take first off you

00:19:53.899 --> 00:19:58.730
gotta be careful because if you get hit

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.129
by any of these fires after you take the

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.210
item you're gonna die so there's a

00:20:01.129 --> 00:20:03.739
couple of options we could take both

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.710
items and hope that guppies color keeps

00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:08.389
us alive we can take one item we can

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.519
take no items we're gonna take one item

00:20:08.389 --> 00:20:11.989
we're not gonna take the other copy item

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:14.409
even though the other guppy item would

00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:17.090
you know take us closer to being guppy

00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:18.649
God is saved to HP otherwise we've

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:21.259
completely squandered the existence of

00:20:18.649 --> 00:20:22.820
swallowed penny so this is not a run on

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:24.529
what you're gonna do boss rush I'm going

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:28.879
to avoid pudding you know that kind of

00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:33.080
hex on myself we did get up to negative

00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:39.049
1 lakh - so like this is a big step for

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:41.830
us statistically speaking no I want that

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:41.830
money thank you

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:46.279
of course if we can become guppy I'd

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.690
love to but we don't need to do boss

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:51.950
rush on this run that's just getting a

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:53.359
little overly ambitious instead don't

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.090
take the pills it could be health downs

00:20:53.359 --> 00:21:03.249
you madman instead you know take your

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:03.249
time stop

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:07.970
that was actually extremely scary and

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.040
you know the statistical speaking the

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.870
run still kind of bad like we've

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.920
improved and it's nice don't get me

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.980
wrong in that department

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.990
however you know we got 0.85 speed makes

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:21.980
it tough to dodge just calling it like I

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:26.990
see it guess we don't need keys actually

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:28.670
we should probably just I hate this cuz

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:32.930
if we get hit we still have to dodge to

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:35.810
the to the coin in order to heal

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.160
ourselves so fact we had no coins we

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.900
keep fighting these Boney's who are like

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.640
the most annoying enemy cuz they just

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:47.150
never stop shooting you

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:50.330
I gotta stop taking those dude you know

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:56.870
what we're sitting still yeah yeah how

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:58.850
you doing Tom Oh Tom Oh Rilke both cats

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.470
loving the sauna that is the room right

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.810
now you want a temperature check it's

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:07.240
like twenty eight it's not it's been

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:11.030
worse it's not good but it's been worse

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.100
quite a rainy day in Vancouver today so

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.820
this room is I guess it's cooled down by

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:19.490
proxy but still please there we go

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:24.640
alright enough vancouver talk man you

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:29.510
know what we could really use a single

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:35.270
tears upgrade speed high on the tier

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:37.090
list flying so we can more easily

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:41.120
maneuver to the coins we've earned

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:42.980
important but being able to shoot more

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.530
frequently it's just gonna have an

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:50.180
effect like a knock-on effect with so

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:53.030
many different aspects of this run you

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:55.610
know we'll get more boogers which i've

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:58.300
been told as a positive thing in this

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.300
situation

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:05.460
we'll kill enemies faster thank you for

00:23:05.129 --> 00:23:07.830
that

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.940
I don't want HP anything but HP I'm

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:12.059
talking range

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.279
give me range give me something that is

00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:21.450
banned or not amazing but contributes to

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:24.029
a transformation just very upset right

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:31.080
now you've given me something but it's

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:35.909
not the something I want okay ball of

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:37.710
tar not a strong item we definitely want

00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:43.049
to go to our shop as well this is of

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:44.279
nasty room and you know you think just

00:23:43.049 --> 00:23:46.259
because you get swallowed penny you got

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:48.539
the keys to the kingdom in many ways we

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:51.899
do were it not for swallowed penny we

00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:53.429
would be feeling the pain to a much

00:23:51.899 --> 00:23:57.719
greater degree than we already are

00:23:53.429 --> 00:24:00.539
oh my lord that worked but it doesn't

00:23:57.719 --> 00:24:03.269
give us guaranteed wins it just makes it

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:05.729
a lot we're a lot more insulated from

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:10.830
like likely losses where's invisible boy

00:24:05.729 --> 00:24:12.479
you might have blown up ya mad visit

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.830
that's supposed to be American Girl but

00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:16.440
instead it ended up being brown eyed

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:19.580
girl to Dib two very different girls

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.580
don't you get it confused

00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:23.969
don't you mean American woman I mean the

00:24:22.739 --> 00:24:27.289
one by Tom Petty

00:24:23.969 --> 00:24:27.289
you Philistine

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.720
you strawman Philistine great name for

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:41.270
an indie band

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:45.500
I need this coin I need this coin it

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:52.390
worked I was feeling quite vulnerable

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:52.390
there all that just to fight G read here

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:58.940
whatever I mean he's gonna eat it but

00:24:56.049 --> 00:25:01.120
it's very scared for part of that we

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:04.880
probably should have died on that room

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.860
the room before this I should say Excel

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.320
floor we know where everything is still

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.929
cannot even come close to make it at the

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.880
boss rush forget hush by the way we

00:25:11.929 --> 00:25:16.040
might want to go the negative path just

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.410
cuz we could accomplish more oh my god I

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:27.320
can't take an HP upgrade especially at

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:29.390
the cost of speed it's just like I don't

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.760
really want to fight the lamb and mega

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:34.160
Satan go all the way through Sheol we've

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:39.950
already done half of the light side path

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:41.570
so I think we should maybe try to knock

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.340
out as but not as much as we can for

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:45.440
like progress is sake but it's just like

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.530
it makes more sense you know if you got

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.540
a quiz worth 1% of your mark and an

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:53.059
assignment worth 10 they're both due on

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.440
the same day what are you gonna spend

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:57.410
the majority of your time working

00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:01.520
towards hold on I have a very important

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:02.990
person I've got very important messages

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.350
like my cellphone just sent me a text

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:08.450
and said battery power 5% you're gonna

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.820
say NL why don't you plug in your cell

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:13.280
phone it's a long story I have one

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:15.260
outlet near my side of the bed I

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.880
unplugged it last night to plug in an

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.320
electric blanket because my necks all

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.799
jacked up cuz I'm a hundred and eighty

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.809
years old never plugged it in later so

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:25.850
yeah my phone's on 5% what's it to you

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:27.559
every will you tell anybody about

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.059
anything in your life on the internet

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:31.070
there why don't you do it like this

00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:32.720
instead why am I your own beeswax and by

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:36.460
that I mean continue to watch and

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.460
support my content thank you very much

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:42.010
I'm sorry mr. customer is always right

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:59.490
okay stop this I just hate that I mean

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.080
we don't need the money of course take a

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:04.110
bunch of bombs even though I'm probably

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.590
pretty unlikely to use them got in like

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:12.270
a comical set of not really very useful

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:13.860
items on this floor I mean when the best

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:19.370
item you've gotten on the floor is Bala

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:21.600
Tarr you know it's gonna be a bit dicey

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:26.640
certainly no deal with the devil is to

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:30.360
be expected here bulgar tears not doing

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:34.100
a whole heck of a lot for us against

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.100
enemies that constantly disappear

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:45.429
no okay we didn't get hit I mean even if

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:47.289
we get here we get coins however it's

00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:52.500
not quite the lights out strap you might

00:27:47.289 --> 00:28:00.130
think it is please just like an orbital

00:27:52.500 --> 00:28:01.350
he's done it a single orbital makes this

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.390
so much easier

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:08.130
give me a tears upgrade give me a tea

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:14.880
give me any ears what's that spell tears

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:18.150
up got a rethink that one a little bit

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.150
he's done

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:27.220
we need the negative way don't we could

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:29.169
take either to be fair but I am like we

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.960
can't this runs not that bad

00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:36.850
it's not as bad on paper except for the

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:39.130
hole keeper aspect of it as the as the

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:44.580
Maggie run that we just finished is was

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:48.100
I should say uh that being said to

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:51.580
really really low DPS runs in a row your

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:54.730
boy is entering like a pit of morale

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.830
purgatory on either of these runs did we

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:59.650
stand a single chance on God's green

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:01.330
earth of ever entering boss rush or the

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:02.740
hush fight you might be saying NL you

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:06.309
got a chance to get the hush fight no

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:07.120
you you need to be logical this is not

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:11.320
gonna happen

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:13.960
I'm mister hush I'm mister boss rush we

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.220
can't make it it's a losing battle right

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:19.330
now you got to pick your battles that's

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:20.640
what people always say I'm bombing my

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.470
way through rooms not because they're

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:26.289
difficult but just because like I know

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:28.030
that all of us unless you know Ray

00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:29.980
Kurzweil gets his way I have a limited

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:32.080
amount of time on planet Earth

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:36.580
and I don't think we should spend it

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:39.100
fighting two chubs when we could be

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:42.850
spending at petting chubs twice as bare

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:45.419
taffies dog more chubs less chub that's

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.419
what I've always said

00:29:45.779 --> 00:29:51.179
ever since about maybe 11 seconds ago

00:29:52.769 --> 00:29:57.309
hello oh I see yeah I see you look at

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:03.820
you look at you

00:29:57.309 --> 00:30:06.820
please look at you the devil it's a good

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:10.359
card it's more than a good card when I

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:13.419
hear that old song I used to play a it's

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:15.429
it's an essential card it might be an

00:30:13.419 --> 00:30:18.489
essential card before the mega satan

00:30:15.429 --> 00:30:20.379
fight and that is very sad to think of I

00:30:18.489 --> 00:30:25.599
think we're better off not going back

00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:29.129
for that coin I wish it weren't so like

00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:31.329
Eagle Eye cherry and saved tonight but

00:30:29.129 --> 00:30:33.219
that was that was the better decision

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:36.129
this could be a hell of down we can't do

00:30:33.219 --> 00:30:37.749
it oh you know what I gotta take it just

00:30:36.129 --> 00:30:39.249
to spite myself you're gonna give me an

00:30:37.749 --> 00:30:40.809
are you a wizard pill in the rotation

00:30:39.249 --> 00:30:45.759
screw you dude yeah that's right give me

00:30:40.809 --> 00:30:48.820
a health up and also give me a tea give

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:51.629
me a hit we don't have to we don't have

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.629
to make that joke every time

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:58.359
okay 46% chance of a deal with the devil

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:03.399
as long as we don't take damage on the

00:30:58.359 --> 00:31:04.289
boss fight itself something not much but

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:07.419
it's something

00:31:04.289 --> 00:31:18.539
please don't be a difficult enemy this

00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:22.600
is pretty easy really it's just like no

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:23.859
no it's just mostly there goes our deal

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.619
with the devil but still it's mostly

00:31:23.859 --> 00:31:31.109
about stacking these boogers on there

00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:35.379
like an old couch a tears upgrade oh

00:31:31.109 --> 00:31:38.529
it's like less than a 20% upgrade but

00:31:35.379 --> 00:31:40.119
still in our present situation it might

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:47.850
as well have been like getting a second

00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:50.379
Christmas you might have noticed like

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:55.379
Wooden Nickel I wouldn't say it's like

00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:57.820
worn out its welcome it's not nearly as

00:31:55.379 --> 00:32:03.759
essential to the whole process as it

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:08.320
used to be and that's good means we can

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:10.299
rely on Swallow penny instead and it

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.659
swallowed penny has honestly been doing

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:16.299
gangbusters which i think is actually

00:32:13.659 --> 00:32:18.309
the proper way they use that word it's

00:32:16.299 --> 00:32:19.299
like myriad people always use myriad

00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:21.940
wrong they always say there have been

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:25.559
there have been a myriad of bloss no

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.559
it's just there's been myriad laws

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.590
I think I don't know what do I look like

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.110
I speak Aladdin I don't even know the

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:40.960
words to live in la vida loca except for

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:46.870
you know all of them actually now that I

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:49.180
think about it I think that song

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.890
promotes a weird message like it's

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.800
obviously a cautionary tale about Ricky

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:55.650
Martin you know having intercourse with

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.180
a dangerous woman yet at the same time

00:32:55.650 --> 00:33:00.040
really glosses over the fact that she

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.770
essentially drugged him she took my

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:05.080
heart as she took my money must've

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:12.360
slipped me a sleeping pill Ricky get out

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:20.140
it's not okay it's extreme she's

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:21.790
pharmaceutically assaulted you somehow

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.830
we got a deal with the devil there I am

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.240
amazed I'm not going any deeper down

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.910
that rabbit well I understand it's a

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.560
dangerous topic I'm just I'm saying it

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:33.700
in the whole song it's like feel-good

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:37.150
hit of the year livin la vida loca lady

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:43.570
drugged Ricky Martin it's extremely not

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:44.890
okay he's still in love with her after

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:48.320
all that as well it's just it's a

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:51.750
troubling tale that's all I'm saying oh

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:54.250
[Music]

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:59.920
just getting out of there I have no

00:33:54.250 --> 00:34:01.510
interest being destroyed on that room so

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.110
this is where things start to coalesce

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.110
for us

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:11.069
all we need to do is beat mega Satan if

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:19.210
you beat mega Satan we unlock something

00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:20.829
come on don't need any of this like I'm

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:24.040
saving bombs just in case we got a bomb

00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:26.919
through rooms down here now is it too

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:28.929
likely that we're gonna you know want to

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:34.629
use 16 bombs to get through rooms here

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:40.839
no it's pretty unlikely but not

00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:43.270
necessarily likely oh Jesus never gonna

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:45.129
need bombs for combat later I did dude

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.750
thank God for any invincibility we're

00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:54.990
getting right now that's all I'm saying

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:59.680
no no don't do it I'm so scared

00:34:54.990 --> 00:35:01.210
he's done it there was no reason for

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.140
that to be as frightening as it ended up

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:06.490
being but your boy was very nervous I

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:08.349
kind of want to pop the devil card here

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:12.550
but it's so much more useful in like the

00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:17.260
litany of situations that could sorry

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:20.220
the myriad situations that could show up

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.220
from this point onwards

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:32.430
excuse me they stole the booger tears no

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:37.010
respect okay should try to like you know

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:37.010
earn do not use this devil card

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:46.350
stay away from me

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:49.380
back off get your own sandwich one's got

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:52.020
to go not sure if you noticed we have

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:56.010
0.85 speed one of yous got to go

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:58.490
I can't dodge to you the speed stab will

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.490
not allow it

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:18.499
no no you will never get this just keep

00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:22.319
stacking those boobs dude

00:36:18.499 --> 00:36:25.559
hashtag who stacked the boobs it's

00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:28.440
looking you know I was gonna say it's

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:34.829
looking likely we'll win here but this

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:38.220
is the worst of all waves you know that

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:39.779
you know Charles Dickens like it's the

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:43.369
best of waves it's the worst of waves

00:36:39.779 --> 00:36:46.910
nah son this is just the worst of waves

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:50.239
I'm not that much of an optimist about

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:50.239
this at least

00:36:54.630 --> 00:37:08.180
they're so out of sync no let's go that

00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:11.940
one I dispute

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:14.070
can we talk about the 0.85 speed thing

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:17.850
because it's really starting to get you

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:24.300
know sneeze my cheese expression doesn't

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:29.310
make any sense but here I'm telling you

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:32.790
the feet SWOT like the second foot has

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:34.140
now become the leading foot I don't know

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.840
if it's like a you know they were

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.070
drafting or something like that okay so

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.460
we've made it yeah that's a funny joke

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.290
how about you take my funny joke and put

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.200
it in your mouth

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:51.900
game not audience store key that's good

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:55.950
it's something guppy dreams please no

00:37:51.900 --> 00:38:00.480
guppy dreams infested health dub it's

00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:03.720
not bad sort of what am i doing well I

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:09.240
kind of want to like although it's

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:14.820
torturous right now if I could beat the

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:16.440
lamb with keeper despite it being

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.240
annoying I would never have to do it

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.460
again obviously I want to beat mega

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.050
satan as well gotta be honest with you

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.430
i'm not a huge fan of our odds even with

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.440
the trump card of swallowed penny

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:28.350
working out like a hundred percent of

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.970
the time I'm also kind of hoping we beat

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.550
the odds somehow and just get like the

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:34.980
world's luckiest deals and buy deals I

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:37.200
mean items now you see like you can't

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:39.780
shoot bombs of me cuz it's just not fair

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:44.220
cuz I've 0.85 speed so I'm gonna spend

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:45.630
all my time shooting these bombs it's

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.870
gonna make it very difficult to put any

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:55.080
meaningful damage on you look at you

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:59.810
just gotta surround them with endless

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.810
booger tears of the mucosal varieties

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:10.280
more bombs

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:14.830
I would like no big rooms please not

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.830
realistic but would be nice just

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:31.840
surround him encase him in the detritus

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:36.560
of your nostrils it's working

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:39.110
Jake Lloyd Jeff that's right I know the

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.690
actor played young Anakin Skywalker get

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:52.310
out of here with that doubt who do you

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:56.020
think you are Cole Phelps you'll excuse

00:39:52.310 --> 00:40:00.230
the bereft nosov commentary right now

00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:01.940
sadly I have to focus on Isaac because

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:04.550
the last two runs have provided us with

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.680
essentially no strengths well I mean

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:08.630
they've they've both provided me with an

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:13.820
inability to die which is a pretty

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:17.470
strong trait in Isaac but you know it's

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.470
a little tedious to kill enemies as well

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:23.750
we've almost made it to the lamp fight I

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:26.090
give us like if we make it to the lamp

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:30.860
fight I think any room has about a

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:33.380
passive 1% chance to just end us like

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:41.390
via situation exactly like this yep okay

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:42.740
sure guppies scholar copies thanks for

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.900
watching hope you enjoyed the episode

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:47.000
maybe one of these days we'll get both

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.890
halves to the yin and yang of a keeper

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.730
run good damage and survivability for

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:50.570
now though thanks for watching hope you

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.530
enjoyed if you did click the like button

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.370
I'm sorry great - of course if you

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:55.540
haven't seen more in the future but for

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.540
now they squadron I'll see you next time
