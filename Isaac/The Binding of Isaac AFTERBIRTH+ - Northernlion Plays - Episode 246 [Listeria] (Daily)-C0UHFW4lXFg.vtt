##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.029
everybody welcome back to lion place

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.290
with money wise Gareth plus daily time

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.809
scores look good today oh my god it's a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.250
mega satan run with that in mind the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.230
scores actually don't look that good top

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.049
school right now 58,000 yesterday's

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.690
daily we moved up one spot on the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.240
leaderboards closer to the top forty

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.970
fifth overall 0.52% raising our overall

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.300
average to four point two nine fairly

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.510
good we have not in our last 10 Daly's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.719
had a Daly that was under four point two

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.860
nine or I mean over worse than four

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.180
point two nine it's kinda hard when

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.320
you're dealing with percentages I guess

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.520
um except for May 5th which was six

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.649
point eight six because I didn't find

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.690
the scene that's fair okay let's get

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.460
going here

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.950
it's a Judas right okay so that's the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.710
rub the Judas runs are always a little

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.539
scary when you first get started because

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.829
obviously there's a lot of enemies who

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.140
could actually just kill you instantly

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.640
but I find the more you focus on the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.630
fact that you could die in one hit the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.979
more likely you are to die early on you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.750
know you get you start second-guessing

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.619
yourself when you take a dodj oh can I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.680
go here oh you know I'm dead don't do

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.680
that you gotta you gotta play your cards

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.240
right believe in the power of human

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.680
instinct you know I've played enough

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.150
Isaac to know that guys got to go but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.150
now I've played enough Isaac to know

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.650
that you should dodge away from bullets

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.380
not into them and I played enough Isaac

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.970
to know that I want tears up graves not

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.320
range upgrades this was meant to be an

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.270
inspirational speech it's not really

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.040
coming across that way I had a feeling

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.119
that we would be fighting a boss who's a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.670
little bit of a jerk

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.530
little horn is not the worst of all

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.920
bosses on the first floor definitely

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:58.880
like a champion rag man could be worse

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.469
but not the easiest boss either although

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.200
we sort of made it look a little easier

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.899
there of course that's not a hero font

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.090
card which is frightening so what are we

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.190
looking for now well a bomb in the key

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.090
or a penny and a key will do it I'm

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.450
hoping to get into our

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.790
a shop and use our shop as a launching

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.420
pad to grab a spear at heart the other

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.950
thing that could happen is our item room

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.260
which we have not yet gone to could

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.209
contain HP or it could contain something

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.129
that gives us spirit hearts you know

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:41.129
what is a a worthy room to pop this a

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.610
little concerning these enemies are the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.489
enemies that ended like two streaks ago

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.599
by the way I can't remember it was a

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.700
champion I suppose but they can hurt you

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.870
worse than you would expect backstabber

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.790
is not what I'm looking for so you have

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.170
options here you look for rocks down

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.329
there I didn't see it tinted rock

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.849
because we're going pretty fast here

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.989
pretty quickly I'm going to look for a

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.370
spirit heart as well just in case this

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.940
is the one where you have your friend

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.940
play it and then you go hey buddy can

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.920
you go into that curse room for me and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.630
it's not a half spirit out no can you go

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.010
into the curse room for me and let me

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.450
know if there's a spirit aren't in there

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.720
that would be great because if they die

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.650
it's not your daily so no big deal right

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.389
and if they don't die then you get to

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.970
learn something about today's daily one

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.040
bomb for two cents it actually could be

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.109
the right call but I'm gonna look for

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.880
the second secret room instead the

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.950
second secret room has granted me tonsil

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.739
I'm going to go with canes I instead but

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.690
it's a bit of a bummer let's get down to

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.609
the next floor so at least if we don't

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.700
die we also don't fall far behind

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:06.430
schedule here curse of the blind I did

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.590
use my bomb uh whether or not I would do

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.160
that again I don't know because the bomb

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.799
also like if we find cool if we find a

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.730
tinted rock we would like to have a bomb

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.730
but hopefully we'll get one

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.099
you're not you're done pennies I mean

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.150
this yep

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:34.330
that's fair this is the right time for

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.020
us to pop this pill its verb which is

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.789
given us a verb pill we should fight the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:47.500
boss honestly now don't freak out it's

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.550
pin pin is easy we don't have a great

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.900
chance of getting our deal with the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.289
devil here obviously but we got it

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.150
anyway

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.259
we got a range upgrade I don't even know

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.280
if I want to fight this because it could

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.419
be you know Krampus dude what's up with

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.720
this daily though you know what though

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:09.370
this is actually almost specifically the

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.840
daily archetype that I asked for I asked

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.699
for if you're going to give us bad

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.000
dailies give us dailies with no HP don't

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.940
give us dailies with no damage so this

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.169
is where we would have used our bomb and

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.300
with one spear at heart we could have

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:29.110
actually grabbed Oh what we got algae's

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.120
very important actually we can get

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.340
dunked on in like a second here so be

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.969
careful but at the same time it would be

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.500
very nice to not use our algae's room so

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.840
just keep yourself as far back as you

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.750
can't do one bomb could be the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.280
difference-maker here it's a judgement

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.560
call to use the bomb to look for a

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.819
second secret room like I did it's a

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.050
bummer that it didn't work out but

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:58.719
that's the way the cookie crumbles you

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:01.360
know it's a big room we're not far

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:05.469
behind schedule thanks to our four point

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.370
seven two damage I don't think I could

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.750
conceivably just don't want to get hit

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.699
by the spider I don't think I could

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.530
conceivably have many more points than I

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:20.669
already do it's getting a little

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.509
ridiculous on this room

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:26.939
aqui aqui is an item room or a shop for

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:34.259
a spirit heart okay this is where you

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:38.789
use this I don't want to use this and

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:44.219
the book of Belial but as we approach

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:46.710
the end of algae's please die without

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:51.389
having killed every single enemy I get a

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:54.810
little scared here I don't dude I think

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:59.460
we should just go back and you go item

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:05.669
room where do you go shop I think you go

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:08.550
shop and there's no bomb for sale but

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:11.969
there's a 3-cent spirit heart with a key

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.639
then you use your key come in here you

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:17.759
grab black bean all that for black bean

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:21.300
I would suggest that that is a

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:27.150
suboptimal outcome we do want to go back

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.800
for the verb pill and we're going to be

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.129
a little bit behind schedule as a result

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.969
of this but dude this floor just living

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:40.560
through this floor is going to give us a

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:43.469
big leg up that hit me a big leg up on

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.800
the competition locust of pestilence is

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:48.360
probably better okay I think a lot of

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.430
people are not going to make it through

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.800
this floor it's not the easiest floor of

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.439
all time things might change if you've

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.879
got a spirit heart here or sorry if you

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:58.229
brought your bomb down and then you've

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.330
got a spirit heart out of that attempted

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:01.229
rock maybe you maybe you took the deal

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.729
with the devil I don't know what the

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:04.229
deal with the devil could possibly be to

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:08.580
make you excited but it could be

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:13.919
something we did not get that and as a

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:15.270
result find myself in times of trouble

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:19.969
with Mother Mary

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:22.009
comforting me singing words of wisdom

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:25.680
squeezy

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:26.840
please squeeze EE please please e do

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.910
please squeezy

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:38.450
new squeezy I will say it slower please

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:40.700
squeezy you know because we need not so

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:45.640
much that tears upgrade although

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:48.529
wouldn't be too upset to find it but

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.660
some spirit hearts would be real nice

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:53.830
right now and you know some bombs as

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.830
well I mean we've got tinted rocks

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:04.779
we got enough keys so a good item room

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:04.779
wouldn't perturb me at this point either

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:12.529
do they all have to be diagonal shooters

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.510
they're made my life slightly more

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:16.640
difficult

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:19.070
speaking of which yellow locust the

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:24.440
pestilence this is your time to shine

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:26.330
murder one of these dudes thank you okay

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.890
so first half of the floor handled

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.100
pretty well we still can't go into that

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:39.800
room our inability to go into curse

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:44.000
rooms is frustrating but also I find

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.279
this daily quite engaging the reason I

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.300
find it engaging is because it's so

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:53.330
difficult you know that oh that's a

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.920
spirit our territory you can't just walk

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.900
into your first item room on this daily

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.250
and come out with an item that's going

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.200
to allow you to go all the way you know

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.050
no wonder the scores were a little bit

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.330
lower today then you would expect from a

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.920
oh that's the good stuff then you would

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.060
expect from a mega Satan run you know

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.550
it's not guaranteed that we're going to

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:15.680
be able to get to boss rush also

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:20.779
apparently even the tinted rocks are

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.430
working against us here I don't I mean

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:26.270
this is what happens you know you get so

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:28.279
desperate for items that you start to

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:31.420
look at that and go maybe that's a good

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:31.420
use of our two keys

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:40.100
I would disagree though Maury this guy's

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.290
store enough potential energy and he's

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.239
going to run wild on us

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.649
obviously strange attractor one of the

00:10:44.239 --> 00:10:48.739
best items in the game so we're going to

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:56.059
go with that never proptosis though okay

00:10:48.739 --> 00:11:02.809
so that changes things drastically we

00:10:56.059 --> 00:11:09.019
need to get to the shop we can get to

00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:14.779
the shop we should be fine you know even

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:18.230
just buying a red heart is okay but for

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:20.799
now like just living continues to be a

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:25.299
little bit of an ass thank you

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:29.959
there's our shop as well no spirit heart

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:31.790
we don't really want sharp plug you can

00:11:29.959 --> 00:11:33.859
blow them up for five cents but again

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.929
I'm not really convinced that we want

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:40.249
that a tinted rock seems so much more

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:41.869
valuable now it's a little cocky but the

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:43.220
fact that we now have two spirit arts

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:45.079
that we just picked up for the cost of a

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.269
single bomb almost makes me think that

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:51.230
we have won this run it's the first time

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:53.179
we've ever had this much survivability I

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.319
can almost go to a curse room I'm not

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:57.289
going to do it on this floor because

00:11:54.319 --> 00:12:04.789
that seems like I'm just inviting

00:11:57.289 --> 00:12:06.199
disaster there's probably a second

00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:07.910
secret room there but you know what so

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:10.970
be it there will continue to be a second

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.889
secret room there for the time being

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:16.699
that was really bad on my part I'll

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:18.319
accept that mr. dolly could be big even

00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:19.970
one black heart is good in the tiers

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:21.709
upgrade is nice as well oh and then you

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:26.199
got to go brimstone I mean I would like

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:26.199
to go both but you have to go brimstone

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:32.449
all right so I think that's our reward

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:33.739
for living this long now we're 40

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:39.379
seconds behind schedule which is

00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:42.350
actually a little slow for a for a Judas

00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:43.879
run if I'm being honest but that's our

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.800
reward for having lived long enough to

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:46.240
get to this point

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.990
to be honest with you we kind of needed

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.000
it because if we didn't get here if we

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.920
didn't get this stacked I think we would

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.050
be pretty screwed pretty soon I don't

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.040
know if this bomb will get it it did get

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:01.690
it okay now losing contract from below

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.910
actually means that one of the best

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:07.899
seams on this run to get more points at

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:09.279
the very least is just to have taken so

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:11.890
little damage and it really would

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:16.860
require you know you'll be in a pretty

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:19.000
good spot but take so little damage that

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.380
you could actually afford to take

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.769
contract from below without putting

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:26.050
yourself too far out you know like David

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:27.519
Bowie's moonage daydream chorus well

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.860
it's more of a break down at the end but

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:31.209
okay this so I did use bombs of key I

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.750
don't really want to use verb to get

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:39.839
bombs or key back it's not really a

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:41.980
major cost here I do think that almost

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:44.350
just because of the fact that we're

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.320
alive we got a chance to be top 100 top

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:49.329
200 today winning a Judas run is not

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.250
that hard but usually if you're going to

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:53.560
win as you just run you know you don't

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.910
spend the first three floors scrounging

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.220
for a spear at hard to keep yourself

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.050
alive so I think that a lot of people

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.110
are going to be under the gun there and

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.890
we were as well but luckily we managed

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.620
to make it out

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.839
r.i.p anyone who for whatever reason

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.480
took strange attractor I don't know

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:15.490
you know the stomach so that was pretty

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:17.500
dumb sometimes if you make a mistake on

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.329
a daily I weep for you you know

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.020
especially if it's like hey I got a deal

00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:22.270
with the devil

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.620
you stupid idiot it turns out you were

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.600
not supposed to get a deal with the

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.640
devil the right play was to be bad for

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.199
the first floor and then they just give

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.209
you a mom's knife or something on the

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:33.160
third floor deal with the devil

00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:36.640
need locus de pez floats kind of needs

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:39.190
you here thank you but if you're taking

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.740
that if you're taking strange attractor

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:47.260
I don't know what to tell you range

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:49.420
upgrade that's useless but okay keep in

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:54.010
mind because it goes to mega Satan we do

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:55.750
have we got a desire to fight hush and

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.810
we're definitely going to do boss rush

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:03.100
as well so it's a bit of a longer

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:07.150
optic daily here got a long way to go is

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:10.240
what I'm trying to say for bombs you

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:12.190
know we could probably did proptosis

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.020
brimstone damage at the end of the beam

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.150
is not that strong but we could probably

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.850
start to look for secret rooms here that

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:24.970
seems likely it will not be there it

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:29.470
could be here and was indeed I think we

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:31.420
should use a bomb here two cents for one

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.860
bomb is not horrible but it's not what I

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.240
was looking for and now we're going to

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.340
be like ten seconds behind schedule

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.940
which means that we gained like 30

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.950
seconds on this floor so no complaints

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:46.260
we've got three bombs back anyway we

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:48.820
should basically use bombs always here

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.920
they will only give us consumables that

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:55.500
are more valuable than bombs even if we

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:57.790
just get pennies okay so four bombs now

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.550
having gone to every room but you know

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:03.220
you got a you got to pick your battles

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.450
right now I think and the second secret

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.130
room is a battle I'm not going to pick

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.110
because it looks a little bit stupid

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:10.300
it's going to take us a little while to

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:16.330
get to the the plausible locations for

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:20.520
that so instead we're just not going to

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:23.080
do that it's actually a terrible room

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.640
when you have brimstone and not the

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:30.340
world's fastest rate of fire a rate of

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:32.530
fire is actually pretty great but

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:39.220
teratoma is one of the the hard counters

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:41.410
I guess what we need is like well we

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.870
don't need it we don't really need much

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:47.020
on this run to be honest with you but if

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:50.020
we could get it this lump of coal brim

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:53.130
like counteracts I didn't get hit on

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:56.700
that one did I I don't think so

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:59.200
does lump of coal brim counteract the

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.300
badness of bring proptosis because bring

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.830
proptosis is actually awesome until you

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:08.910
catch him on the very end of your like

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:08.910
infinity range beam at which point they

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.790
take like literally negative 100 damage

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:24.520
most of the time it's pretty great

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:25.900
though you got to look for these secret

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.910
rooms you got to look for the tinted

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:31.450
rocks as well there is a small chance

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:34.270
that this could be a secret room it is

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.830
and we've got eight bombs so I'm not

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.120
sweating it either way there's no chance

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:47.050
that's going to be a secret room on our

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:49.660
like the underside here I'm starting to

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.000
sweat boss rush but honestly it wouldn't

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.910
be a northernlion Isaac Daly if I wasn't

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.490
sweating boss rush a little bit that's

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.260
that's the way she goes now I am

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.620
sweating the fact that I can't seem to

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.300
get into an item room here and you know

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.620
what I'm not just I mean I'm using the

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.590
word sweating to the point where it's

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.210
lost all meaning but seriously I do have

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.130
hyperhidrosis I don't actually have

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.860
hyperhidrosis I mean to make light of a

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.820
condition that's the condition of

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.120
sweating a lot

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:22.810
I don't sweat that much but I do

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:26.190
overheat very easily you know I get I'm

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:29.970
comfortable at colder temperatures I

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:32.590
think it's a fairly common male thing I

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:35.590
knew that you know not that it's male

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.750
specific but I knew a guy though when I

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:40.510
worked in Korea who actually kept his

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.380
home which was you know an apartment so

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.910
it was easy enough to do

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.590
thermodynamically speaking but he kept

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.490
his apartment at like 32 degrees Celsius

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:50.200
I always thought he was out of his mind

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.210
you're the one who's out gobby out of

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.830
his mind we're not going to go to any

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.820
special rooms on this floor and you're

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.350
going to think that that's a

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.270
capitulation you're going to think

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.850
that's a mistake and largely you are

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:04.000
correct however we have almost no choice

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:08.290
in the matter we got to keep our pace up

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.290
similarly boss rush also requires some

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:17.490
HP and although I have taken some damage

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:20.260
I also just feel like we have not really

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:23.080
had an easy go of things when it comes

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.740
to stacking up hearts so the only times

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.290
it's live

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.940
to be relevant our boss rush and then

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:32.770
you know probably the hush fight

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:34.840
depending on how things go but it's a

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:39.820
little little dire this is where we

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:42.160
spend two of spades smelter so that's a

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.050
free locus of wrath or sorry locus of

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.630
pestilence basically and then diplopia

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.580
but diplopia i mean that's a verb pill

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:55.120
into a verb pill diplopia gives us a key

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:57.700
here I think how valuable is book of

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.290
Belial well for boss thrush specifically

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.290
I would say it's pretty valuable

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:12.730
however diplopia on boss rush can also

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:15.280
be wonderful are we losing a lot from a

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.950
point standpoint by not taking the

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.530
smelter I don't believe so

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.120
like I would like to play you we don't

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.620
have the money for it for one well now

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.350
we do after blowing you up perhaps

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:33.400
ironically but the second thing is we

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:37.990
have to go fast boss rush really founded

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:39.640
so we will probably get to it but we

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.640
have to kill it as well which is going

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.020
to take some time here mom's no problems

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.290
we can just stand right next to her and

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:50.860
you know light her up with the with the

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:52.750
brimstone proptosis but everything else

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.550
is a bit dicey here so I it's nice to

00:20:52.750 --> 00:21:00.280
have 20 bombs it makes it pretty likely

00:20:54.550 --> 00:21:01.780
we will be able to make the the hush

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.300
fight because we can always skip rooms

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:07.809
that are you know close to being bad for

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.640
us we need to go pretty soon but I can't

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:17.220
feel good about skipping this many item

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:20.020
rooms and I'm really also eager to get

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.120
tinted rocks if they exist which so far

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.070
has been a little questionable there we

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:28.059
go there's our item room blow this up I

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:30.309
got a good feeling two cards mom's

00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:32.340
perfume it does lower our tier cap the

00:21:30.309 --> 00:21:34.330
mom transformation means nothing to me I

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.130
think you got to stick with two of

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.630
spades alright let's get down here make

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.810
this happen you know that's going to be

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.940
a

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.610
secret rooms so we should probably peep

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.410
it pretty quickly here go fast okay I

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.300
should not have done that but he died in

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:48.160
like no time flat and we got a luck

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:52.230
upgrade so actually we did the right

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.850
thing so we are now saying goodbye

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.040
everything and hello diplopia

00:21:54.850 --> 00:22:00.250
with curse of the blind so that's a

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:09.190
little scary but who dares wins on a

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:12.670
daily like this probably easy fights we

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:14.230
can actually fight Krampus yeah we'll

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:17.260
have time if this is Krampus we have

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:20.040
time it's not Grammys you can't oh wait

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.780
wait free deals of the devil take them

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:27.220
go ahead

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:29.830
shade headless baby dude this was a

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.720
terrible deal where's my where's my

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:35.350
Avedon's you're gonna make me take

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:40.300
damage to pick up one of these let's go

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:42.690
bottom right robo-baby 2.0 dude money

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.690
well-spent

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:52.920
what a classic item robo-baby 2.0 it

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.920
just rolls off the tongue

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:05.830
okay so perhaps fair to suggest in

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:11.440
today's daily fortune doesn't really

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:14.430
favor the bold how are we going to get

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.430
out of this one dude

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:28.380
we're probably going to die right now

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:32.740
I don't know me

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:38.470
the thing with diplopia is it would have

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:40.570
been nice to use it on boss rush that

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.310
hurts me that hurts me first off our

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.280
ranks are really close together which is

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:47.740
nice dude honestly it hurts me but

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.680
today's daily was fun so I'm not overly

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.090
concerned and our rank isn't even that

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.460
bad all things considered but today's

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:58.270
daily was fun more like this good

00:23:54.460 --> 00:24:00.160
