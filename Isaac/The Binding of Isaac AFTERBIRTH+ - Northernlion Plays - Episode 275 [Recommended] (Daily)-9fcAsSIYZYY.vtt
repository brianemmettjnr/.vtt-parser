##

00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.929
everybody welcome excellent lamp is my

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.040
name I began to read plus his daily time

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.250
and yesterday we didn't do amazing we

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.590
came 1126 we did badly let's just be

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.039
honest and we're still in the top 100

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.830
amazingly but today apparently the daily

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.750
is very good and also sin VIX is ranked

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.099
like I mean he was high on today's daily

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.170
doesn't seem like he's on the front page

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.340
of the daily anymore just give me a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.270
second your sin Victor it's a Maggi run

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.610
it goes to mega Satan he's ranking 120

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.270
today but he took a picture when he was

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.500
like ranked 25 so you know we're on the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
use of Victor's all I'm trying to say

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.620
but doing a daily let's go is the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.379
perfect run to keep my sea legs

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.010
underneath me as we get back to being

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.289
hopefully like not bad at Isaac again

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.000
well you have to go with the d4 it's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.489
just you know the science of the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.390
situation the scores do they range from

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.339
like the top one was like 63,000 and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.020
then the bottom one on the front page so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.680
like 30th place or something like that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.430
was 53,000 so all of the scores are like

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.799
very very close together it's usually an

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.880
indication of a daily in which it's very

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.049
obvious to find the right way to go

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.250
which means to me and I'm not going to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.560
try to reverse-engineer I'm just going

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.100
to try to play by feel here but the d4

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.960
is probably not a part of what makes

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.840
this work however using the d4 to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.170
re-roll bad items into hopefully useful

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.970
items is a fairly sensible tactic so if

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.799
we find ourselves you know getting a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.049
shot speed upgrade from the boss we

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.759
might want to roll out a quick d4 and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.869
then eventually replace our space bar

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.090
item with something a little bit more

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.040
valuable for now though three tinted

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.750
rocks from the first floor and amazingly

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.310
enough bombs to actually take advantage

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.070
of them all probably gates us out of the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.119
secret room but also hoping and some

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.750
likely but I was going to say I'm hoping

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.160
we'll be able to pick up a little bit

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.680
more money here so we can get an arcade

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
on the next floor it doesn't have to be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.849
imagine boy although I wouldn't turn out

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.500
my nose at it this Dingell fight not the

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.750
easiest fight in the world this is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.349
dangle sorry Dingle something completely

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.069
different

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.349
you stupid idiot Dingles the brown poop

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.109
dangles the slightly yellowish brown

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.530
poop as if he consumed a diet that was

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:38.810
high in fat for the previous gestational

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.810
period of a fecal bowel movement okay

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.590
damages I mean subpar this is par for

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.359
the course amazingly and I'm going to be

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.389
subpar and then also par for the course

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.609
I mean it's a great question the answer

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.819
to that question is basically we're just

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:58.439
Maggie we're just a vanilla Maggie right

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:05.430
now hey now vanilla Magdalen turned that

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:08.280
s up so Zach Della Rocca said in rage

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.519
against the machines magnum opus vanilla

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.189
Magdalen let's go you should be dead I

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.659
didn't get hit somehow he's dead we

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.180
didn't take too long here straight up

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:22.049
grab it we roll yourself son

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.000
technology that's well I just have to

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.290
cut off my desk it was a paper cup so it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.239
made a sound like paper hitting the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.699
ground we're have been way worse if that

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.229
was an actual glass and by the way I

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.229
know people are going to be like you rag

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:36.599
Don Robert for using paper plates and

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:39.930
you've got a paper cup it's from some

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.959
takeout that's one of the justifiable

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.639
situations so I'm not necessarily like

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.919
thinking technology wins us the game

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.359
here but I think reroll in a single HP

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.509
upgrade after we've already gotten the

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.449
HP from it into effectively piercing

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:56.909
shots is actually quite good we get the

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.799
right combination of items on this floor

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.650
via deal with the devil or otherwise we

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.229
can you know start to basically be off

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.389
to the races this run has to get good

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:09.090
fast otherwise the scores don't make

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.560
sense magic mush I can take it early I'm

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.569
just choked and we're going to take it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.669
so in taking magic mush we're basically

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.320
making a contract to the game that says

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.329
we are not going to use the d4 again so

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.240
we're looking to replace that as soon as

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:25.430
possible hermit card is a lovely pickup

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.810
for getting out of a curse room without

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.280
taking as much damage you might as well

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.460
see what's going on in here I mean let's

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.139
be real we are well ahead of where we

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.460
should be on the average run right now

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.440
and this is a kind of run I'm looking

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.970
for right now and you know what I don't

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.870
know if this is a curated daily or what

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.810
but thank you thank you Nicholas

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.130
Nicholas is the janitor at the company

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.979
that made the binding of issac

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.930
afterbirth know Thank You Nicholas for

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.030
this daily assuming that it's as

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.099
excellent as it seems to be so far oh

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.080
you got to give me a little mom's knife

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.039
action on top of that let's take a

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.470
little delirium he's delirious so

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:08.900
technology and mom's knife do synergize

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.520
apparently I think we have a golden key

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.389
so it's not really doing too much for us

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:22.190
to do this but I will spend to go in

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:23.090
here crack it open crack it open that's

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.569
so good

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.550
we needed an item to replace the d4 so

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.650
we didn't accidentally use it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.750
we have no bombs left so we can't blow

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.979
up the tinted or not tinted rock but

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.220
like anything over here to get the

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.500
golden chests open which is the shame

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.210
but we do have a guppy item and that's

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.199
great news we might as well come back

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.090
down here all right so this run

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.180
basically cannot be stopped at this

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.639
point hush boss rush the world's our

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.139
oyster deal with the devil is great this

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.370
is only the second floor and our stats

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.159
are through the roof we got mom's knife

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.300
we got magic mush

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:00.460
three of my favorite admins in the game

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.620
magic and mushroom and mom's knife

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.360
why does moms knife count as one when

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.919
magic mushroom counts as two just but

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.789
you look I don't make up the rules as I

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.490
go okay it's a so whose line is in

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:15.590
anyway sort of situation so I'll tell

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.400
you straight up in a hindsight I don't

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.039
think we should have taken little

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.419
delirium it's one of those things that

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.919
will probably be incredibly minor but

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.659
little delirium can turn into Bob's

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:31.130
brain which is can cause us to take

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:33.229
damage so and you know what as far as is

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.380
is some day today it's a weekend my

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.410
anniversary is tomorrow thank you

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.580
your clap and applause comedians always

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.880
do that I'm not saying I'm a comedian

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.970
now is go Ameri to my wife for 52 years

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.190
and then the audience goes well and they

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.780
go thank you thank you if you knew it

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.970
wouldn't be anything to applaud about

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.740
and then everybody laughs and this was

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.680
not a good use of a bomb and you know

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:00.640
it's the classic gold trope but as far

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.720
as I'm concerned if every everybody has

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.910
a good day today

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.480
then I'm a happy camper I don't need to

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.700
win in the leaderboard positions and

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.400
make other people feel badly about it

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.500
I do take bows oh I don't understand it

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.540
but I take it occasionally maybe gives

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:25.720
you rainbow poop jury's out my jury is

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:28.090
out at least I found pills well yeah you

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.960
know if everybody gets over 50,000 a day

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.760
and I end up ranking 300 dude that is

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.080
completely fine as far as I'm concerned

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.520
I'm not going to worry about nickel and

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.770
diming this run to make sure that we get

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.780
the the best possible chance to rank

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.130
highly unless it looks like we're

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.630
definitely going to in which case

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.260
obviously we're going to make an effort

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.830
for it

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:52.470
so technology guppy is great it's my

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.470
favorite skin for guppy in overwatch

00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:04.930
let's go um and I walk into a red poop

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:07.210
what did I walk into a spider just try

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:11.490
to figure out what happened there we

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.490
should stop taking dumb damage obviously

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.850
let's blow this up thought maybe Willie

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.950
you silly do blow this up grab the

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.530
nickel now you want the sf4 you want

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.620
champion belt I'm of the opinion BFF is

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:28.750
a more fun item than champion belt but

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.720
I'll accept that they're both great here

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:34.360
I would take either use way too many

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.190
bombs there and honestly from a score

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.630
standpoint we're probably pulling up the

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.650
rear a little bit here please make me

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.849
guppy right now and give me a chance to

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:45.700
get this early gum stir going

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:47.380
something's wrong tears down actually

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.150
completely buying it all admit we

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.230
botched a little bit on this floor

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.460
but I'm going to choose not to worry

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.470
about it too much because we're a sad

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.650
clown with a knife and I don't want to

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:59.230
make myself angry in that situation nine

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.150
lives is a huge get here obviously and

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.680
I'm very excited to have it where one

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.150
item away from becoming Guffey we don't

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.050
have extra deal with the devil chance

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.670
but you know we got high apple pie in

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.400
the sky hope certainly we can afford to

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:16.750
go to that's fine

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.880
certainly we can afford to go to well

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.050
not this room sadly and we also will not

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.220
have an arcade but certainly we can

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.600
afford to go to curse rooms to try to

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.220
make that dream come true as well

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.510
and I'm not going to sweat the damage

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.770
too much I'm just kind of a fun daily

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:31.990
today I think we should take this this

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:36.610
is like the most stacked daily I've ever

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:38.890
seen and I say that almost without like

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.230
a hint of self-awareness this might

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:45.280
actually be the strongest daily I've

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:49.540
ever seen considering we're on the caves

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.900
- we may just want to go into the shop

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.830
the off-chance of the shop is actually

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.300
like a greed fight that could give us

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.280
some money here this daily is going to

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.050
be great and it helps to alleviate my

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.920
own personal conspiracies that's not

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.360
even a shop got confused by the map it

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.880
helps alleviate my own personal

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.310
conspiracy theory that the game has

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.370
somehow clandestinely become harder but

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.600
wouldn't they want you to think that you

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.250
know then give it a little float of an

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.190
easy daily today throw them off the

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:24.070
scent you know that Nicholas he's a

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:27.340
sneaky sanitation engineer let's go

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:29.290
let's go that's not guts still very

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.240
solid if you guys want it because I know

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.530
people are probably going NL stop saying

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.740
let's go it's getting annoying

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:38.290
it's either let let's go or sit your ass

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.120
down we'll do one of the two you all

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.760
allow you to choose because I respect

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.130
you and because you know basically my

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.200
income in existence are pretty much

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.330
beholden to you at this point so I'll

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.440
allow you to choose excited let's go or

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.440
sit your ass down

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:01.589
check this we want it to be great

00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:03.740
oh that's that's the secret that's where

00:11:01.589 --> 00:11:07.470
the run comes together it's restock

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.879
restock restock restock really suck but

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.589
if you wanted that to be good Johnny by

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:13.199
men at work except like some really

00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:16.920
poorly if you want to revitalize let's

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:19.769
go search Don sherry let's go

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:24.809
Don sherry is like are in Canada at

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:28.350
least these are 95 year old hockey

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:29.910
commentator who rags on Europeans for

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.179
wearing visors we're not going to have

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:36.829
enough money to buy restock which might

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:38.879
actually be like a pretty bad thing but

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:40.379
there's not much we can do about it so

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:43.499
we'll just move along here that chest

00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:45.600
was inaccessible I think you've got a

00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:46.920
song from a series of videotapes used to

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.230
sell through late-night infomercials

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.399
called Rock'em Sock'em where it's just

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:55.309
body checks and fights non-stop and

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:58.170
during the height of really really bad

00:11:55.309 --> 00:12:00.749
mainstream rap in the early 1990s and

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.459
I'm not talking about NWA I'm not

00:12:00.749 --> 00:12:06.119
talking about Public Enemy I'm talking

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:10.499
about snow I'm selling out my own

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:13.799
Canadian you know brother here but made

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:17.399
a really ill-advised rap about body

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:18.089
checks you know it can shoot he can

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:22.920
score

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:28.199
holy cow it's Bobby Orr let's go let's

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:30.420
go is give it a try like it is uh it's a

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:32.490
classic and it is revitalized the let's

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.309
go meta for me I've been familiar with

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.290
that video for probably like maybe five

00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:43.949
or six years by now but gets better

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:46.949
every time and by that I mean it really

00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:48.959
gets really really really really bad

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:50.429
after like the third time and then the

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:52.350
irony kicks in and it starts to get

00:12:50.429 --> 00:12:54.660
better so that's a tough call isn't it

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:58.170
there we got a little blank card action

00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:01.110
blank card is a great point

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.910
enabler and admittedly if we become

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.769
guffy we don't really need three extra

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:08.839
extra flies for a room we're going to

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.839
you know crush it from a fly standpoint

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:16.529
compass was pretty cheap too and we will

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.020
actually be able to with our existing

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:20.279
bombs get over there and make that blank

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.410
card happen the only question is if we

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:24.649
want to give up Guppies head for it

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:29.750
right now is offensively pretty good

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:31.770
that could change either way I feel like

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.690
we're in the driver's seat like a

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:37.170
million percent on this run it's so

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.670
solid right now I would just like to it

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.290
doesn't it to be W but if you just want

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.959
to give me the ability to fly right off

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.700
the bat I think that's solid and then

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:46.770
we'll get blank card maybe buy the card

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.399
and the compass from the shop see what

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.500
they are

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:52.020
monstro to you should be dead in like

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.580
zero seconds here we're going to this is

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.899
like one of the very few dailies in

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.550
which I'm not even going to have to

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:57.750
worry about making it the boss rush

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.500
because we're going to make it the boss

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.820
rush so quickly in the case we made for

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.010
taking brother Bobby there but I don't

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.570
think it's worth it I do think sucky bus

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.220
damage bonus is pretty sweet

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:11.850
assuming they actually synergizes one

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:14.670
another tell you well buy the card first

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.560
called in the compass with buy the card

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:22.470
strength blank card strength

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:25.320
well Chicka wash away the rain black a

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.690
little strength I know it's not the

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.880
right week to be making a satirical

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.100
black hole Sun reference RFP to Chris

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.980
Cornell lead singer of Soundgarden

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:38.570
audioslave's solo ventures you know a

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:44.970
hallmark of the grunge scene in Seattle

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:48.000
sad news it's all a blank card on soos

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:50.130
though it's also one of those news items

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.220
that scares me because and I don't I'm

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:55.560
not trying to trivialize you know a

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.329
celebrity death at all you know when I

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.930
saw the news I was like holy cow Chris

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:03.360
Cornell man that's that's nuts but when

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:06.000
I saw the news I was like oh my god

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.420
we made a Temple of the dog reference on

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.610
Mondays n LSS and then there he is in

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.079
the news this happened to us on other

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.130
occasions before you know we mentioned

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:17.010
David Bowie

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:18.620
three days later David Bowie passed away

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.110
and I mean obvi

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.050
steamed sale obviously all these

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.610
situations you know they have other

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.650
mitigating concerns going on with them

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.410
but I am a little bit worried of maybe

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:33.850
Nick Josh and I and everybody else to

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:36.260
contribute to the show might be

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.210
otherworldly gods who can condemn

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:42.260
someone to death just by mentioning them

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:44.720
on our stupid little stream that's got

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:48.920
to be our second secret room right I'm

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:52.220
not saying we are what I am saying is

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:56.350
don't cross us cuz you don't even know

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:58.610
man what we're capable of apparently

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:02.120
okay we're going we're gonna explore

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:04.430
everything we got like eight minutes or

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.710
so well we got seven minutes or so get

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.870
this handled admittedly blank card on

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.210
soos is not the perfect combination it's

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:15.830
like having one son card per floor minus

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:19.220
the full health aspect however one map

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:23.600
per floor certainly not bad either might

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:26.120
be better to have liked it here upon

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.650
obviously but strength once every four

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.089
rooms we get a strength card really

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.230
useful for deals with the devil apart

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.910
from that like who are we trying to

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.589
impress we're killing enemies so fast

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.660
we're never going to need a strength

00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:38.080
card for the stat bonus so things that

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.580
provide us with utility seem way more

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.060
beneficial right now we can do

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:46.100
everything on this floor assuming the

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:50.480
time holds up we can do everything you

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:53.030
just go hard on this admittedly blank

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:56.300
card strength into boss rush would have

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:58.580
been nice so now you got poor babylon

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:02.290
active stamps are looking lovely enough

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.790
money to go get something from the shop

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:07.069
don't really want to take that yet this

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.110
is why you know if we got a Guppies paw

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:11.300
on this floor and deal with the devil

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:14.170
that would be like the perfect scenario

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.170
for us right now

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.589
go full-on spirit arts never have to

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.189
worry about the the Whore of Babylon

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:24.230
being active permanent Polaroid

00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:26.510
invincibility it's a good start we could

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:29.150
use defensive items and spirit oh it's

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.800
probably worth the bomb we could use

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:34.100
like a relic or something like that but

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.510
it's it's a great situation for us to be

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.270
in right now we're about on par with

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:43.460
where we normally are at this point on a

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:44.660
daily point wise which is a little bit

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.210
of a disappointment cuz we should be

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:51.230
ahead of it but I did take especially on

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:54.470
the caves one I played a little roughly

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.790
I was going to say is there is there an

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.870
enemy dropping at some point on this

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:05.270
level or are we just going to walk

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:08.030
around for a hundred years yeah we're

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:11.270
not going to take that on purpose at

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.650
least oh there goes for a babylon we are

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.790
going to go down here and explore the

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:17.450
remainder of what we got going on you

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:19.130
know what you got to check at this point

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:22.040
in your life with two bombs

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.710
you've got to check you throw this I

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.250
know we have magic mush all ready but

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:31.990
you got to give it a shot two trinkets

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.990
none of them very useful at this point

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.550
try to think I mean there was Scott

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:39.200
stamp sound like we've started talking

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.750
about Scott's there you got a check

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.350
three cents blank card Emperor I mean it

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:48.470
is better than blank card on Zeus but I

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:54.950
almost feel like blank card on soos is

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:57.200
like actually better because I'll know

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.520
the proper way assuming did we get black

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.960
candle on this run then I can't remember

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.550
now let's just check these first before

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.830
I worry about it okay Paul this feels

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.870
great I found pills who cares and full

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:10.690
health all right we're good to go here

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:13.100
basically but uh I think I'd rather

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:16.059
assuming we don't have like curse will

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:19.880
be unknown I think I would rather know

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:21.410
where I'm going then just immediately go

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.210
to the boss fight and have to backtrack

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:26.870
and fill in the blanks from there would

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.220
be nice to get to the the secret

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.750
rooms as quickly as possible or not

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.580
secretory sorry the devil room chants as

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.800
quickly as possible I suppose so when

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:40.010
you take damage you have a chance to

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:42.470
spawn nicely done when you take damage

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:44.840
you've got a chance to spawn a golden

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:47.570
poop or sorry a rainbow poop that must

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.059
be the that must be the way bozo works

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:52.040
there in which case potentially it's got

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:54.260
something going for it you got to check

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.850
this we got tons of time I think it's

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.430
worth it just to lower the amount of HP

00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:01.070
that we have and get a black card money

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.150
equals power beautiful item pencils

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.440
pretty good too but I don't know if it's

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.440
energized with either of our tier

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.260
effects so you take money equals power

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:11.690
and then the last thing that we need to

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:15.910
make this run like impossible to lose

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:21.280
and I hesitate with that verbiage but is

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:21.280
well I mean 77 cents wouldn't say no to

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:28.520
however if I can get a card that is

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.980
useful once every few rooms and makes me

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.770
forget about on Zeus here think on Zeus

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:37.010
is fine for our purposes but it could

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.090
get better we talked about Fred Durst a

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.830
lot on the show and then he started

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:43.429
streaming on Twitch I think it's got to

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:46.130
be like within a certain amount of time

00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:47.059
that makes it seem not as artificial

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.230
because like I don't know we were

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:49.550
talking about Fred there's for like six

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.500
months and then he started streaming on

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.360
Twitch tech that's liable to be

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.040
coincidental as our like every single

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.370
one of the things I've drawn up so far

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.370
but still

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.390
I'm just saying man we might be gods

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.960
everybody wants to rule the world that's

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.960
what I've always said

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.340
well let's not I was going to go a

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.770
little deeper into that bit and you know

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.280
sometimes a comedy not that this is what

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:23.600
this is except for a comedy of errors

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.170
but you know people have this opinion

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:30.710
like there's no sacred cows you know if

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:32.360
you get offended by something anything

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.520
that's your fault

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.670
there's no sacred cows I think is kind

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:41.840
of like sacred cows like it's lazy you

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:43.460
know da ela edgy comedy to be you know I

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.230
always find anything I said this last

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.450
time we're not last time but you know I

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.430
saw some David Bowie died as well people

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.470
always go like oh you were a fan of

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:54.080
Chris Cornell why didn't you talk about

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:59.870
it every waking second before he died

00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:01.250
you're just a bandwagon fan but I don't

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.500
even know I'm going with this all I'm

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.150
saying is r.i.p r.i.p especially for

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.060
people like just a little bit older than

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:11.450
me that's that it's hard cuz I was like

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.430
you know six when Soundgarden was at the

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:19.280
the height of their popularity and

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:21.380
influence that'll be like you know if

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.810
I'm alive when Kanye West dies that's

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.060
where it'll be like for me but he might

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:33.110
outlive me by like you know 50 years who

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:36.110
knows how's his diet I don't know that's

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.850
the thing before anybody wanted K West

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.340
beats he and his girls split the buffet

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.960
at KFC that might indicate that at a

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.480
time in his life he had a diet that was

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:47.330
high in perhaps you know saturated fats

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.340
maybe even trans fats but I would never

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.590
you know deign to suggests that he still

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.830
eats like that today I don't know what

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:57.200
his exercise is like but you know gotta

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.930
be in pretty good shape to be putting on

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:05.060
tours all the time you know he's walking

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:07.980
around on a stage I'm calling it 2061

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:11.280
Kanye West

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:14.070
we'll live to be nearly 90 years old

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:18.180
that seems a little you know it does

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:19.980
seem ambitious but what can I say the

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.500
tea leaves have spoken why am I on this

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.930
tangent anyway how did I get into this

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.050
tangent boy this is a bloody big tangent

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:31.590
isn't it point wise how we doing right

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:35.970
now actually like could not be further

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:38.910
from concerned boss rush was fast boss

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:43.680
rush on day leaves is rarely fast so we

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:46.050
should thank the good tyrone above then

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.390
we were able to get like the sickest

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:53.100
damage daily ever okay so it's going to

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:54.390
be one of those huh last thing you got

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.370
to do is give me guppy on this floor

00:23:54.390 --> 00:24:03.830
they were good to go but he's so goofy

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:09.050
he's a cat but he dies dies dies on

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:15.240
cathedrals at YouTube if there's nothing

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:18.900
missing in my run then when do I die on

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.670
the caves one lucky britney spears

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:24.800
anybody you heard of this girl I think

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.800
she's really a big up-and-coming artist

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:33.990
no tinted rocks so what I have to know

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.120
because that's the second time I've been

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:41.010
hit by something that I don't

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:45.630
necessarily think existed this bozo just

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:48.740
calls you to take damage sometimes or

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:51.030
did I just miss what what hit me there

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:54.270
obviously the amnesia pill here is kind

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:56.730
of unfortunate directly hard counters

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:59.700
blank card on suits but I don't really

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:01.170
think we'd be kicking too much more but

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.340
if we had Guppies paw right now or

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.980
Guppies head right now I mean we're

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.240
crushing it regardless sack of sack soon

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.900
what do you get for the run that has

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:12.620
everything ask him for a friend that was

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.620
a terrible Dodge

00:25:13.259 --> 00:25:19.899
keep in mind even as our HP gets a

00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:25.479
little lower due to personal mistakes

00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:26.249
here we are still oh there's a card in

00:25:25.479 --> 00:25:29.139
there

00:25:26.249 --> 00:25:31.659
Emperor ace of diamonds no I mean

00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:32.529
there's a card in here we still have

00:25:31.659 --> 00:25:39.099
nine lives

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:40.629
Emperor chariot sorry not Emperor blank

00:25:39.099 --> 00:25:43.899
card Islands whose blank card end for a

00:25:40.629 --> 00:25:45.909
blank card sherry I mean once every four

00:25:43.899 --> 00:25:48.009
rooms blank card sherry it or we could

00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:49.659
stick with on suits but we've used it to

00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:53.079
tell us where to go for one floor so

00:25:49.659 --> 00:26:00.819
sure blank card blank card sherry of

00:25:53.079 --> 00:26:05.909
dude why not not going to be great on

00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:08.799
hush specifically but I was really

00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:10.929
banking on that devil deal there we've

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:12.309
got 30 cents don't I mean we have a good

00:26:10.929 --> 00:26:13.869
damage regardless but you don't need to

00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:16.989
spend unless you see something you

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:18.819
really like or something that could amp

00:26:16.989 --> 00:26:24.489
up your point total so I mean Book of

00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:25.869
Secrets is pretty great it's better than

00:26:24.489 --> 00:26:29.469
blank card chariot

00:26:25.869 --> 00:26:35.049
oh dude but they're both so good don't

00:26:29.469 --> 00:26:40.029
make me choose you got to look Hank man

00:26:35.049 --> 00:26:42.489
not really worth it box of friends

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:46.329
actually could be the right choice

00:26:42.489 --> 00:26:48.309
hilariously enough I think you go

00:26:46.329 --> 00:26:51.819
infestation too because we don't need

00:26:48.309 --> 00:26:55.329
black hearts that much once every four

00:26:51.819 --> 00:27:00.309
rooms box of friends and then we take

00:26:55.329 --> 00:27:02.079
whatever the passive was from the from

00:27:00.309 --> 00:27:04.089
the other room we're not going to do

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:08.739
void it's always better to go to the lam

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:13.629
floor so take this Y box of friends by

00:27:08.739 --> 00:27:16.209
the way well oh three pills two tiers

00:27:13.629 --> 00:27:18.309
downgrades and uh telefilms which has

00:27:16.209 --> 00:27:21.320
taken me into the hush - I lost my

00:27:18.309 --> 00:27:25.700
chariot card not a huge deal

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:29.050
so the thinking is like double-double

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.050
sake bus is going to do some great work

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:34.660
double delirium I don't know maybe

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.720
even double sack of sacks can do some

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.850
great stuff for us I don't know if this

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.040
is the right call but it is like one of

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:49.990
the very very that was so bad

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:52.120
rare opportunities to productively take

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.010
box of friends outside of a Lilith's

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:58.750
start so as far as I'm concerned that's

00:27:54.010 --> 00:28:00.580
like not a common occurrence so I'm

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.960
going to take it because not only does

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.990
it have a little it's kind of a hint of

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.180
Zayn if I'm being real with you but on

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:09.330
top of that hint of Zayn it's actually

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:12.670
got like it's got some real meat to it

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:15.160
double high damage BFF succubus plus

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:17.170
then you got you know I mean double BFF

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:22.720
everything double BFF manga baby ghost

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:24.280
baby rainbow baby I don't think they're

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.580
going to be doing too much but it's like

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:31.000
you know in spider-man one who killed

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:32.710
the Green Goblin is spider-man right but

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.960
in the scene where he's dangling Mary

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.750
Jane over the you know Williamsburg

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.679
Bridge or whatever it's probably just

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:43.840
the Brooklyn Bridge huh he's about to

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:46.870
kill spider-man and then the citizens of

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.320
New York throw soda cans into his face

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:52.059
and Green Goblin goes ah and then the

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.000
one guy goes you'll mess with spider-man

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:56.920
you'll mess with us and then that's what

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.610
these familiars are essentially doing

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.080
for me right now

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.750
there'd be in my little soda can

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.120
throwers they're saying hey you mess

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.520
with Maggie you mess with the NL on

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.970
today's daily you mess with us so we

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:13.840
took a lot of hits there but we are like

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:15.670
it's unfathomable if we died on this run

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:20.650
without accidentally like re-rolling our

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:23.320
whole run I think I might be getting

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.850
spider-man and spider-man two mixed up

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.330
spider-man 2 is the one where he's on

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:31.380
the subway and then the city of New York

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.380
rallies behind him

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.929
and they carry him off the train like

00:29:35.139 --> 00:29:39.759
you've Jesus Christ but there's

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:43.720
definitely they throw some soda cans in

00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:45.549
the first movie I remember it's

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.659
definitely many might not be soda cans

00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:49.629
but they're throwing something at the

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:54.340
Green Goblin I promise you this alright

00:29:49.629 --> 00:29:55.899
so I'm not really worried about beating

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.759
some victims score today because let me

00:29:55.899 --> 00:29:59.529
tell you something about sin victim he

00:29:57.759 --> 00:30:02.499
only brags about his daily scores when

00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:05.259
they're good I'll brag about a crack

00:30:02.499 --> 00:30:08.710
daily score and all these dailies end up

00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:11.529
on the leaderboards right this guy's

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.149
doing some statistics 101 stuff on he's

00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:15.009
pulling only his best scores and then

00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:16.690
choosing to call me out over it you know

00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:18.879
the rankings speak for themselves

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:21.129
I don't be mad at Mesa victim you know

00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:23.200
that be mad at greed but for telling the

00:30:21.129 --> 00:30:26.279
truth but I am worried about getting the

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.539
best score possible here without

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:31.269
succumbing to the minutia of trying to

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:33.789
figure out exactly how to min/max

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:38.289
everything 100% at expensive

00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:46.059
entertainment on our end at least so I

00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:47.710
think that that's fine I'm just going to

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:50.590
try to minimize the damage penalty

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:56.320
that's static 100% of the time you want

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:58.239
to do that and apart from that never

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.090
spend anything keep opening these and

00:30:58.239 --> 00:31:02.909
hoping for two of you know in hindsight

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.960
I didn't think of this until just now

00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:08.369
maybe we should have stuck with blank

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:13.149
card from a strictly daily perspective

00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:14.649
blank card makes a lot of sense I I

00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:18.609
thought I popped the chariot what did I

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:21.580
pop instead of the chariot there from a

00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:23.259
strictly like daily perspective yeah I

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.999
left the chariot behind no I left the

00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:28.419
cherry behind for High Priestess I see

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:30.099
that was stupid from the strictly daily

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:32.470
perspective doubling consumables at this

00:31:30.099 --> 00:31:34.090
point would give us more points so that

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.320
would be wise but we've already you know

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.619
we've made our bed now it's time to lie

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.619
in it

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:47.020
northern lie in it get it that's the

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:49.400
name of the YouTube channel

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.410
alright we should grab this you never

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:55.370
know if I lose to him by 15 points I'll

00:31:51.410 --> 00:32:04.070
be displeased 50,000 is probably out of

00:31:55.370 --> 00:32:07.430
reach for us at this point that's my

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:09.080
guess anyway what's our luck stat ad 3

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:14.560
so we should get some consumables on the

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:18.290
next floor maybe not too many good job

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.850
still looking for two of you've had a

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.410
subs which maybe we could have used

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:25.730
creatively to make something happen but

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:28.100
that train is sailed okay well that's

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.890
one way to get into a secret room I

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:34.490
think we have double on Zeus yes alright

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:36.590
let's go fifty-thousand seems out of

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:38.570
reach I'm thinking mid-40s probably good

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:40.130
enough to for top 250 but there's so

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:47.180
many scores that are going to be ranked

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:50.210
well today without a doubt wait where is

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:52.430
my second of every orbital right now

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.200
every familiar why do I only have one of

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.970
it I used it though is the thing where's

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.300
my second are they all doubled on top of

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.300
each other

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:05.000
alright Magus Satan gives us a bonus as

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:07.070
well so and we did become guppy you knew

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.020
it had to happen search your feelings

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:14.060
search your heart search your soul if

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:15.440
you find me let you search no more we

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.930
don't want to fight mega Satan yet so

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:21.260
now I would advise or revise I should

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:24.320
say my previous estimate all secret

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:29.300
rooms no damage kill mega Satan I think

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:32.390
we could be looking at like a maybe a

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:35.030
low I'm gonna say 48 I think if we

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:38.620
really play to our strengths here we

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.620
could be looking at a 48 thousand daily

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:45.940
still not enough for like a top class

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.940
placement necessarily but

00:33:46.309 --> 00:33:55.799
not a bad score and this is a nice daily

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.960
you know I've been throwing shaded

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:59.220
Sandvik to actually have to thank him

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:03.030
you shouldn't be taking itis at this

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:06.120
point but we can take that one I have to

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:07.799
thank him because him telling me like to

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.840
do today's daily put me in a good state

00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:13.200
of mind for it I said to myself well

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.970
this it's this more I could do well on

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.649
the daily of course I got to do it no I

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:19.260
didn't say that that would be incredibly

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:20.369
disrespectful I thought it no of course

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.200
I didn't think that I just thought you

00:34:20.369 --> 00:34:24.419
know what it's nice to be advised of a

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.129
good daily so I go in you know with a

00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:30.389
smile on my face instead of a chip on my

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:38.369
shoulder and here we are having a good

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:44.940
daily but you can't is the thing maybe

00:34:38.369 --> 00:34:47.159
you can what if you kill do you get the

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:50.280
bonus for killing mega satan or you get

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:52.679
the bonus for touching mega satan's

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.500
trophy because if you get it for killing

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:58.910
mega satan we should do everything kill

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:01.170
mega satan use the forget-me-now and

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:04.830
then do the whole floor again but this

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:09.990
time fighting the lamb you don't be

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:11.340
great is that we got dad's key I took

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:15.330
tech point five as well because it's

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:16.920
awesome but if you get it for touching

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.900
the trophy we definitely should not

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.930
forget me now because it'll cost us like

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:24.840
ten thousand points so it's a it's a

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:26.520
conservative this leprosy you're tearing

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.760
me apart okay it's a Tommy Wiseau

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.200
reference then shard of glass once it

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.250
was an adamant I didn't know what it

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:39.540
could do it's called shot a glass I've

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:41.550
watched the para do fresher it's called

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:45.270
it's called Charlie glass a fresh about

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:48.150
can do there we go it's a vine meme it's

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.800
a ghost mean oh what the heck give me

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.650
some more spiders so you may have

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.109
survived by this point I'm not going to

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:58.369
use forget me now I will accept that it

00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:58.369
might be the right play

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:05.460
but I think I've actually done it before

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.710
and my gut is telling me that that's not

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:11.099
the right play to be honest with you we

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:13.200
could pretty much beat the entire next

00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:14.520
floor and mega Satan had like roughly

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.210
the same speed it's not like this is

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.930
going to be a long Daly either way so if

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.920
not I'm not motivated by like time

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.890
self-interest like oh I got to go get

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:28.560
lunch or something like that I hate like

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:31.319
a 1100 calorie lunch I'm probably pretty

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.079
good for a while here but I actually

00:36:31.319 --> 00:36:35.520
think that the right thing to do is to

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:39.960
do what we're doing right now we'll find

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.430
out if that's the case so I called 48

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.579
thousand that might be a little bit

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.780
generous but we'll see here soon we're

00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:47.520
not going to be in the 50s so we're not

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.589
going to be on the front page but that's

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.480
fair given the damage penalty we took

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:54.780
today and honestly the esteemed

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.849
competition in the eyes of community and

00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:00.170
it's a weekend so that you know it's

00:36:56.849 --> 00:37:03.180
going to be a busy daily to begin with

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.740
46,000 288 I think that's just fine

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.660
civic that you did beat us today

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.920
