##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.240
everybody welcome back easiest run of

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.000
all time on the last run d 100 we never

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.660
had a terrible roll we came close a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.580
couple times

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.170
dude we must have had evens blessing on

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:20.580
last run look at this p6 Cyn 49 brother

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.980
Bobby succubus Necronomicon 2 HP good

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.830
damage great rate of fire great speed

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.170
actually good speed let's let's make

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.269
them work for it a little bit but yeah

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.920
like average damage with an above

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.140
average rate of fire a familiar that's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.730
not going to help out too much but

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:42.120
succubus doing great work to HP gives us

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.910
some resiliency and combine that excuse

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.770
me sir

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.570
with the Necronomicon we got some pretty

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.520
good like killing power right now should

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.440
be in a good spot on today's run should

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.690
be should be you never know we could be

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.489
in a great spot we could be in a spot

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.370
that looks good but gets bad at some

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
point there's many different ways that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.810
this can go now I'm going to spare you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.220
the minutia of going down each and every

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.229
single one of them you know well it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.060
could have a good run that gets bad and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.700
then men wins in the end regardless you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.180
know sure there's infinity waves out

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.340
here let's go at the present moment

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.610
though we got Jackie s to worry about

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.700
Jackie S is my way of saying Jack Jack

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.680
poop I always get this trinket messed up

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.860
is this the one this is stop it means we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.990
don't get any spacebar items we probably

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.220
do not want that Necronomicon is good

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.590
but we'd like to get more space bar

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.740
items if only so we can get bookworm and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
dude Necronomicon for me to just out of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.850
nowhere be like Necronomicon is good

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.350
that's a huge growth in my relationship

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.020
with Necronomicon because previously

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.030
this is kind of like the item i yelled

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.469
at and I was like this item is trash and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.229
I can't believe it's a six room charge

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.210
it is still pretty bad like it's not

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.619
amazing but it's very useful in the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.869
early game especially if you don't want

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.750
to do a big room and like these first

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.360
couple of floors have the worst big

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.600
rooms in terms of you know your level of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.950
skill while you're

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.200
your level of strength I should say

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.060
versus the rooms that they throw at you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.760
you know a bunch of enemies that are

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.650
total jerks many of which are going to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.170
be champions and then they just expect

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.930
you to deal with them one at a time I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.380
say no to that sir I say no we're going

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.810
to use bombs parasitoid tiers is good

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.570
enough common cold might honestly have

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.840
been good enough but parasitoids here is

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.740
a little bit on the better side scales

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.960
with hivemind

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.030
I don't think it gives us Beelzebub

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.020
transformation like that's a perfect

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.550
room use this son

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.140
the only more perfect room would be a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.650
room that basically guarantees us a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.570
battery charge yeah I think that was

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.210
fairly doubtlessly the right choice

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.400
there succubus is doing great work I

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.810
would love to just get ridiculous damage

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.350
from this deal with the devil

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.970
and be in an unstoppable position I'm a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.430
little nervous actually that we're going

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.500
to get hit here nervous is not the right

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.450
word I'm an adult I'm mildly on an

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.060
intellectual but not emotional level

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.530
concerned about the idea that we could

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.340
take damage here and ruin our deal with

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.340
the devil chance let's go

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.140
instead we got a rate of fire increase

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.450
two very valuable hearts and then follow

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:41.270
it up with five red Jessica be good it

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.210
could be good it could be great it's

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.390
already great actually two guppy items

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.290
we didn't quite get the third but

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.910
obviously we're going to go dead cat

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.840
here we also got feels like I'm walking

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.200
on sunshine

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.600
um I mean Guppies head is better let's

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.010
take basically you're smart people I

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.390
would be lying to you at this point if I

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.040
was like oh we're gonna take

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.360
Necronomicon because I think it could be

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.070
better in this unique circumstance

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.810
obviously I would be like deliberately

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.230
nerfing myself Gabi's head is the item

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.530
to take here so we're 2/3 of the way to

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.390
guppy this is like you know unstoppable

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.130
force versus a movable object we haven't

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.609
gotten the guppy transformation recently

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.990
but we've got such good chances to get

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.060
it now deal with the devil precedent

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.100
plus well at least a little bit of

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.540
spirit art action protecting us probably

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.320
won't to have a next floor but could

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.570
happen next floor this is an important

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.400
point I think we can get all the special

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.610
stuff on this floor if this is a secret

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.740
room which it is so go in here obviously

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.979
we're going to do forget-me-now we're

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:52.340
going to lose a take this I really

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.870
needed that to be two of spades I used

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.380
two of clubs anyway save yourself the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.660
black card and here we get a key okay

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:07.910
use a bomb to grab the key

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:11.919
leave walk into the boss Trap room open

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.600
the golden chest and then forget me now

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.360
who okay interesting so now we have no

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.040
spacebar item I would say no spacebar

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.940
item is worse than Guppies head I don't

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.229
know if that's being a little bit

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.210
controversial but we're going to get

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.280
another basically one extra deal with

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.940
the devil chance over the course of the

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.880
entire run don't make me laugh you're

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.270
making me laugh ahahaha with your bad

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.039
arcades and you are making me want to do

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.310
a little bit of a lady Gaga parody Oh

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.310
woo

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:49.810
screw diabetic aid the lyrics were sort

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.160
of you know oh they're you understand

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:57.310
what song I'm referencing which is good

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.870
because the pitch was a little off red

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.980
hearts not what we're interested in

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.040
right now in fact we're interested in

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.480
consumables above all else it is

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.480
unfathomable almost that this run would

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.360
be a loss though like we've got amazing

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.080
stats it's going to say great stats and

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.030
I said no we can bust out the a word

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.550
this is an A+ start here to be on the

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.290
second floor with the kind of you know

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.850
the caliber of items that we've got so

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.950
far is a little ridiculous not to

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.240
mention there's a semi-decent chance

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.310
that we could just become guppy right

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.139
here I'd say there's like a 10% chance

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.500
we can become guppy probably is a little

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.970
bit lower than that because we is a

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.990
one-third chance to get a deal with the

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.250
devil and then what are the odds that

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.410
it's got items and then then it has a

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.720
guppy item amongst them so is it a third

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.229
over a third which would be like roughly

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.090
nine percent it's probably worse odds

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.979
than that but we've got many chances to

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.350
make it happen

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:55.060
blank room save this for a possible per

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.650
throw I think blank route is perthro

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.800
unless you're on a daily and what you

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.450
wanted to be a was and by is I mean like

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.280
we were saving it for the chance to make

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.720
that happen

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:09.010
mild tears upgrade you're not wrong if

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.690
you're saying like why don't you go back

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.169
and sleep in the bed by the way you're

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.690
not wrong but I also don't think you're

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:18.010
necessarily particularly right not to be

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.039
rude to you I mean you're at your own

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:25.000
sovereign adult you know you can tell me

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:26.229
the f off if you want to but it's not

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.820
going to give us anything to sleep in

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:29.830
the bed unless you manage to give up our

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.350
red heart somehow in which case it'll

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.150
give us three spirit hearts and we

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:38.680
basically justified getting a deal with

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.330
the devil by itself but doesn't seem

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.820
likely that that's going to happen we

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.160
also have like no interest whatsoever in

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.169
our shop at least with our current level

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.490
of finances but it wasn't a bad idea to

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.490
come down here I think

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.680
come out of this with a little bit more

00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:00.550
HP we got all of our consumables back

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.820
we got a I mean uninteresting but all

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.620
together mostly useless space bar item

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.210
but at least did something you know

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.310
we're back in the saddle again in that

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.030
department this I mean it could be a

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:17.230
secret room but I'm a little skeptical

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:21.670
it was a secret room and that was a

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:24.940
waste of my time I don't have like free

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.590
internet my bandwidth limited that's not

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.600
really true we're on an unlimited plan I

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.610
think or at least I've never I've never

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:35.979
noticed myself being throttled which is

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:38.560
nice you know I don't really know where

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:40.360
to go from that except that sometimes

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.080
people go you know the old Canadian

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.790
Internet you got data plans right I

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.290
don't know and I think that's the ideal

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.390
circumstance I mean I should know

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.190
because it's directly relating to my job

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.750
but I'm kind of like ignorant of it

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.420
until it causes me problems you know

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.220
it's like the highway on the way to my

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.570
office just works totally fine so I

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.280
don't know the intricacies of you know

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:05.230
the grade of concrete that was used to

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.120
make it I don't know why I felt the

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.589
compulsion to use a feels like I'm

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.520
walking on sunshine pill that seems like

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:15.520
kind of a bad play but it's all right I

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.810
play this once so we can really afford

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.060
to do I would like to make boss rush

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.230
happen we're strong enough to make it we

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.150
haven't done it that much recently

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.530
although probably like roughly in

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.820
keeping with average we haven't done it

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:31.450
enough to be like I don't want to do

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:34.960
boss rush ever again oh yeah okay 15

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.730
cents right okay you just got roof we

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.800
got steam sale anyway so I'm happy but

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.110
I'm like I'm an idiot because we could

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.370
have just gotten a trinket smelter and

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.490
trinket smelter would have been way more

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:48.190
fun than just rolling magic fingers

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.570
which the only time I feel happy rolling

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:53.470
magic fingers is when I have like

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:58.910
literally 99 cents and a bunch of damage

00:09:53.470 --> 00:10:01.860
so check this we got a look

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.330
double paralysis pill you know it's not

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.160
that much worse than just getting one

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.620
paralysis pill if you want to get

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:12.540
technical and I do want to get technical

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:15.240
baby it's always my introduction to

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:18.750
dirty talk hmm where our local static

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.070
variable stored in the local static data

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.070
area that's correct

00:10:22.339 --> 00:10:27.360
please I don't want are you a wizard

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.220
right now we got a homing tear so don't

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:34.470
sweat it that much you're still crushing

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:37.290
it here we actually don't really need

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.940
anything on this run at least urgently

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:44.580
usually at this point in the run you

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:47.250
need something but right now all of our

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.960
stats are good some of our stat while

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.029
our HP could use some work I suppose but

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.010
some of our stats are great like our

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:57.810
rate of fire is genuinely awesome right

00:10:53.010 --> 00:11:00.839
now and our damage might not be 10 out

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:05.970
of 10 in fact it's about 3.5 out of

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:07.980
infinity however we're firing roughly

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:11.550
twice as often as we would at this point

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.529
on the run on an average run at least

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.970
and our shots are homing so we get more

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:17.100
efficiency out of them as well so we can

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.800
we can coast on this level of damage for

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.320
a little bit longer even if I would

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.350
prefer not to dark bomb basically is

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.800
just at this point looking at complain

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:31.260
about we've given us amazing offensive

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.790
items and now one of the best defensive

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.339
items in the game is almost guarantees

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.959
us a win provided we find like any red

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:40.589
hearts which hilariously we didn't on

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:42.360
this floor but we over it I actually

00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:43.500
said incorrectly on the last where we

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.870
have deal with the devil precedent we

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.870
don't we have deal with a double chance

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:54.750
Jesus juice I always get confused with

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:58.589
is that a reference to Michael Jackson

00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:02.550
or is it a reference to communion

00:11:58.589 --> 00:12:06.860
communion wine I've got to be honest you

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:10.580
know I grew up in a family that is not

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:16.230
religious but sort of like

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:18.600
like my grandparents were non-practicing

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:21.810
but like sort of really they were like

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.790
well you got to get baptized but we

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:27.510
don't really go to church so I have them

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:29.220
baptized but I've never I've never been

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.360
confirmed which is the step that allows

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.230
you to take communion

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:37.820
I've also like straight up only been in

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:43.230
church outside of a wedding or a funeral

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:46.410
or like a concert or a pancake breakfast

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:50.160
like maybe three times I think I've only

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:52.350
been present at like a communion

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.210
ceremony once so I'm a little ignorant

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.520
of what goes on there that's not like

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.500
you know I'm not bringing this into like

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.660
a religious kind of conversation that

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:04.230
we're having here I'm just I'm giving

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:06.120
you some insight into thank you dark mom

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.640
I'm giving you some insight into you

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.900
know when I talk about Christianity or

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.650
Catholicism I basically know nothing

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.650
about it

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:22.850
but I never got confirmed which I think

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:25.230
means I am doomed it's like I got my

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.510
religious learning permit but then I

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:33.360
just let it expire I'll get my license

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:36.690
next year and just never went through

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:40.350
with it I've been president like like

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:44.190
five or six baptisms and you could not

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.810
make and again this is so meant to be

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.330
inoffensive that if you're offended by

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.770
it I'm almost mad at you like I'm I'm

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.230
not one of those people who's like I

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:55.200
made enough color joke you got offended

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:57.810
yo sorry snowflake that's that's very

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.880
much not my brand however if you get

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:02.490
offended by this I mean I'm sorry but

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.590
mostly I'm sorry for what you've chosen

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.080
to take offense to here because this is

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:11.100
going to be ridiculous I don't know if

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:14.150
there is some more self serving ceremony

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.860
than a baptism of like a young child

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:19.740
it's like all these adults get together

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.970
they take their Saturday they go what

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.190
are you gonna do this Saturday I was

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.880
thinking I would you know take one of

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.460
the two days

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.970
per week that I get off from a job I

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.710
don't really like and go watch an infant

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:35.310
get some water rubbed on its forehead

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:38.730
because it's the eighth son of an

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:43.620
estranged you know older brother of mine

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:46.740
yo this is life is good so we get

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:54.470
doubled everything here and then we get

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:58.020
to take a second something as well in so

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.890
mm man it was a year of it that wouldn't

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.920
have done anything anyway

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:03.870
thank better plans going I'm going I

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.730
mean the soul is fine for a doubling but

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:09.360
dude why not take sensor and get two

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:11.310
sensors the soul would be basically just

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.720
be expecting extra spirit hearts and

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.930
that's not it says by the way that the

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.600
baptism ceremony first up I just don't

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:22.710
like words that end in ISM as an adult

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:28.220
it makes me uncomfortable but because of

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:30.660
jism but it's like I went and saw my

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.080
three-year-olds this is like 15 years

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.740
ago

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:38.940
my three-year-old cousin get baptized my

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:42.990
uncle lives in Nova Scotia and I lived

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.700
in Ontario so it was like a three-day

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.760
drive or something like that for them to

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.830
get down here and I've seen them I like

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.330
my uncle and his family I think we're

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.460
kindred spirits but we don't see each

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.310
other very often like once every 6 or 7

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:59.040
years I took a Saturday at like 10:00

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.990
a.m. to watch my three-year-old cousin

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.990
get baptized there's a cousin's cup no

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:07.710
idea was going on you know hey do you

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.760
want to burn forever and hellfire no all

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.000
right well we're going to do this

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:15.390
ceremony then I'm not mad that it gets

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.650
done you know to children's I think you

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:19.380
know in the end it's just you know a

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.390
ceremony that you know for me is

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.910
harmless and for them if they feel like

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:27.450
that's important so be it right it's

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:31.530
more like you should be able to say no

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:34.260
to to a baptism I think you know I've

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:37.660
never been to a Bar Mitzvah but I kind

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:41.200
of think that a Bar Mitzvah is like a

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.550
a maturation into adulthood for a young

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.530
man you know they've got

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.230
responsibilities they prepared for the

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:50.260
event it's got a lot of symbolism and

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:54.760
and some autonomy over it as well

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:59.470
oh that's copy we're in the clear

00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.600
let's like as a 14 year old being like I

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.920
just want to play NFL quarterback Club

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.680
but I got to watch my cousin get some

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:08.410
water rubbed on his head with 30 other

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.500
strangers who have never met my my

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:13.540
cousin but you know they pod freaking

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.550
soccer to my uncle when he was 8 years

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.640
old and now they can't say no to be in

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.470
here again I'm not saying it's a stupid

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.530
ceremony I'm just saying it's stupid

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:26.500
that other people are expected to attend

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:28.270
if you want to attend that's fine it's

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.300
not like every weekend I'm like well

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:36.100
another baptism invitation it hurts

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:38.230
being so popular for some reason no it's

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.020
just is that there's a few things like

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.610
that like I would much rather help my

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:47.890
friend move and go to their child's

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:51.370
baptism but I'd much rather go to their

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.920
baptism than their bris no question

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.210
about that

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.950
at least when you help a friend move by

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.300
the way in order to for you to fully

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.610
appreciate what I said that I'd rather

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:04.720
help a friend move then go to their

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:06.880
child's baptism I hate moving I just I

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.550
do not like it one bit

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.670
no I mean nobody does but I moved so

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.260
much as well.they I moved a few times as

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.060
a child which I know if you're in like a

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.490
you know military family or for whatever

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.500
reason you just moved a lot haha you're

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:23.740
like a little baby right but at the same

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:26.080
time you know when you're an adult and

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.630
you move I feel like it's not fair

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.280
because if you're doing like some flip

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.520
this house sort of stuff you might have

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.000
made like a tidy sum you're like I hate

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.650
moving

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.330
you're your kid is like I hate moving

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.330
and then you're like yeah me too but we

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.890
are making you know a hundred thousand

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.380
dollars by selling this house and then

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.730
buying a different one so you know put

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.850
up or shut up kid you know somebody's

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:51.200
got to put dinner on the table but as a

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:53.330
kid moving is always like a loser Lou

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.830
right like you you're going to have to

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.990
make new friends if you're moving to a

00:18:54.830 --> 00:19:01.880
new area if you're not going to the same

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:03.620
school we have steam sale so we should

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:09.169
end golden bomb so we should really go

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:10.760
for this but as an adult you've got a

00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:12.919
little bit more leverage but at least

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.070
when you help a friend move it's

00:19:12.919 --> 00:19:18.830
productive like you're you're helping

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.409
them do something that they need your

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.850
help with especially if you own a truck

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:24.110
which I do not because I don't want to

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.559
get asked to help people move all the

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.980
time

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:30.820
I like my weekends I got a stream on

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.820
those weekends man

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:37.159
I'm not saying a baptism is inherently

00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:38.600
unproductive you know from a cosmic

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:40.070
sense if that's what you believe I'm

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.750
just saying you know for me I'm like

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:44.350
there's kanae can we just like get

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:48.230
together and I'll like uh mow your lawn

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:50.120
to get out of this baptism thing this is

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:54.740
by the way a completely manufactured

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:56.149
scenario I don't have any friends who

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.070
have ever invited me to their child's

00:19:56.149 --> 00:20:01.880
baptism I don't have any friends

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.269
boom-boom-boom

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.950
so I mean we're going to use even sold

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:08.389
right even Sol Plus chaos means you

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:14.779
probably should not have waited to use

00:20:08.389 --> 00:20:17.929
it in this room we do have 10 lives so

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:21.679
we could use Plan C but I'm not going to

00:20:17.929 --> 00:20:24.230
because our because I resent it dude the

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:25.909
Telefilms curse has gotten us there's no

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.880
conspiracy that's like I don't want to

00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:30.440
fight mega Satan I like fighting mega

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.809
satan especially when our run is strong

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:40.159
as it is right now anyway what a bizarre

00:20:35.809 --> 00:20:42.289
tirade to be rambling about this you

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:46.340
know baptism nonsense forever it's

00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:48.830
irrelevant the point is you can believe

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.269
whatever you want to believe but your

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.309
beliefs start to be called into question

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:54.200
when you ask me to take time off of my

00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:57.289
valuable Saturday to watch your

00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:00.500
religious ceremony ok wedding little

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:02.120
different so you know symbolic you need

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.070
to to people too but if you're like hey

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.200
come watch my child be like

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:08.030
take the first step in and not going to

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.690
hell I'm like you know what I wish you

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:13.490
the best

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:19.640
I got a nice long date with the my own

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:23.780
religion it's called sleeping in ISM but

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:26.180
by all means I'm a devout follower of

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.460
sleeping in ISM I practice it as often

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.910
as possible multiple times per week for

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.200
certain and I'm very lucky to be able to

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.250
do so and you know what I think it's

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:40.010
enriched my life in a lot of ways

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:42.520
let's move downwards here oh they're

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:44.720
gonna let me thank you

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.450
do I could use a speedo Graham just

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.710
throw this out you can use a speed

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.110
upgrade I'm just throwing this out here

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.520
is 0.8 to be with Taurus and it's kind

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:56.780
of I mean we're getting faster

00:21:52.520 --> 00:22:00.410
eventually but sort of slowly

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:03.830
unfortunately what is this in the new

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:07.850
tests to do so we're definitely we can

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:11.480
already fly it's not bad I should point

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:17.390
that out like fate is not bad here it's

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:19.550
just not any good the only thing you can

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.500
do is give us more HP and at this point

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:25.550
I would say that that's a dubious pick

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:28.880
up we might not want it we might want it

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:33.410
but we might not want it you know so if

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.730
we if we don't know which way the the

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:40.190
wind is going to blow on that one I say

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:41.570
we just stay away from it you might

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:45.260
think that I'm very selfish with my time

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:47.240
ins I mean sort of the case to be honest

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.190
with you and then like this is pulling

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.670
back the veil I am a little selfish with

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:54.350
my time because I'd like to record

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.590
videos and also that's like my

00:22:54.350 --> 00:23:01.430
responsibility not just everyone's

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:04.220
always like you know oh you should okay

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:07.250
it says 2:00 a.m. on a Saturday and

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.960
you're playing battlegrounds why don't

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.300
you just stream it this is the kind of

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.800
economy we're in here like that in terms

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.940
of our time at least where it's like

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.490
love you're playing something you might

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:20.750
as well be live but I'm

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:24.110
I'm not ungenerous when the cause is

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:28.010
right like last year and I said I

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:29.390
recognized the irony and taken a cherry

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:35.360
picking of situation from literally a

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:37.070
year ago but last year for Kiera is like

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.960
either Mother's Day or like one of

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.610
Kate's parents birthdays we took them

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.580
out to dinner and her dad was like hey I

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:47.780
got this like charity walkathon thing

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:49.730
going on tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. it was a

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:53.450
Saturday like you guys want to do it and

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:57.080
of course like like no it's like

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:59.450
mentally like are you of course not you

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.250
crazy you know we don't want to take our

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.500
Saturday to a charity walkathon we just

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:06.080
found out about you know two minutes ago

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:09.020
but I said you know what it like it'll

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.120
be a good time too we can bond and you

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.640
know I can tell it's important to you so

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.890
we'll do it and we we went out like 9:00

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.290
a.m. it's not super early but early on a

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:23.060
Saturday the hot Summer Sun and we

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:26.270
walked the charity walk for polio and it

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:30.380
was a good time and by a good time I

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:32.120
mean it was for a good cause so I don't

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.610
have a problem you know the that I can

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.710
easily justify as quality time my wife

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.390
and her family brings us a little closer

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.570
together you know raises money for

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.520
charity I wanted to be very extremely

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.070
northern lyonie I could point out that I

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.570
made a donation to the charitable

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.760
organization that was doing the event

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.940
and my thank you for that was getting

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.580
non-stop calls like every morning at

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.290
9:00 a.m. trying to solicit some more

00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.860
personal information so they it's like

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:03.680
knowledge you don't understand I know

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.660
the this is going to sound insulting but

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.100
the average age in this organization is

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:12.140
like at least 50 years old I understand

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.940
you don't get that many Millennials

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.300
necessarily we don't like to talk on the

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:20.150
phone the money has changed hands do

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:24.920
with it what you wants just never call

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:27.740
me again or I'll you know crowdsource

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.260
someone to bust your kneecaps obviously

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:34.540
that's not true but

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:36.310
I like talking on the phone okay I saw a

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.790
tweet the other day the height of comedy

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:41.140
a tweet where the basic gist of it and

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.460
I'm going to not source it because I

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.190
forgot who made it and people always

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.710
have like you know fake Twitter names

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.180
like you know the thought police

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.460
but it's instead of thought it's like

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:56.130
you know that hole over there but anyway

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:58.570
the point is I know I can't have Skype

00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.730
message right now it said like the

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.230
stages of friendship is like Stage four

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.900
we hang out

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.420
Stage three we can travel together Stage

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.220
two like I invite you to my wedding

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.690
and stage one I'll talk to you on the

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.160
telephone I think actually Stage two is

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.900
like I would literally give my life for

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.500
you and stage one is I will talk to you

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.880
on the telephone it's pretty much I can

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.950
relate to that is what I'll say the

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:25.090
telephone is it's an anxiety inducing

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:27.490
piece of equipment which is why I again

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:29.290
this is like I think this is not like oh

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.270
you're so charitable there are so many

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:33.850
streamers that are so charitable and

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:35.500
embrace like so much money for st. Jude

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.450
and other various organizations that I'm

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.940
not trying to say like oh I'm so

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.840
charitable you know but maybe like once

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.870
or twice a year there's like a

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.580
fundraising thing that someone in my

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:47.830
family or extended family does and I'm a

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:51.520
gal contribute to that I think that's

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:53.170
you know when I was a child the extended

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.690
family network contributed to my stupid

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:57.010
you know yeah I'm selling chocolate bars

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.650
how many chocolate bars would you like

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.600
to buy reasonable adult then chocolate

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:03.250
bars that's a normal adult amount of

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.690
chocolate bars to purchase at once

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:10.360
of course so you know I give back now

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:14.160
when I'm in a position to do so and and

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:17.380
this year I gave to an organization no

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.780
correspondence whatsoever sign me up for

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.060

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:28.740
understand as hard as a charity I've got

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.740
a hustle these people get me

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:35.539
I'm going to avoid naming them because I

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:38.480

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.950

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.649
good thing for the world like I'm so

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:57.350
much more likely to contribute to that

00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:59.720
organization in the future as a result

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:02.210

ads you got to rework your brand

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:21.139
nihilism is so in here's here's your new

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.000
ad for laundry detergent laundry

00:29:21.139 --> 00:29:28.090
detergent because we're all going to die

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.090
someday anyway the end that's it

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:35.520
and scene but you got to play it up with

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:37.960
like a little bit of irony in it as well

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.390
like your did not irony sorry but

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.640
self-awareness you know it's not like

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:44.290
laundry detergent we're all gonna die

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.050
someday anyway like it's got to be a

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:49.180
beat like yo buy fabric softener because

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.320
one day we'll be food for worms and then

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.280
you know put it up a bit

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:58.230
that's the intel jingle you think it'll

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.230
work I'm telling you millennial liaison

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:08.320
Kentucky Fried Chicken no one day

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.580
they'll live in robot bodies regardless

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.650
so it doesn't matter what you put into

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.320
your system right now due to to the

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.730
Intel they I mean that one's got it it's

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.430
got it some work done let's be honest

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.170
but that the Intel jingle is a big part

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.690
of this I mean I gotta you know rome

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:26.010
wasn't built in a day you think like the

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:29.430
you know beef it's what's for dinner

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:35.320
people invented that overnight

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:36.700
Ahsan that was workshop there's a couple

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.650
of rules from millennial life don't

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.050
don't approach a millennial on the

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:45.730
telephone you can text the Millennial

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:49.180
and say can I call you and then they

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:50.770
probably will not respond and then like

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.350
six hours later they'll be like sorry I

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:58.300
was busy can I call you tomorrow and

00:30:53.350 --> 00:31:00.130
then you'll say yes and then you'll set

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.410
up a time and then ten minutes after

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.330
that time they will call you that's the

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.550
first step of contacting a millennial I

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.750
say this is someone who does that exact

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:10.860
same thing it's coming from a place of

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.860
love I promise you that

00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:22.009
trying to think of the other rules never

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:23.869
ask them to see a Tim Burton film that's

00:31:22.009 --> 00:31:26.869
probably like roulette number like 600

00:31:23.869 --> 00:31:29.330
but it's on their dad I don't wanna see

00:31:26.869 --> 00:31:31.309
a Tim Burton film I mean if he made

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:34.309
another Edie would sure but I don't want

00:31:31.309 --> 00:31:36.529
to see Johnny Depp I don't know why I'm

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:38.629
doing this voice I think I'm actually

00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:42.580
doing a parody of myself and I've given

00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:42.580
myself this voice I don't understand

00:31:43.869 --> 00:31:53.269
never talked about using homes as an

00:31:49.489 --> 00:31:55.489
investment because you should be aware

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:59.029
of the fact that the speculators market

00:31:55.489 --> 00:32:01.700
is making it impossible for anybody in

00:31:59.029 --> 00:32:03.709
our demographic to own property unless

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.509
of course they have abstained from

00:32:03.709 --> 00:32:07.159
eating avocado toasts for their whole

00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:10.239
lives in which case the down payment

00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:10.239
basically makes himself

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:19.999
[Music]

00:32:13.179 --> 00:32:22.089
excuse me sir thank you these are the

00:32:19.999 --> 00:32:24.559
rules for interacting with Millennials

00:32:22.089 --> 00:32:28.279
minded that might be a little Vancouver

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:29.719
specific I don't know well first he

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:31.399
railed on religion and now on

00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:33.259
Millennials and baby bloomers is there

00:32:31.399 --> 00:32:38.239
anything he won't touch that's right I'm

00:32:33.259 --> 00:32:40.279
saying it no sacred cows

00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:43.820
speaking of which mozzarella is not that

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:45.589
good of a cheese I'm not against it but

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.149
give me a chatter over a mozzarella any

00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:49.909
day of the week outside of a pizza

00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:51.859
context am i right or am i right I'm

00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:55.219
you're all thinking it I'm just the only

00:32:51.859 --> 00:32:56.869
one with the cojones to say it it's

00:32:55.219 --> 00:33:04.909
actually like my least favorite genre of

00:32:56.869 --> 00:33:06.269
comedy awful opinion you're all thinking

00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:09.929
it

00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:11.190
most of the time not really but there

00:33:09.929 --> 00:33:11.990
are there are comedians who are very

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:16.169
good at that

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:19.740
and that's a tough line to the hit so I

00:33:16.169 --> 00:33:24.659
respect it but also convenience one very

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:26.820
bad at it you just give me yeah I was

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:30.240
gonna say you don't give me an advantage

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.830
there you don't give me a guaranteed

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.559
item it's basically what I should have

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:43.889
said there okay you never give me an

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:48.090
item you only give me a golden HP and as

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:57.110
I fight the mega satan nightly my streak

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:57.110
grows you actually gave me guppy

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:08.309
previously it's been rare occasion in

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:11.030
the middle of the gameplay motion right

00:34:08.309 --> 00:34:14.480
laughs an hour boo

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:17.220
anyway easy win 30 minutes

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.679
Magus Satan we've had a lot of runs like

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:22.139
this recently where we've been like

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:25.230
markedly too slow to make boss rush and

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:27.470
then like finish the whole run within 30

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.470
minutes

00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:34.799
my least-favorite jesse eisenberg film

00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:36.950
within 30 minutes that's what it was

00:34:34.799 --> 00:34:40.349
localized as here

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:42.059
not true people have probably forgotten

00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:46.349
about the existence of 30 minutes or

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:49.020
less I once when I left Korea I lived in

00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:50.520
the city called Daegu which is large but

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.960
not one of the two largest so people go

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.960
what's it like living in a small town of

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.420
three million people but anyway I had a

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.040
6:00 a.m. flight from Daegu to Seoul who

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.319
they actually gave me an entrance here

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.540
okay I had a 6:00 a.m. flight from Daegu

00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:06.720
to Seoul which is like 40 minutes and I

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:09.210
had like a midnight flight or something

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.710
like that from Seoul to Vancouver and

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.930
then from Vancouver back to Toronto but

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:16.049
so I had a 14 hour or something layover

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:17.790
at Incheon International Airport great

00:35:16.049 --> 00:35:18.400
Airport to have a layover app of 14

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:22.630
hours

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:25.059
ridiculous especially as like a 22 year

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.829
old who is like I this is my fourth time

00:35:25.059 --> 00:35:31.599
in an airport you know I didn't really

00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:33.760
know if I knew now or if I knew then

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:35.650
what I know now it that could have been

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.809
a much better layover you know for like

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:43.900
40 bucks so you can just buy lounge

00:35:37.809 --> 00:35:47.529
access for most airliners let's see what

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:49.660
we get here so literally for the cost of

00:35:47.529 --> 00:35:51.279
like three dollars an hour I could have

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.619
had unlimited food and drink including

00:35:51.279 --> 00:35:55.299
alcoholic beverages instead I sat on a

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:57.880
chair and I watched 30 minutes or less

00:35:55.299 --> 00:35:59.710
like four times because it was one of

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.299
the only movies I had on my laptop I

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:04.829
didn't even like it the first time was

00:36:01.299 --> 00:36:04.829
like okay only three more times to go

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:12.819
little Airport little Airport hack for

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:15.819
you there's probably no topic more

00:36:12.819 --> 00:36:19.990
boring than air travel but that doesn't

00:36:15.819 --> 00:36:23.799
stop us oh you know so it was following

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:27.069
Emirates along the 787 all it's so

00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:29.319
gorgeous oh yeah I look the 787 with the

00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:31.180
dynamically tinted windows I love it

00:36:29.319 --> 00:36:32.710
although the cabin pressure makes you

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:37.990
feel so much better when you arrive you

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:41.319
know everyone's uh but I mean it's

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:44.230
because planes are cool like I feel the

00:36:41.319 --> 00:36:46.869
way about planes that I imagine normal

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:48.490
children felt about dinosaurs like I

00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:50.500
never really got dinosaurs when I was a

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:51.910
kid just people were like I really like

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.049
dinosaurs and I was like it's just an

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:58.630
animal you idiot

00:36:53.049 --> 00:37:02.740
moron you absolute maroon it's just a

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:03.849
big animal but now I get it you're like

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.279
well why do you like airplanes because

00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:07.839
it's a miracle that they exist and we

00:37:06.279 --> 00:37:09.819
treat it as if it's just an everyday

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:10.500
occurrence that we should take for

00:37:09.819 --> 00:37:13.390
granted

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.930
also I flew across the entire planet the

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:18.039
other day

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:21.910
oh but were you one a good airliner a

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:24.539
bad airline that they offer you the

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:24.539
quiche Lorraine

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:34.099
that's going to hurt we might tap out

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.900
here on the on the Delirium fight I'm

00:37:34.099 --> 00:37:38.839
like 50/50 when we get a sustained

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:42.920
delirium like this easiest money of all

00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:46.069
time I thought I heard a foot come in

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.710
there but when we have other bosses that

00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:56.750
can tell a Fraga it becomes a little bit

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:59.990
more of a problem I now think we will

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:01.849
probably succeed I know it's a what a

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:13.069
dynamic experience it changes on the

00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:14.839
drop of a hat I will say though the 787

00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:16.490
is pretty dope ever since they fixed

00:38:14.839 --> 00:38:24.290
that bug that caused them to catch fire

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:28.089
midair that was a bummer we did it and

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:28.089
actually did it fairly easily as well

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:35.270
not the bug I mean then let's be honest

00:38:33.049 --> 00:38:37.010
I don't have to know how in the elbow

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:39.530
