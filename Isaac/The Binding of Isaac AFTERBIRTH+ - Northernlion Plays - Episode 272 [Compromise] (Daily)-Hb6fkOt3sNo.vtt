##

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.429
hey everybody welcome back to her online

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.529
place with my name as a guide to earth

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.700
plus ah we didn't do too badly on

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.919
yesterday's day let me through it all

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.860
the way on the Delirium fight but that's

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.040
that's a matter of principle man I think

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.150
I am uploading right now so it is like

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.490
wicked slow to try to see how I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.840
performed yesterday I'm tanking down the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
leaderboard yesterday though we came

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.420
75th 0.84% I was in score thirty two

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.189
thousand six hundred and seventy today

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.559
it is a Isaac run that goes to mom's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.890
heart it appears just give it a second

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.440
here

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
I'm just hooking more Internet SQL query

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
to make sure that it returns a brimstone

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.539
on the first item room yeah it's an

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610
Isaac run it goes to mom's heart the top

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.680
score is fifty one thousand but within

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
the top ten or so there's like thirty

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.649
thousand not thirty thousand people that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.030
would be ridiculous but no also I call

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.390
the SQL instead of sequel I apologize I

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.280
am still an idiot at heart uh we don't

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.680
want Pokeball we don't really want

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.619
betrayal either but I don't know why I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.080
didn't I believe I meant least there I

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.729
can't really get up to that pee-wee

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
Herman level paul rubens you know he's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.189
got a higher pitched voice to me he's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.450
also got more first names than me never

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.920
really thought about it that way but I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.110
can't deny the truth in the heat of the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.390
moment here

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.439
so yesterday I mean we came 75th so I'm

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.880
not going to act like yesterday's was

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.380
bad but we could have been top fifty if

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.479
I just beat delirium and maybe took a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.159
little bit less damage but today's run

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.860
there is no chance for delirium so we

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.650
are spared from that could be a secret

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.790
room there and you know it's no secret

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.130
if you've been watching the eyes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.979
together soaps that hasn't been the best

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.720
run of form lately what can I say you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.360
know everyone goes through hardships in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.920
their lives and you know I'm not trying

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.500
to say that this is like the worst thing

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.299
that's ever happened to me but it is

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.430
like unconscionable the luck that the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.979
game has given me I mean a lesser man

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.680
than myself absolutely would have folded

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.649
under the pressure it takes a strong

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.959
backbone and intestinal fortitude to be

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.640
able to stand up to the kind of

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.260
discrimination that Isaac is giving me

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.040
right now so I really you know I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.659
appreciate

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.099
all your support during this trying time

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:22.260
I'm obviously being a little facetious

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.400
I'm hoping but not feelings too likely

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.439
we're going to get enough money to go to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.329
the shop here but we could save a key

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:32.459
ride a cowboy by putting a bomb down

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:35.010
he missed okay we can use our last bomb

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.519
for that we also like should go but it's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.069
not we don't go immediately so just slow

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.780
your roll here because we can also shoot

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.400
these we don't need a spear at hardy

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.500
epic we might want a spear and art by

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.700
the end of the the floor depending on

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.819
how things look but if we can get a

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:57.500
great item by blowing up our shopkeeper

00:02:50.819 --> 00:03:00.209
that might be better right it's tough

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.370
it's tough because hive mind is like

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.720
pretty solid especially if we were ever

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.519
to get guppy but I think I'm without a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.549
spear and our being in there I'm just

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.439
going to accept that like 12 cents is

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.700
pretty sweet

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.790
we bought a card it wasn't really very

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.199
good but 12 cents allows us to probably

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.609
buy something from our next floor we got

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.629
a spear oh darn anyway and it allows us

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:27.120
to have a chance at getting a and

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.099
getting a an arcade so I think that this

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.090
is really the right idea and if we are

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.669
going to mom's heart we do have like the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.030
problem that I always have on dailies or

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.370
trying to find a seam however we don't

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.069
have to find that seam until the womb if

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.479
we can afford to and then we really are

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.340
only missing out on one floor if we

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.930
missed this even that's Sheol of course

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.329
the show as a self-sacrifice room then

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:58.949
you know things are different but you

00:03:51.329 --> 00:04:01.349
gotta keep this you take it you take it

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:05.510
okay that sucks you take it it's

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:09.750
irrelevant you take it don't Nine Lives

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.389
excellent item amazing item tears down

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.409
pretty horrible honestly All Things

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:19.650
Considered had to play chicken there a

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:21.060
little bit we like desperately it's

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
unfortunate really that we got that

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.120
tears upgrade there sorry tears down

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.430
Gregg's we're really in a situation

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.540
where if I take damage too much on this

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.160
floor will come

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.990
my deal with the devil compromising the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.760
deal with the devil unravels the whole

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.740
run you know the moral fiber of this

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.600
issac episode in which we you know

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.950
murder our own mother at the end of it

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.700
it's all going to come unraveled it's

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.380
not okay that was a good guess and it

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.650
worked out we do only have one key right

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.890
now but we've got 26 cents and that's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.270
pretty solid as well we got 26 cents now

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.640
we have three spirit arts and we had

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.730
that some extra consumables as well so I

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.650
would like to go to whatever room does

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.720
not have a chance to border the secret

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.950
room if in doubt always go to the shop

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.190
especially if you've got enough money to

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.540
buy an item and the key or we get a hope

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.040
for another key to drop right now and

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.620
it's exactly what happened in the end

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.240
angry fly is not good enough s placebo

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.470
is good enough although I'm not fully

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.450
convinced of its greatness

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.590
I do accept it as a valid and valued

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.960
part of our Isaac ecosystem right now if

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.790
we don't get damage upgrades explosivo

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.510
is going to be like you know a dream

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.520
come true

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.870
the problem with Expos Evo is that we

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.320
get better expose evoke gets worse

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:38.670
because the could it be that's my

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.250
defense mechanism that's my safe word is

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.200
I just started singing men at work songs

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.000
you could be good pretty good be good

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.530
I'm cutting into our battlegrounds

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.530
episodes for this week so that's my bed

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.220
trying to say what are the other ones

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.800
no overkill covered in battlegrounds

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.720
didn't really cover the story of dr.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.790
heckle and mr. jive in battlegrounds

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.150
anyway see I'm in my safe spot now I'm

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.920
talking about 1980s bands people think

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.020
are one-hit wonders but actually had

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.560
like at least five bangers which is

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.030
pretty good it's like being an NHL you

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.080
know first-round draft pick you know

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.640
like thirty percent of them end up going

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.590
on to play more than 100 games in the

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.960
NHL or something like that so five

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.030
bangers that's a pretty good track

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.800
record as far as I'm concerned so I mean

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:35.270
er flies it's great item red candles

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.270
great item but we don't really want to

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.600
take it I think even though our damage

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.640
is bad I'm relying on us being able to

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.800
get out of this but if this floors boss

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.840
fight doesn't have anything incredible

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.070
we might feel slightly differently not

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.770
boss fight but deal with the devil

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.270
mostly so I did try to buy myself an

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.960
extra you know ten seconds or so by

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.190
killing pin with a single bomb I don't

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.750
want to drop anymore because we might

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.300
need them we haven't found a secret room

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.410
on this floor for example but I want to

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.850
see what the see what the devil is then

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.200
we'll use our rerolls appropriately like

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:10.910
that deserves to be rear old the shovel

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.590
I'm going to take a gamble and I'm going

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.660
to reroll the shovel and it became the

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.200
razor blade which is no good but well

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.920
not good for us at least but I will also

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.090
accept that this was stupid and I should

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.740
not have done this you should have stuck

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:29.510
with the shovel but I mean you buy this

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.510
for 15 cents then you pick up one of

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:38.060
everything but something's wrong balm

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.770
temperance card and then the Bible but

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.750
then on top of the Bible we got this

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.980
extra d6 that should reroll everything

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:47.210
right and then we get there's options

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.150
get box of friends which you can't do

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.640
anything with I really am the hesitant

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:57.280
to go look for a secret room but we

00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.490
should if we can somehow get you know

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.230
another penny which is what we just got

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.970
we can now get none sabot which is

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.370
excellent now is this all worth it I

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.930
don't know we gave up our seem but I

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.320
gave up my scene because we don't need

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:14.060
the scene for like a little while we

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.040
will take the temperance card though we

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.540
don't need to seem for a little while so

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.660
I'm hoping that the shovel ends up being

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.910
irrelevant so why even take why even

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.380
take the shovel to begin with then I

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.450
want to deal with the devil president to

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.710
be honest with you so on curse of the

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.900
labyrinth which is actually like a

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.810
pretty good blessing for us here because

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:35.360
I want to go faster and an excel floor

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.520
is going to allow us to do that honestly

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.229
if you had told me at the start the

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.640
situations that would have presented

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:43.089
themselves I think I would have made the

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.200
same decisions I might have reer old a

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:46.900
silver taking the shovel I think but I

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:53.080
might have rear old

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:54.340
mom's panties instead of instead of

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.050
reroll in the shovel because the

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.090
razorblade functionally gives us nothing

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:02.140
as does mom's panties that we could have

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:05.650
rear old the panties instead so we're

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:08.530
like it's going to be slow just accept

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.750
that and your life will be a little

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:14.940
easier here we're dealing with base

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:17.440
damage with a diminished rate of fire

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.700
the big thing that's good for us I mean

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.230
we should have shot the poops I guess

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.880
but the big thing that's good for us

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.730
right now is the fact that we have x+

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.240
Evo so if we land 1x placebo shot most

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:30.640
enemies will die but this floor it's

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.610
like non-negotiable we have to improve

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:36.100
ourselves and of course now because we

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:39.070
said no to a the scene that was given

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:42.730
which is like a number one lesson like

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.740
do not do that however you know rules

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.540
are made to be broken that's an

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.680
expression I don't understand I can't

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:52.090
think of - my honest the estimation I

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.720
can't think of a single rule that was

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.720
made to be broken

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:03.210
like we'd probably want to reroll that

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:05.380
celtic cross is less worthy of a reroll

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.060
so yeah let's let's go for this one

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.550
first

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.920
so Aquarius is not that good

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:16.930
I mean I'm leaving Celtic Cross as well

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.030
because that could be worthy of a reroll

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:22.240
I'm going to endeavor to not get to hit

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:24.360
that much but yet like I can't think of

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.240
a single rule that's made to be broken

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.950
you know there are rules maybe it's not

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.570
that this rule was made with the

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:37.270
intention that people break it maybe

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.620
it's that you know the only reason you

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.670
can break the rule is because there's a

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.470
rule in the first place because I was

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.570
thinking of like speeding you know

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.340
speeding is a rule that in my opinion is

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.960
not made to be broken are there

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.830
situations in which it's sensible to

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:54.910
break it yeah you know it's like your

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.800
wife's going into labor you get on the

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.370
highway and people are going mad slow

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.510
goes of speed

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.800
don't let me stop you man you know even

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.180
as I say that I know there's gonna be

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.400
some people out there that are gonna be

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.990
like well you should gun in the color

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.070
twenty minutes earlier you know things

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:18.720
happen okay I'm not I needed to find out

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:22.920
who killed Laura Palmer I'm going to

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.450
blow this up we don't need to be out of

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:29.790
this floor until 13 minutes dude that

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:32.370
was a great value unexpectedly so we're

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.860
still kind of like I mean with low speed

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.490
not amazing damage Aquarius

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:40.530
it almost is like calling to me like hey

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:43.860
I'll kill Lyla Sue's guys for you and

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:46.530
I'm like no you you succubus I will not

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:50.940
take you Aquarius this is not your time

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.720
to shine so we got to like really amp up

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.590
these rerolls

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:58.500
we're not yet in a dire spot for like

00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:01.050
missing boss rush that was pretty bad

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.970
but we could be pretty easily to be

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.770
straight up with you like if we leave

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.630
this floor in 15 minutes and we have two

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.100
full-length floors to go to and we don't

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.440
get a deal with the devil which is like

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.680
the most likely outcome right now that's

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.180
not a good situation for us kidney stone

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.250
is like not good but we have to

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.560
compromise at some point a kidney stone

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.990
is also speed down right so I'm an idiot

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.960
it makes perfect sense the kidney stone

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.490
as it tears down I just always forget

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.260
and that's a Celtic Cross because I felt

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:35.520
like we were you know running out of

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:38.040
time here okay probably you know a Dodge

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.720
you don't like to have to make on 0.8

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.160
speed but we're good

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.320
recognize I did leave a bomb back there

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.600
you know on a daily you got to make

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:55.290
sacrifices to get where you're going in

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:57.630
time I wish it weren't so but let's like

00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:00.860
in order of what we need the most right

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:05.160
now for God's sakes

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:07.800
some freaking tears up graves speed

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.240
upgrades and damage upgrades started at

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.790
first I was like this is a pretty good

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.240
run why why are all the other idiots who

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.980
normally beat the pants

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.720
solve me doing so bad today and then you

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.290
go you know one floor deeper and you go

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.370
home

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:22.839
enemies have more HP right now and it's

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.529
not quite as easy as it originally

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:29.560
looked huh

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:31.060
we're not so different you and I expose

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:36.640
evil gets hard countered pretty hard by

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:40.120
you know enemy spawners so it's annoying

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:43.720
but is being done I don't know how many

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:46.959
times I shot that dude the best of my

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:50.080
knowledge there I shot him a million

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:53.529
times and he did not die that seems

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.810
unreasonable to me I'm just you know

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:58.930
just one man's opinion it's a really

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.940
perfect time to get a golden key all

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:04.600
right big Hornets it's the rule of the

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:06.279
is the rule of there's got to be a good

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.709
name for it here rule of threes already

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:11.440
taken you know it's it's the rule that's

00:14:08.709 --> 00:14:13.930
made to be Big Horn broken now this is

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.829
look brains broken coffee might not have

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:20.260
quite hit the bloodstream yet the rule

00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:24.209
is if you have bad damage you're going

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.209
to fight Bighorn it's just science

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.630
trust me among all the people listening

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.700
to this I'm the one who is the most

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:35.970
wishes that that weren't true I also

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.970
should like really stop walking into

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.040
Bighorn he counters the Christ out of

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:49.450
Expo steve-o to itself what can you do

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:51.370
what can you do I hate it okay this is

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.399
where we you know we decide whether or

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:57.670
not we're going to be good at video

00:14:54.399 --> 00:15:00.160
games because like this is a big pivotal

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:03.100
moment for us stop walking into X

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:08.100
placebo that's like a very important

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.100
first part of this healing process here

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.260
and then you know it's big a horn you

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.630
know you drop a bomb against him when

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.640
he's got his mouth open and life's

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:25.050
better okay we screwed our deal with the

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.580
devil but I don't know when his mouth is

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.470
open by the way his mouth is open

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.480
everyone always goes he'll just drop a

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.360
bomb against them whose mouth is open

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:38.160
for approximately you know one

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:44.180
millisecond every 35 millennia excuse me

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:46.620
will any he's done it he's done it

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:50.520
toothpicks has to be done HP means

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:54.330
nothing to us right now and I mean even

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.750
the stain is not like an automatic win

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.750
here

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.610
I will admit you know 11% chance of a

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:12.660
deal with the devil it's got me thinking

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:14.580
so maybe there's a chance what I called

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.810
it by the way 15 minutes to make it to

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.210
through oh my god

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:24.060
to make it to freakin boss rush never

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:26.370
should have taken kidney stone dude it's

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.050
like get for having like pet items room

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.900
kidney stones not quite as bad as the

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:38.339
mean internet makes it seem then it

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:40.890
rewards me for my service with a speed

00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:42.450
downgrade a bunch of freaking explosivo

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.120
shots launched against enemies that go

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:49.890
under the ground like we have done no

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:57.560
damage to this guy we got to hit him

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:57.560
like he's got to eat it that's the thing

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.810
Nicholas I'm your best friend in this

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:11.939
universe but I could be your angle or

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:13.679
your devil why why do this and then it's

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:16.040
a stain that doesn't even shoot so the

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:19.890
expo steve-o shots don't even work oh

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:22.079
mylanta okay you know what though still

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:26.370
got eleven percent chance in a way it

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:29.340
might even be better than beating the

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:32.010
boss after getting hit once although it

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.750
is going to cost us infinity time so I'm

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:39.840
just going to go ahead and say it boss

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:43.590
rush is very very unlikely here that's

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:48.210
how you do it what the surrogate shots

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:50.780
did not make it you don't understand

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.309
this is nonsensical

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.980
like the expo steve-o shots will not

00:17:53.309 --> 00:18:00.080
explode on the same it's like he's

00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.080
engineered to counter my run right now

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:16.590
this is hell hell has a name and it's

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:23.130
freaking John Daly the host of The Daily

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:28.529
Show oh my god

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:29.809
ok ok ok ok ok ok ok forget everything

00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:34.919
you thought you knew about this run

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:37.669
we're not going to fight the boss right

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:40.440
now because I hate him and I need bombs

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:43.169
it's the worst thing on planet earth but

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.640
is it is what it is so here's I'm a

00:18:43.169 --> 00:18:47.100
smart boy check this out

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:51.929
ok good good work team the magician

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:54.600
doesn't do anything for us stem cells

00:18:51.929 --> 00:18:57.149
for regen see we don't have a bomb it's

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.980
kind of a problem here so we're

00:18:57.149 --> 00:19:00.570
definitely going to die on the way out I

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.240
thought we'd get a bomb there is the

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:07.200
thing all right that happens I'm not

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:12.090
really worried about this life case

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:16.230
that's not abundantly clear what we're

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:19.529
going to do is take every available

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.970
advantage to improve our stats on this

00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:25.620
run so we're going to go to all these

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:26.940
stupid freakin bonus rooms over here

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.880
we're going to say goodbye to boss rush

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:36.510
in a way I almost think that this is a

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:38.970
very advanced level daily because you

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.950
have to say well I have to say goodbye

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.649
to boss rush right away goodbye boss

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.000
rush there's just no chance and for us

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:49.590
to get an Excel floor not be able to

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.809
make it as hilarious but did we get is

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.580
it all the tiers downgrade and kidney

00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:56.149
stone that's like compromising this I

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:59.309
don't think so dude I just think like I

00:19:56.149 --> 00:20:01.490
mean the 0.8 speed admittedly doesn't

00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:01.490
help

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:08.570
you know if you ever want to figure out

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:10.760
what items you absolutely hate try being

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.820
forced to use the money well that's not

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:16.400
I did have the deep-six but try picking

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.840
them up on a on a run in which you

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.690
basically compulsively

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:25.700
compulsively have to beat the mom fight

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.320
within 20 minutes you'll figure out what

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.179
items are your friends and which ones

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.809
aren't pretty freakin quick I promise

00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:34.460
you this so we got 20 cents to be we

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:36.980
bought mom's key from our shop so our

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.620
shop is like is juice there's nothing

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.240
else we can pick up maybe we can get a

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:44.000
spirit arm maybe there's a card or

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:47.030
something but speaking of which we do

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.100
have a temperance card somewhere did I

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:57.860
leave it over the spikes that seems like

00:20:49.100 --> 00:21:00.860
something I could do but this I don't

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.809
know maybe like once everyday now all

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.880
the golden bombs are godlike thank you

00:21:02.809 --> 00:21:07.970
once every day now I have a run in which

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.850
we're on the third to fourth floor and I

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:13.700
find myself being like hey there's like

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:15.590
literally no extra damage here so what's

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.870
what gives where's the cream filling and

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:20.860
then they say you can't handle my cream

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:24.980
filling traveler my cream filling would

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:29.950
put even the most sweet tooth man in the

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.950
grave much less a savory boy like you

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:35.270
he's like you know what I think I'll

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.580
hang out indefinitely above ground oh

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.130
wait you have X plus evil ok sorry what

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:43.100
I meant to say is like I'm going to drop

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:45.340
immediately what what he touched a red

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.340
poop

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.290
he's done it he's done it

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.540
give me the I need the deal give me the

00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.010
deal he didn't get the deal but he got

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.890
two different kinds of speed upgrades

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:05.200
absolutely all right okay one point for

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:07.950
speed like our long national nightmare

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.950
is over

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:19.960
screw it dude you know what I have the

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:23.890
best luck on these dailies when I just

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:27.690
embrace the madness when I say you know

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:32.020
how's Annie and I just go full-on like

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:35.050
the hard Jesus I do hate this daily but

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.220
that's you know in a way it's nice to

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.500
know where you stand with it daily

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:41.710
because often times I find myself being

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.480
all wishy-washy oh how do I feel oh well

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.070
I could have I made some mistakes let's

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.780
turn the lens of criticism inward you

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.600
know what screw that dude let's turn the

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.800
lens of criticism outward fudge today's

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.800
daily that's right I said it

00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:04.930
now that we've embraced the dark side

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:07.720
let's get nonsensical on these enemies

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.820
here so the game plan for this floor it

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.710
doesn't get any simpler than this it's

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:17.170
literally the game plan every time thank

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:19.990
you thank you get a deal with the devil

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:22.980
and for god sakes

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:25.300
please get it tears or damage upgrade oh

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:29.020
I can tell you where the seam is on

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:32.560
today's daily 9 not in terms of making

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.240
it to the mom fight or sorry the the

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.040
Sheol area maybe like you know getting a

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.660
shovel that's the obvious scene the

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.460
others seem in terms of like getting

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:43.480
more damage is being more aggressive

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:45.910
with your rerolls Celtic Cross not a bad

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.490
item occasional invincibility has helped

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.410
me out a little bit but kidney stone was

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.850
the wrong choice I would have been 10

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:55.730
times better off just sticking with

00:23:51.850 --> 00:24:04.130
aquarium to be straight with you so

00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:06.440
and by aquarium I mean Aquarius but now

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.029
we're free in a way you know if it takes

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.500
us 40 minutes to beat mom's heart it

00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:15.909
takes us 40 minutes to be mom's heart

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:18.049
what do we care if we can get

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:21.200
invincibility not invincibility but a

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:26.690
holy mantle from our trinket you're done

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:29.570
you can't do anything you dusted you

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.590
have to and then you can reroll that oh

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:38.179
mylanta

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:40.850
okay look of revelations take this I

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:43.549
think this could be a secret room it's

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.929
worth trying it's not let's go get

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:47.929
ourselves something better so our range

00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:50.870
should be bad but do keep in mind we did

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:52.880
get a mom's panties earlier which I was

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:56.950
not happy about but now you know that

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.950
could change see you later

00:24:57.399 --> 00:25:01.370
we do still want to re-roll Book of

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:06.230
Revelations but it existing is pretty

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:08.120
good 36 percent chance of deal with the

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:11.510
devil the 36 percent chance is because

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.860
we did oh my god it's the only thing

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:17.210
that makes sense for this daily is to

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:19.190
give us 18 lives so I accept fully that

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:22.309
this is this is our lot in life yeah

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:24.889
there it is our 18th life sure dude why

00:25:22.309 --> 00:25:26.809
not my name is number 9 and 18 live

00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:29.419
sadly because of relatively poor

00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:30.769
performance we're on 14 lives here every

00:25:29.419 --> 00:25:32.659
role this thank you for the double item

00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:34.519
room by the way none of this helps us

00:25:32.659 --> 00:25:35.990
from a damage standpoint but I'm making

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:40.010
the decision to take this and I think

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:41.630
that the mind is a terrible thing to

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.970
waste no it's just a great item to begin

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:47.860
with because this run is not a daily

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:51.380
anymore this is a run about survival and

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:54.019
the mind is a surviving focused item

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.510
it's a survivor it's not going to give

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:59.679
up its guns it's not going to stop it's

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:02.510
going to work harder it's a survivor

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:05.690
it's going to make it it's going to

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:08.870
thrive and keep on surviving Destiny's

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.620
Child a band that survived long enough

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.840
to put out

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.780
albums then one of its members

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:18.200
catapulted into mega stardom left

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:23.960
everybody else behind um well that's not

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:27.770
fair Kelly Rowland did do dilemma with

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:30.050
Nelly um give it go for rerolls here

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:34.550
just not quite good enough like this

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:36.200
guy's okay let's not spend any more

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.350
money spend bombs instead where we got

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.910
sharp plug I know we don't have the

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.480
money for but we could get the money if

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:46.130
we need to none of this is worth it

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:53.540
maybe the three cent spear at heart so

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:55.910
I'll grab that I have no idea by the way

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:59.020
what are like upper maximum four scores

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:01.760
today could be and that's not just like

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:04.490
you know seeding some absurdity I

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:08.320
actually that was really dumb I actually

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:10.670
have no clue where we stand

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.960
seems like we'll be at like 10,000 when

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:15.830
we go down to the next floor that's

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:17.000
pretty low with no boss rush chance I

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.630
don't know we could finish today and

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.070
like the twenty five thousand if we're

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:27.710
if we're a little on the lucky side

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:30.500
maybe I have never had a run in which I

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:32.960
hated X plus Evo this much never in my

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.040
life have I said oh X plus Evo you know

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.290
the big problem with that is you run

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.179
into your bombs all the time and I'll

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.350
take half the blame for that but the

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:40.850
other half might be they were on the

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.040
Deaf's one we have three point five zero

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:46.850
damage and we have a four rate of fire

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:49.300
after taking number one so we that's

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.300
fair

00:27:50.920 --> 00:28:02.470
oh well you go I don't know you go to

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.880
the orbital you go for the spirit

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:06.070
Ottoman tears upgrading its go for this

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:13.000
here's upgrades we probably which is

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:17.410
raised our rate of fire fire into my

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.230
hands and cominius clearance like what

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:22.270
in the world dude

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:27.070
pacifier plus number one is it tears

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:30.520
down grade I'm learning new things every

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:33.040
day all this is it this is our guppy

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.150
moment you know please somehow reroll

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.800
into a guy yeah it wouldn't really make

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:40.830
sense no I can't like sure I'm trying to

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.540
be an absurd boy but there's like

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:46.770
there's no case where that makes sense

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.770
let's not be ridiculous

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:58.450
riddle him with X placebo shots hope he

00:28:54.610 --> 00:29:00.910
doesn't leave no even many jumps he gets

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.920
to take care of them must be nice so

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:05.200
there's going to be like a 32 minute

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.360
boss rush attempt we do still have a

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.590
chance of boss rush with which I should

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.860
have mentioned because it actually is

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:13.450
nonzero we have money we have a shop and

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.660
we have the d6 that means we could get

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:19.870
mama mega and like basically backdoor

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:22.000
into I don't want to blow the Temperance

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:26.280
here we could basically backdoor into

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.600
like the luckiest fonts rush of all time

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:38.350
we can get your hopes up too much but

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:39.310
there is a chance sure still it's okay

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.020
luck up sure

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.610
yeah we've been pretty lucky so far so

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.880
and want to throw a monkey wrench into

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:50.970
that um just give me blood bag just give

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:54.400
me blood bag there we go

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:57.550
funny-looking blood bag but we're one

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.620
guppy item away from becoming guppy if

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.180
we become guppy effectively I think

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.880
we've made every wrong decision on this

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.470
run maybe because we should we should

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.060
have had a hive mind but I don't know

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.890
what do we care about killing rooms

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.810
quickly now as long as we can beat the

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.870
run which is actually still in question

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:15.040
but if we can beat the run it doesn't

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.300
matter if we have hive mind because

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.160
we're not making boss rush anyway

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.350
although boss rush is going to be a lot

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.060
harder to kill with a junk run but if we

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.230
become guppy then we don't have to worry

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:28.120
about having a junk or you see what I

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:29.950
mean like complicated situation if we

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.390
take this we can go into our deal with

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.240
the devil but her sorry our curse room

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:37.330
but it will compromise our deal with the

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.360
devil so this is good this is good

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:42.010
a kick it was temporarily good it was

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.060
good for about two and a half seconds

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:48.040
and now we've returned to a life of pain

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.840
so like oh that was a TBS show that's

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:54.380
right house of pain one of my personal

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.420
favorites that shows not you know

00:30:54.380 --> 00:31:02.420
on the air anymore that's what I was

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:04.300
going to say uh please just let me get

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.490
let me get the deal with the devil at

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:11.300
some point the run leaves my

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:15.140
jurisdiction if we got borderline based

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:17.240
stats by the depths one I'm just a

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:20.630
vessel for anguish to flow through this

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.920
is good good enough at least and if

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.140
we're not doing very much damage like a

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.990
static damage dealer like this is really

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:30.020
nice so I'm very very thankful for this

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:32.660
however we do need to you know start

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.430
busting skulls as well hopefully this

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:40.040
synergizes with ex placebo and we can

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:42.920
just get a poison chain going I'm losing

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.630
my mind dude I can't believe that I had

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.830
the option to get an orbital an item I

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.260
love but I said nah

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:50.510
we broke the tears cap let's go for the

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:54.140
the tears upgrade and it ended up being

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:57.520
appears downgrade like the level of

00:31:54.140 --> 00:32:00.260
indignity there is is outrageous to me

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.480
can't really take advantage of that okay

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.620
so I mean obvious steps I think we have

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.880
to go to our curse room because we're

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.890
one item away from becoming guppy

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:11.240
technically we had three guppy items but

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:14.570
I digress I think we got to look for

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:17.450
blood bag you know one HP means very

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:19.400
little to me if we can get to two that's

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:23.320
worth a lot but half versus one is like

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:26.240
irrelevant okay what if though what if

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.430
that's fair it doubled our damage but

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.840
more than doubled our rate of fire sure

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.870
I mean at this point I don't know what

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.520
I've come to expect why did I take it

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.200
honestly because I thought maybe our

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.180
tears cap was so busted that this would

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.800
somehow help us out but really enough

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:44.020
looking at this I'm like our stats don't

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.020
seem as bad filtered through this lens

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:55.070
we're like surprisingly not that behind

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:57.890
the times point wise in every other

00:32:55.070 --> 00:33:00.860
category that has ever been invented to

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:04.210
measure anything we're not killing it

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:07.910
would be a polite way to put it but

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:10.730
specifically with respect to our points

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:12.380
we're not like grossly under what you

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:15.680
might expect to be added at this point

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:18.560
on a run it's a bad score but it's not

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.710
necessarily a bad score for a terrible

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.960
run we got to try to snag some HP here

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:30.500
we've still got 100% deal with the devil

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:32.870
chance so yeah that's a range plus luck

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:38.150
so that's actually worth thinking about

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:45.230
because our range is not great and luck

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:48.020
is usually nice it's worth going for I

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:50.120
think we don't really want batwing it's

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.360
pretty good but we don't need it right

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.320
now

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:56.000
credit card so free deal with the devil

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.430
right now that's the winner because we

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.350
could use our HP although we in a way we

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.090
almost have unlimited HP for deals of

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:07.580
the devil because our HP is so low you

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:09.740
know so where does that sound so we do

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:11.650
want crystal ball and we got a sphere at

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:18.560
heart which is nice and then we will

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:20.570
rear ol crystal beau Scorpio anything to

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.510
deal damage over time my thinking was

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:26.540
hopefully we can go get a battery charge

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:29.450
there's no battery charge I'm not

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:34.730
sweating it too much to be honest with

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:38.890
you let's take this luck upgrade is nice

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.890
the range upgrade is something

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.089
we'll probably get a hit here I hope we

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:51.470
don't get hit five times and get a

00:34:45.089 --> 00:34:51.470
reroll that'd be a little embarrassing

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:57.510
we need to wait for the foot perfect

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.400
timing

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.080
there we go I mean X placebos never

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.430
going to land on the foot it's never

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:06.740
going to land on anything on this fight

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.740
so Oh get your hopes up too much

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.550
honestly it matters approximately

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:18.599
negative right that's pretty bad it

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:22.580
matters negative a million percent that

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:27.750
I gave up on boss rush because this run

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:34.020
hold up this run had no Avenue for boss

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:36.420
rush to exist nicely done we're fighting

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:39.540
mam 32 minutes in the only Avenue was

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:47.750
those item rooms I think on the on the

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:51.210
caves XL let's go let's go she's poison

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:55.260
okay I mean we don't have reroll so we

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:56.460
take the Polaroid no I mean sure I'll

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.380
tell you what I'll take sister Maggie

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.119
because again our HP is irrelevant right

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.320
now and save the credit card for a

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:03.930
future floor I certainly don't want to

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.140
get a free sister Maggie that seems

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:10.740
idiotic so the game plan here is very

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.720
simple again we have holy mantle so we

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.460
enter this room to try to become guppy

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.859
because that's one of the few avenues

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.859
for ultimate success for us

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:33.330
that was a good time to not get hit so

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:37.660
I'm still like optimistic about our

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:43.030
ability to win today's run I have no

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:45.310
clue what our score is going to be but I

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:49.030
think it's clear that you know whatever

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:51.370
we messed up we at least noticed that we

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:54.400
messed it up and we compromised you know

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:56.740
we weren't going out there in a 1988

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.170
Dodge shadow and going I'm gonna win the

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.660
Daytona 500 we got to the starting line

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:03.490
remember like whoa you know Lamborghini

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.100
huh I'm just going to go to the grocery

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:07.780
store instead and then all we can do in

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.150
life is sometimes try to turn the

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:12.820
Daytona 500 into a good grocery trip you

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:14.800
know sometimes you're writing an exam

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.760
you think you prepared well for it and

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:21.250
then you know first ten questions you go

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:25.860
I don't know the answer to any of these

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:25.860
you just got to enter damage control

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:36.220
Papa Papa he's going to die anyway nice

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:38.350
okay we definitely want to go here 33%

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.260
deal with the devil chance is not

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:43.060
terrible I think I'm going to spend a

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:49.240
bomb to try to get to our boss fight

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:52.240
faster because the boss fight has

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:56.190
guaranteed items dude no combat is my

00:37:52.240 --> 00:38:01.570
jam the boss fight has guaranteed item

00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:03.310
items because of there's options at

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.630
least we got a tinted rock out of it you

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.540
know as far as I'm concerned we broke

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:09.310
even let's go try acted not the easiest

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.990
boss fight there's damage that's tough

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:13.300
to avoid sometimes but he's staying

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:15.690
still explosive Oh wolves run buck wild

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.690
on them

00:38:18.799 --> 00:38:23.760
let's go let's go let's go let's

00:38:21.529 --> 00:38:27.180
continue to go and then let's finish

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.549
going there's no earthly way of knowing

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:35.599
oK we've done it no deal with the devil

00:38:29.549 --> 00:38:39.960
we're going straight for damage okay so

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:44.369
this is an awkward moment to be in not

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:47.970
like Lou the server said enjoy your food

00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:50.849
and I said you too am I ever going to

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:52.349
get laid you know like but more awkward

00:38:50.849 --> 00:38:54.839
in the sense that it's a little finicky

00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:57.119
here you know awkward in like trying to

00:38:54.839 --> 00:39:01.289
fit two LEGO pieces together but one of

00:38:57.119 --> 00:39:03.839
them is actually a mega block so the way

00:39:01.289 --> 00:39:05.460
that we have to find a seam now is we

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:07.589
get an eihwaz room obviously but that's

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.029
pretty low percentage or we find a

00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:11.970
self-sacrificing room on the next floor

00:39:09.029 --> 00:39:14.039
which is actually higher percentage but

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:18.450
we don't have a ton of HP what we do

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:20.039
have are a ton of lives I don't know if

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.200
I would wish a run like that on my worst

00:39:20.039 --> 00:39:25.289
enemy where we go down to the lamb fight

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:31.890
with you know relatively bad stats and

00:39:25.289 --> 00:39:36.920
then one HP that seems like a recipe for

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:39.720
like actual misery and then Am's matters

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.329
sometimes I really do wonder what our

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:44.760
neighbors think of this but they want me

00:39:42.329 --> 00:39:46.730
to stop singing out a key they should

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.750
stop playing the bongos at 3:00 a.m.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:51.599
okay we don't have anything to do with

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:56.359
that that was two weeks ago I've changed

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:56.359
since then I that's add damage hurts me

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:07.690
okay grab this two rooms left on this

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:10.780
floor uh I feel like we've gained zero

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:12.849
points on this floor basically broken

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.010
even but by getting through this floor

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:16.510
we get to get the points that we would

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:21.760
get for going down to the next floor so

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:23.050
you know like you gotta get a couple of

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.819
omelets to make an egg if you know what

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:29.020
I mean uh let's go still got a credit

00:40:27.819 --> 00:40:30.609
card still hoping it works

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.559
I still think even if we don't get the

00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:34.180
used credit card I like this strategy

00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:35.589
more than using the credit card to pick

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:38.589
up sister Maggie which would have you

00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:40.390
know made me feel like basically a piece

00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:43.140
of garbage This Is It this is our goofy

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:45.819
moment we've suffered for 36 minutes

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:50.079
should I open the other one first but it

00:40:45.819 --> 00:40:53.829
did turn out to not matter um I don't

00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:56.710
know this is where we get in the like

00:40:53.829 --> 00:41:01.270
advanced you know or go Isaac's stop at

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:02.770
this point like is it better it's not

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:05.829
like we can get a reroll without leaving

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:07.599
this room anyway even if we get hit you

00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:08.710
know we will charge up thanks to none

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:10.780
tab but we're not going to be able to

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.609
charge up before we die all the way at

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.500
least so we need to like a battery

00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:16.480
charge to drop it are we going to

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.430
compromise the item pool by leaving the

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.329
room to re-roll it later because I mean

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:23.799
little Stephen is sadly somewhat useful

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:26.440
for us because our own damage is not

00:41:23.799 --> 00:41:28.150
that good right now but certainly there

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.520
are better items you can get from a red

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:35.500
chest that would like you know help us

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:36.849
out a lot more right now but we'll love

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.250
I guess we'll cross that bridge when we

00:41:36.849 --> 00:41:41.859
come to it I do see eye or I saw I

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:44.470
should say on the map Rosalie close that

00:41:41.859 --> 00:41:47.230
there is a there's no self-sacrifice

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:49.720
room but there is a dice room a one-room

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:51.549
could mercifully give us like two rooms

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.099
of being good before the runs over a

00:41:51.549 --> 00:41:55.690
five room could reroll the floor but

00:41:54.099 --> 00:42:01.000
allowing us to go back down to it and

00:41:55.690 --> 00:42:02.829
actually lead to lead to a

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.569
self-sacrifice room which would be nice

00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:06.670
and then of course a curse room could

00:42:04.569 --> 00:42:10.219
just have guppy so this floor is kind of

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:13.019
like it's a bounty of riches

00:42:10.219 --> 00:42:18.659
it was not a good use of the holy mantle

00:42:13.019 --> 00:42:20.489
but we must get it back like either

00:42:18.659 --> 00:42:23.639
after X number of rooms with this

00:42:20.489 --> 00:42:25.229
trinket or just like randomly with this

00:42:23.639 --> 00:42:27.809
trinket and then we preserve it until

00:42:25.229 --> 00:42:31.439
it's gone I think so we've got golden

00:42:27.809 --> 00:42:34.049
keys we have to go nuts here you want to

00:42:31.439 --> 00:42:37.319
get nuts let's get nuts okay go ahead

00:42:34.049 --> 00:42:39.149
with credit card I think you go for it I

00:42:37.319 --> 00:42:41.549
don't know what you're looking for but

00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:43.529
we can get a free deal with the devil

00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:51.329
item on our final room we have to give

00:42:43.529 --> 00:42:56.149
it a shot I have to know we are killing

00:42:51.329 --> 00:43:00.539
things not slowly anymore not quickly

00:42:56.149 --> 00:43:05.219
would never say that this is a you know

00:43:00.539 --> 00:43:07.499
an unbelievably strong run luckily our

00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:09.299
hitbox is bigger than his are you

00:43:07.499 --> 00:43:11.249
smaller than his our tears are bigger

00:43:09.299 --> 00:43:13.469
than his I should say and it is a

00:43:11.249 --> 00:43:16.979
three-room so we rolled all consumables

00:43:13.469 --> 00:43:18.839
on the ground so what you do here I

00:43:16.979 --> 00:43:21.089
suppose is go okay well I mean you got

00:43:18.839 --> 00:43:23.099
the emperor card there could use the

00:43:21.089 --> 00:43:26.689
emperor card to get out of the curse

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:29.069
room it's a bad time for kidney stones

00:43:26.689 --> 00:43:30.779
the emperor card to get out of the curse

00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:35.189
room fight the boss and get ready to

00:43:30.779 --> 00:43:36.869
reroll everything on the ground it's

00:43:35.189 --> 00:43:39.769
fairly sensible as much as I hate to

00:43:36.869 --> 00:43:41.939
admit it because it's kind of finicky

00:43:39.769 --> 00:43:47.880
you shouldn't be picking up Keys at this

00:43:41.939 --> 00:43:49.559
point yeah alright so here's how we eat

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.939
a few extra points out of this and

00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:53.569
hopefully get ourselves into the top

00:43:50.939 --> 00:43:53.569
thousand

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:03.100
not the curse room I'm looking for if

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:07.540
we're going in here to save HP we should

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:09.130
not fight demon judgment and buy fight I

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:12.040
mean try to come to a business

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:14.790
arrangement with business is just money

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:18.700
fighting if I've learned anything from

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:21.370
years of international high profile

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:26.170
business business is just like fighting

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:27.340
with money we lost the credit card

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.620
that's hilarious

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:33.550
but we couldn't have used it anyway

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:35.110
that's even more hilarious okay he's got

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:40.780
to get dusted that's the thing he's got

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:42.070
to go we've done it we've done it we

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.200
still have a couple of rooms to fight

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:46.650
here so you know who are babylons got a

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.650
purpose

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.980
I don't think there's any way I mean

00:44:58.089 --> 00:45:02.319
right now we're looking for an a laser

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:05.710
this is going to be like a 20 mm point

00:45:02.319 --> 00:45:08.920
run there are some situations in which

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:12.550
we have more points than that when we

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:15.339
leave boss rush well then there might be

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:17.349
a slight exaggeration so this is not

00:45:15.339 --> 00:45:20.530
indicative necessarily of poor play I

00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:22.270
think poor play has come out of bad

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:25.210
decisions on this one I don't know

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:27.310
though like I think that this is not one

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:30.040
that has an obvious line you know the

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:32.560
obvious line is when your item room just

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.660
contains 20 20 unlike your third floor

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.599
and you go okay well you're going to

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:43.569
have to mess things up pretty good too

00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:50.560
to screw yourself on this one so we're

00:45:43.569 --> 00:45:52.270
looking for a woz we got to go to every

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.609
single no we don't have to go to every

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:57.250
single room we can just look I do see

00:45:54.609 --> 00:45:59.829
some cards cards are runes on the maps

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:02.950
so this is really our only chance for it

00:45:59.829 --> 00:46:09.910
on end chess set suppose there's no more

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:11.950
chests though it's not a rune it's the

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:16.329
Emperor card all right well that's

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:21.280
today's daily twenty one thousand eight

00:46:16.329 --> 00:46:27.400
ninety I got a no I got a no read calm

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:31.380
flesh on flesh Binding of Isaac give me

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:35.290
a second here go to Isaac daily bots

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:37.329
click on the button and x plus c votes

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:39.069
this is a top comment and x + c bow to

00:46:37.329 --> 00:46:40.569
the never pick up on dailies list yes

00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:42.099
you can kill bosses a little bit faster

00:46:40.569 --> 00:46:44.770
but normal room clearing takes forever

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:46.960
also gluttony drops a tears down grade

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.589
ii reroll on x placebo gives money

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.569
equals power

00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:53.859
oh i see game no natural damage upgrade

00:46:52.569 --> 00:46:55.780
saving a rear old causes you to lose

00:46:53.859 --> 00:46:57.369
them for the shovel tanky as all hell

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.990
bosses and small room cramp it's the

00:46:57.369 --> 00:47:01.300
only way to win is to do rooms in

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:03.130
exactly the right order or play badly to

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.400
get rewarded later on screw you to alt

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:05.400
f4

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:09.820
after birth guppy on basement - oh

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:12.970
that's like the non afterbirth plus run

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:15.670
be me playing Isaac daily C

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:17.860
self-sacrifice room on b1 oh cool I'll

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:19.630
get an item to re-roll keep using it

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.680
half hard left when the angel comes up

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.790
immediately kills me

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:30.280
101 17 final score wait 101 seven final

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:31.960
score 10 17 all right apparently in the

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.100
crawl space there's a three dollar bill

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:38.850
and if you reroll explosivo you get

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:43.780
money equals power so that's the seam oh

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:46.000
well we tried I think we did okay we

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:48.580
didn't over commit to boss rush which

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.600
makes this a mild success at least like

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.800
as a you tried sort of like metal thing

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.690
but for now thanks for watching hope you

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.680
enjoyed the episode of ridiculous idea

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.430
of course describe you wanna see more in

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.320
the future but for now thanks for

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:01.320
watching and I will see you next time
