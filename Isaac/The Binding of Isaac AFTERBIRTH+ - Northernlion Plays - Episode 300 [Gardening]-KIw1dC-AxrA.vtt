00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.220
hey everybody welcome back Northern Line

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.600
finding mines again prepares what could

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.519
be greater than golf with the Gators did

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
we I thought we had four wins in a row

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.289
last time and then we're still at four

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:20.130
wins in a row we have no mods on maybe

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.830
I'm just losing my mind that's okay

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.600
last run didn't end up being that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.580
difficult we got ten kegs early and kind

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.560
of balled out of control this one the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:36.210
worst rate of fire WR GPL 0tg

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.190
with an HP upgrade and the d6

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
it's not bad honestly with a bad rate of

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.780
fire at before ax is like one of the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.910
more interesting upgrades that we could

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.469
get in the early game here we're not

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.780
always going to be able to use it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.940
appropriately as I'm sure you can tell

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.370
from our experience here but at before

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.320
is kind of cool I hated it for a while

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
and then I've come to actually

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.559
appreciate it so the big draw for us I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.240
think is the big the thing that we

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.520
should do to try to maximize our chances

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.140
of winning here is not really to use at

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
before to always shoot in the same

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.520
direction when that happens when that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.650
aligns with our abilities that's going

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.350
to be nice but it's not always going to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.119
be possible to ensure that we're

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.040
shooting in the same direction but you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.850
know after 10 or 20 minutes as you can

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.259
see we can get to the point where well

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.340
they can actually see our HP as well

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.900
which is nice oh dude this is amazing

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.220
they said the Joker was a wanted man

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.020
what do you do here well this is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.759
actually potentially how we win the game

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.799
is popped off so quickly here that I'm

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:51.799
like confused but also excited because

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:56.040
empty vessel is incredible we can use it

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.899
you got to take empty vessel and then

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.030
you reroll the other item to try to get

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
empty vessel to pop and got these

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.570
hairball is at least good enough to try

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.160
so we can fly now and I'm going to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.660
highly debatable whether or not this is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.580
even close to the right decision but I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.110
figured I'd give it one chance and it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.760
didn't work okay so if we get back to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.010
the deal with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.049
devilled awesome probably won't but if

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.930
we do that's fine even if we don't

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:29.420
though the the pickup of empty vessel is

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.370
extremely good the principle problem

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.230
that we have right now is you know it

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.299
doesn't actually help us out on a stats

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.480
level although we are thankful to still

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:44.000
like be able to you know deal damage and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.340
fly and also maybe have a faster chance

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.590
to become Guffey if not necessarily a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.970
better chance because we might not even

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.260
though we're guaranteed more or less a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.260
deal with the devil due to our current

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.599
HP compensation or HP composition on the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.069
next floor it's questionable whether or

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.140
not we'd be able to actually take a deal

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.810
with the devil depends on

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.370
well mostly whether or not the deal with

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.290
the devil actually gives us some HP back

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.000
and then maybe whether or not we get HP

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.680
from our existing boss on this floor or

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.459
the boss on the next floor but either

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.810
way empty vessel is great and we're

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.299
happy to have it it just might take a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.310
little while to to come into focus how

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.250
good it actually is it also gives us

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.349
occasional invincibility but we're we

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.540
got a lot of future potential and empty

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:35.739
vessels like a little bit of right now

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:38.329
help as well the problem is more that

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.750
three-point-seven damage and seventeen

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:45.680
rate of fire are pretty poor they're not

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.280
awful I mean three point seven damage is

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.819
okay at least but 17 rate of fire is

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.599
almost none useable that's like Eve's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.579
mascara

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.019
levels of rate of fire and our damage is

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.900
not even close to where we want it to be

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.730
but every run almost every run is even

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.190
starts with like some area that could

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.900
use a little help and it just so happens

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.930
it's our DPS this time but our defense

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.900
should be good I'm going to compromise

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.480
empty vessel temporarily to get a sweet

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.310
sweet tears upgrade which is basically

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.079
essential as far as I'm concerned and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.199
then we're going to execute like a a

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.770
guppy play here so we go into our curse

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.050
room got two spirit hearts which is

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.590
basically like fine we know we're going

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.970
to get a deal

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.699
the devil here I wanted to get back to

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.620
empty vessel as soon as possible and

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:37.570
please jump again our rate of fire can

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.410
get down to six if we really harp on it

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.669
it's not bad

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.110
what's our default rate of fire it's

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:49.160
like 14 I think it's 9 I didn't even

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.300
look when I picked up what I would have

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.040
terrible dodge there I didn't even look

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.160
when I picked up blue cab for the first

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.800
time if our standard rate of fire is 9

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.680
that's like actually completely ok I

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.139
always find like when my tier delay or

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:09.350
is what my rate of fire is really bad ok

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.180
sweet yeah cool um we roll this you

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.419
gotta you've got it even though it ruins

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.770
empty vessel you've got it

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.229
it's fine like if I'm on an Eden run

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.330
where my tier delays kind of garbage one

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.280
tiers upgrade usually like this

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.750
proportionally saves it and I have no

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.970
idea why but it usually see huh it's

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.220
weird right because I'm like I feel

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.280
deprived because I'm not able to grab

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.990
the Maggie's bow but if we were able to

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.669
grab Maggie's bow that would mean we're

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.380
using empty vessel and picking up

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.669
Maggie's bow would ruin empty vessels so

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.910
I don't know if we'd be trapped in the

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.800
middle of that thing or what but

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.419
thankfully maybe we're not able to pick

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.340
it up even if it did let us leave the

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.900
room we'd still be like you know we'd be

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.300
ruining the ability to fly so I don't

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:58.430
feel too badly about that this run is

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:03.260
great now Greg now yeah your magic

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.660
moment great now come on said Van Halen

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.280
I if that's like one of the mid tier

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:12.919
cuts you don't hear it on the radio too

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:16.970
- too much but so we have prayer card

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:20.330
which I'm going to take but we could get

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:23.200
by with the reroll as well I'd like to

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.360
get to ten cents it's going to happen I

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:30.050
don't love that I have to buy re-roll

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.110
here but it's fine ace of diamonds and

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.560
we'll buy the reroll use the prayer card

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.560
once

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.370
so that we get X well I mean I guess

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.440
from one HP do we want to be on two HP

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.620
why not two HP is probably better for

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.180
now it sounds like bad but if we really

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.580
hate being on two HP we could just die

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.009
and go down to one HP and then take a

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.620
deal with the devil like for example it

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.539
follow me to a place where incredible

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.539
feats are achieved every hour or so here

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:04.419
next floor all I did in media 3 HP

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:05.949
that's getting a little crazy

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.979
next floor we walk into a deal with the

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.750
devil ah you know we can't quite get

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.759
back the empty vessel state if we take

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.669
this so we want to have less HP we walk

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:21.220
out bomb ourselves respawn inside of the

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:23.169
deal with the devil grab the item die

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.530
come back as okay now I'm getting

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:27.639
confuse I'm confusing myself here

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.000
disregard I'm getting I'm getting too

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.530
cute with the plays here let's pretend

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.969
as if we don't even have empty vessel

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.229
and then just be happy when it works for

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:37.659
us in the future which would probably

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.880
will how's this run looking well it's

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:43.150
got an OK rate of fire it's got okay

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.889
damage holy light is legitimately one of

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.280
the best tear effects and little brim

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:50.800
like short of getting a huge damage

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.180
upgrade on isn't really the spectrum on

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.279
which I want to compare these little

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.900
brim is like one of the best ways to

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:58.599
deal damage that has nothing to do with

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.349
your own damage stat like as a static

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:04.990
variable repeating of course stored on

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:07.830
the local static area I don't remember

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:10.630
where static variables are stored

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.009
probably on the heap now that our site

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.400
probably on the stack is when I'm okay

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:16.779
look hey nerd if you're talking about

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.509
the stack you better be talking about

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:24.370
magic gathering all right no C++ and my

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:25.930
Isaac the point is regardless of your

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.789
damage little brings amazing so it's

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.560
helping us out quite a lot right now and

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:32.680
can carry us for quite a long time I

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.930
would love to have it not have to carry

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.719
us for quite a long time but truth be

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.849
told if we had to run these stats for

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:42.099
the remainder of the run I think we

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:44.050
could do it my warrants you know a

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:46.390
couple of speed up graves just so we're

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.990
a little bit safer on the dodging front

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.270
but Holy Light combined with

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.460
little brimstone can with it allows us

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.680
to hit above our weight class that's

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.020
what I'm trying to say no deal with the

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.130
devil the polydactyl it's okay

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:05.130
High Priestess basically is a free boss

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:07.350
fight later surprised we didn't fight

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.480
Big Horn considering we have such poor

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:13.890
damage right now which usually have a

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:17.310
game sees fit to punish us is that a

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:20.430
misuse of high priestess it's possible

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:25.710
but you know those mushrooms are as

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:28.590
tanky as some bosses I swear luck stat

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.630
1.31 our shot speed is like god-awful

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.120
which is compromising our effective

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.710
range a little bit I think which is in

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.020
yet another reason my little brim was

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.270
like such an amazing gift for us wiggle

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.690
worm with low shot speed is almost

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:48.530
usable and wiggle worm in general is one

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:51.090
of like the least horrible worm trinkets

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:53.400
ringworm as far as like I would love for

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.920
ringworm to be more useful or at least

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.590
like from a hilarity standpoint useful

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.940
at all but it just isn't like that it

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.890
makes it impossible to hit things it

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.650
also gives you like a three thousand

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:07.320
percent shot speed increase which you

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:11.430
think how could that possibly be bad

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.730
well it sounded way much like life in

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.880
the Jurassic Park films it found a way

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.740
Libra

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.450
you've got to give it a shot I almost

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.220
think this is going to be a damage

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:24.180
downgrade because our shot speed and

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:27.330
speed are so bad it was the mildest of

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:32.960
damage increases but again this means

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:32.960
that every stat upgrade we ever gets

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.420
will be in all stats upgrading every

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.700
stat downgrade we ever get will be a

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.210
stance downgrade so except for luck and

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:48.000
HP weirdly enough but keep this first

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.870
two of nodes in ace of clubs you got to

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
think about this one because we have

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.190
coupon coupon would make the Bible free

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.280
or it could make one of the consumables

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.930
free it could also make deals with the

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.400
devil free but that's not what I want

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.950
I think we'd go for the double re-roll

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.800
here let me take a gift and we'll use it

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:07.209
in here to get a free

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.950
drop item is compost it's not bad but

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:10.810
it's also novel we won what we do want

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:17.830
is champion belt which is and all stats

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:20.610
up now how much though it's not bad

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:23.010
0.42 damage like a 10% damage increase

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.060
and then we going to re-roll mom's purse

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.290
pills are one of the best ways to get

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.290
all stats upgrades but without knowing

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.480
what they are it's a little dicey

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.250
so we rear old it becomes hivemind like

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.230
I'm not against it our chances of

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.000
becoming guppy are pretty good but our

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:43.060
donation machine is also we don't have

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.709
any more back okay maybe this is the

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.930
last time together so just making some

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:48.940
sloppy decisions there's no real

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.040
negative to blowing up your donation

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.730
machine one too many times like we're at

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.810
nine hundred cents who cares right but I

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.060
was like we'll just keep buying battery

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.700
charges endlessly Oh from what battery

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:07.899
store I didn't know you live next to the

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:10.570
Duracell Depot anyway we're headed down

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:13.209
we're on pace it's good should have

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.850
taken mom's purse wait do we hold on

00:12:13.209 --> 00:12:17.079
their brain even while you were

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.029
admonishing yourself for your own

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:20.560
stupidity you never thought for a second

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:22.300
let's go back there and get hive mind we

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.089
got a chance to become guppy people

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.490
screaming at you all the drama people

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:31.180
suing me I'm on TV talking like it's

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:34.600
just you and me Kanye West can't tell me

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:38.920
nothing 2007 you might as well get hive

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.690
mine is what I'm trying to say and why

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:45.010
not use a golden bomb to crack into this

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:46.810
lockup now that's fine you know a job

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.459
well done is its own reward here alright

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.690
there you go see we used to be stopped

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:51.449
hopefully our pattern of

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:54.070
self-destruction here before it became

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:55.510
potentially catastrophic and did we

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.149
compromise our ability to get the boss

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.790
rush yet but we've made our future flies

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:02.769
that much stronger that's worth

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.290
something gosh darn it that's a secret

00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:07.449
room I guarantee it okay guaranteed

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.829
though right here secret room this is

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:12.450
what I meant right there told you

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:17.910
alright next time then

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:19.380
okay let's move on here um we're

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.420
definitely in a previous even with curse

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.550
of the blind oh it's a library actually

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.790
Book of Revelations Anarchist Cookbook

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:29.130
I'll take a Cuba meet Book of

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.260
Revelations also a I always forget it's

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.090
a devil deal chance increase if you're

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:39.870
holding it or maybe an Turkish coke book

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:42.630
is not worth holding but this gives us a

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.520
good outlet to use and abuse battery

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.780
charges on this floor because we know

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.040
what it's going to give us it's going to

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.470
give us something in the category of

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.790
books if we're able to reroll enough we

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.660
might be able to turn it into a doubled

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.750
item room but that would probably

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.570
require like sharp plug or you know a

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.310
pretty fortuitous sack boy or you know a

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.350
room with a king baby that turns all

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.680
enemies in the champions that drop a a

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.900
battery charge or something it's

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:11.850
plausible but semi unlikely at the very

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:14.130
least like this well then we could get

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.800
to battery charge drops here which would

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:19.320
be a start to get one battery charge

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.290
drop here we did get one battery charge

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:27.900
here all right I'm gonna I'm gonna go

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:30.030
against library I hate that I'm going to

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.940
go against library straps just because I

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:36.030
don't think there's enough charges if it

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:38.190
was a five room like five books on the

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.540
library I'd be all over it you know you

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.540
don't need too many charges to make that

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.750
work but we need to an app charges per

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.670
charge

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.620
they've been sounds confusing we need to

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.150
be the equivalent of one charge on a

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.680
five book room we need to get two and a

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:56.420
half charges on a two book room of

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:56.420
course so taro cloth lovely lovely item

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.330
saves us from blowing up our donation

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.350
machine a little bit as well ace of

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.760
clubs I think is like irrelevant but

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.730
we'll turn two cents into two bombs

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.150
regardless grab the compass that's good

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.590
dude then we'll use the moon card but

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.500
don't forget it's not just a moon card

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.390
it's actually a doubled moon card I'm

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.920
going to go to our item room and then

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.630
we've got a seventy two point five

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.920
percent chance repeating of course of

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.260
making it to our deal with the devil

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.040
here at which point we will become guppy

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.660
and our hive

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.089
decision will have paid dividends and we

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.130
will go win the game empty vessel or no

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:34.680
empty vessel great trinket by the way

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.870
bum friend not a huge fan locust of

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.790
pestilence though of course we are going

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:43.019
to take and barely save myself from

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:44.459
walking on the spikes those are the kind

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:46.620
of plays you got to make if you want to

00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:48.329
win a lot of NIH's ik if you want to win

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.800
a lot and Isaac boy it's the toughest

00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:52.110
league in the game you got to make sure

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.730
you don't damage yourself on spikes all

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.069
that often or you're going to be in

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:58.139
trouble mister you can only damage

00:15:56.069 --> 00:16:01.980
yourself on spikes two maybe three times

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:04.110
per run after that you start to you

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.480
start to put yourself at heavy risk of a

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:10.589
loss alright so we know we're not

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.180
getting HP here which means a good deal

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:18.509
with the devil could put us an empty

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:22.019
vessel state closed Incubus great item

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:25.500
that we do want one orbital ball of

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:27.209
bandages fits the bill completely and

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.970
we'll move along here again Incubus

00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:33.329
great but I totally forgot we had Libra

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:35.130
as well that's like I should be more I

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:37.230
wouldn't say concern necessarily but I

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.560
should be more invested in the concept

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.240
of us having Libra I'm also like trying

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.560
to shoot in the same direction because

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.500
when we shoot in the same direction it's

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:49.470
an all stats upgrade isn't that V it so

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.360
we're going to try to eat something out

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.310
a demon judgement here we got the HP and

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.930
we got the survivability so that's going

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.319
to be an all stats up from synthol

00:16:54.930 --> 00:17:00.480
pretty nice one two and this should be

00:16:58.319 --> 00:17:04.439
an all stats up but it might be a little

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:06.120
downgrade it's it is it was not little

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:09.299
really either it was like it was an all

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.010
stats downgrade but for those of you

00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:13.230
immediately jump into the conclusion

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.600
that that was a bad idea I do want to

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.790
point out it's still piercing shops you

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:22.260
know Libra can't take that away from us

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.939
so there's a mild miss play perhaps but

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.120
to get piercing shots might still be

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:32.190
worth it and a speed downgrade 0.2

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:35.910
damage down pretty nasty actually

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:37.440
but Libra okay my through up there I

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.770
didn't know that a top-down game could

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.320
make me motion sick but that was

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.610
disorienting either way I don't want to

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.230
live on a planet where I don't take

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.570
Libra almost every time it's available

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.340
and you can tell that I believe in that

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.310
message implicitly because I'm doing a

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:58.160
Bernie Sanders finger wag at the camera

00:17:53.310 --> 00:18:05.790
right now we all have the right to Libra

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:07.590
all stats should be equal let's it was

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.360
actually like an okay impromptu

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.730
impression I'm a little surprised bad

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.100
Dodge not at all worried about our HP

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.560
you know why nine lives we got so many

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:22.050
opportunities to come out of this and

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:24.720
that's bookworm it's not bookworm it by

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.220
the way if you're saying hey moron Dead

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.530
Sea Scrolls in the book it's a scroll

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.180
I'm with you 100% but I had thought up

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:35.010
to this point that it operated as a book

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:36.420
for the purposes of the game I don't

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.870
think we're going to get another reroll

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.400
sadly now I was going to say if this is

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.430
small rock we got to think about it

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.820
because I have no oh you jerk I have no

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:50.610
reason or no idea whether small Rock is

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:56.100
a stat upgrade or downgrade in our

00:18:50.610 --> 00:19:00.150
current predicament like it's minus 0.2

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:02.550
speed plus 0.1 damage and minus 1 tears

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:06.870
which is good so it should be in all

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:10.920
sets increase the all state all stats

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:15.290
increase a lot of bad damage there I

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.290
mean if it gives us HP

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:26.970
plus we have empty vessel active now I

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:29.130
don't want that guess we're you know

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.600
what what do we have in our item room I

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:34.020
can't recall Dead Sea Scrolls let me

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:36.300
reroll it into into something else let's

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.920
just get one more charge plus maybe we

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.780
can get enough money to spawn an arcade

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.930
on the next floor it's fairly unlikely

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:47.670
an arcade will be useful but might as

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:48.990
well give it a try could be useful and

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:55.710
we've got a little bit of time

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:57.770
potentially as well so and there's our

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:01.020
boss rush enabler to begin with so

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.250
little okay so I don't know if we're

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.350
gonna do boss rush i don't think it's

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:10.200
compulsory for this run to actually work

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:14.330
but who aura can be so good aura should

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:17.160
always be on all stats up with libra

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.320
because it gives you like a huge

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.210
magnitude of stats up but only for one

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.640
specific category so libra actually

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:26.370
rebalances it and might make this a mild

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.350
all stats increase which is is fairly

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.970
nice you know I think I don't know if we

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.160
have the time but I'm going for it

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.830
nonetheless and this all stats increase

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:41.070
thanks to Libra is going to be on all

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:43.910
stats increase so that was a joke but it

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.910
is going to be that

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.320
our aura has been removed I was like why

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:56.059
did our stats go down that's right our

00:20:51.320 --> 00:21:00.940
aura has been removed and now this run

00:20:56.059 --> 00:21:04.309
is cheap if you break my aura

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:10.429
please don't end the streak

00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:14.419
if you kill my aura yes the classic

00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:14.750
Canadian summer jam steal my sunshine by

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:16.580
Len

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.779
what do you mean Canadian that's right

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.750
we're taking it back you don't have my

00:21:17.779 --> 00:21:24.590
permission anymore the sings steal my

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:27.440
sunshine unless you recognize the band

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:30.590
is Canadian members of it later went on

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.620
to form Broken Social Scene all that

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:35.380
form but be part of perhaps I don't know

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.539
the whole mythos be honest with you

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:44.289
let's go that health upgrade is

00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:44.289
worthwhile whoo

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:54.580
taro cloth is done it look at that dude

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.630
that was dicey and we pulled it back

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.730
mostly thanks for the greatest taro

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.799
cloth I've ever seen in my life plus the

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.539
most opportune spirit arts one could

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:05.149
possibly expect not you don't take that

00:22:02.539 --> 00:22:06.950
you take this it's a step I actually

00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:09.080
thought it was an all stats decrease

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:11.600
thanks to the shots for you downgrade

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:14.000
but by the way why take this well at

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.320
this point like you have a great point

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.850
there's no reason to have taken that

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:21.649
except the hitbox on our tiers is larger

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:27.760
but I took it as kind of a knee-jerk

00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:30.380
reaction so we're not going to go to a

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.770
cloth rush it's literally just in that

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:36.350
second it's gone so luck up it's very

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:38.510
good to be honest with you the health

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.320
upgrade we don't even really want to

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.320
take advantage of

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:49.929
what did you drop there nothing that's a

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:51.970
bummer I stopped you from paying out but

00:22:49.929 --> 00:22:53.710
we would love to use it on a deal with

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.119
the devil so we really should take like

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:58.779
a half red heart at some point in the

00:22:55.119 --> 00:23:06.009
future here there's one back there but I

00:22:58.779 --> 00:23:10.720
don't really want to go back for it come

00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:12.580
on well if we have to pay for this deal

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:18.669
with the devil if we even get one with

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:20.200
spirit hearts life goes on take I mean

00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:21.580
we can no we don't want to re-roll what

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.830
are you talking about take the pole or I

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.200
get down to the next floor and just love

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:30.190
life dude like you're in an extremely

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:32.830
lucky position on this run a couple of I

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:34.330
mean it started a little wonky and then

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.249
it came together quickly with empty

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.429
vessel you're still riding that empty

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:41.679
vessel train you're waiting for guppy

00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:45.399
one day you know a change is going to

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:49.259
come it doesn't seem like it's going to

00:23:45.399 --> 00:23:49.259
be on this run which is very nice for me

00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:57.759
that was a panic reaction and I've never

00:23:54.309 --> 00:24:01.690
been prouder it's like exactly the right

00:23:57.759 --> 00:24:03.190
thing to do there I will say again like

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.710
we've got a really good chance of a deal

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:07.389
with the devil oh you're still alive

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.919
you're just covered by the map we got a

00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:13.029
really good chance for a deal with the

00:24:08.919 --> 00:24:14.590
devil but I don't really want to pay

00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:15.850
spirit hearts for it like paying red

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.169
hearts for it is the right thing but if

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.960
we don't get a deal with the devil and

00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:21.159
we paid we picked up a red hard to try

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.690
to get a deal with the devil that only

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:25.330
cost us red excuse me

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:27.700
red hearts then I lose I lose the

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:30.549
ability to fly at least temporarily so I

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:32.619
mean it's like a pretty minor cost all

00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:35.320
things considered but it is something

00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:37.149
that's it's all my list I'd like to at

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.559
least be at 1/2 of sphere at heart so we

00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:43.869
can take advantage of permanent polaroid

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:46.840
invincibility and we can afford to pay

00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:49.509
spirit hearts just more about whether or

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.669
not I'd you know it's not perfect but

00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:53.779
maybe we should remember the Canadian

00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:56.419
simple planned song of the same name

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:58.129
I'm sorry I can't be perfect I don't

00:24:56.419 --> 00:25:03.409
remember many of the other lyrics it was

00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:08.019
very whiny band so you've lost it all

00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:11.599
nothing lasts forever I'm sorry

00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:14.779
keeping perfect that's all I remember

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:16.340
it might be all the song so yeah we paid

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:18.139
spirit arts where I deal with the devil

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.639
we got sack dagger and we get the key

00:25:18.139 --> 00:25:25.340
permanent polaroid invincibility and

00:25:19.639 --> 00:25:31.099
empty vessels so is it worth it yeah I

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:33.499
mean I think so I got nothing against it

00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:36.529
right now at least canon i entails all

00:25:33.499 --> 00:25:38.210
stats up not a huge all stats up but you

00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:40.249
know with libra you don't really get

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:43.669
that many huge all stats upgrades do you

00:25:40.249 --> 00:25:48.649
it's really like soy milk that's it

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:51.349
I still think libras like maybe the

00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:54.589
worst best item in the game which is

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:56.929
like it's always worth taking in my

00:25:54.589 --> 00:26:00.739
opinion for comedy sake but I don't

00:25:56.929 --> 00:26:03.349
necessarily think it's on average very

00:26:00.739 --> 00:26:09.469
good one of those might be a luck

00:26:03.349 --> 00:26:12.710
upgrade held up lightly oh okay I was

00:26:09.469 --> 00:26:15.409
correct the other ones a health upgrade

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:19.489
which actually is very good it's just

00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:24.139
not very good right now the right way to

00:26:19.489 --> 00:26:27.619
use this I think is if we end up dying

00:26:24.139 --> 00:26:29.659
and are they like we've lost our spirit

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:31.309
hearts but we really for some reason are

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:33.999
committed to making that particular life

00:26:31.309 --> 00:26:37.009
work maybe because it's the last one

00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:39.070
then we we pop this fill it up and then

00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:42.519
we have to HP instead of one but

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:44.450
hopefully this ends up not being

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:46.669
necessary hopefully it ends up not being

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:54.200
relevant but it's nice to have either

00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:57.859
way I got to give like extreme props to

00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:02.029
little brim and Holy Light which really

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:03.070
are keeping this run quite not even just

00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:06.340
like

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:09.370
kind of bad not even just acceptable but

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:13.179
they're keeping this run like actually

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:14.380
quite fun and fairly high damage in

00:27:13.179 --> 00:27:17.139
spite of the fact that our actual

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.029
attributes are decent but not that

00:27:17.139 --> 00:27:20.710
incredible but part of that is also my

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:23.559
bad for not committing hard to be like

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:26.230
at before a build but I like being able

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:30.759
to change my rate of fire or change the

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:32.980
direction of fire I should say at before

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:36.149
was really like a hey our starting rate

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:38.860
of fire is 17 let's take this as like a

00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:42.250
saving grace if things get like truly

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:44.230
horrible I mean I guess you just go with

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:47.080
this and we could we can go with dark

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:50.379
bomb Nell and it might work out for us

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.600
and we don't want the Hermit card yeah

00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:58.929
you know what let's go for it why not

00:27:52.600 --> 00:28:00.610
dude why not still got an empty vessel

00:27:58.929 --> 00:28:01.720
so we're looking at like the permanent

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:05.649
invincibility from that is good I

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:07.960
haven't given up on the guppy dream and

00:28:05.649 --> 00:28:13.659
the invincibility combined with sack

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:15.490
daggers like really really nice we can

00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:20.259
actually okay I believe in that before

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:22.149
it took an extra couple of seconds but

00:28:20.259 --> 00:28:26.679
I've decided that actually at before a

00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:30.279
Libra is amazing because now I have 12

00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:32.289
damaged I've literally doubled I may

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:34.480
have doubled all of my stats actually

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:37.450
our rate of fire is the one that perhaps

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.000
ironically got the least amount of love

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:43.000
from at before ax just funny considering

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.679
that it's also no it didn't give us

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.460
double damage just give us extra damage

00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:50.460
okay grab this still seems great

00:28:51.899 --> 00:29:07.830
we can go to our curse room not going to

00:28:58.349 --> 00:29:13.679
say if not you know mildly scary we're

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:15.239
still still kicking it here oh that

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:23.159
should be a spirit hard or at least a

00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:25.259
payout I should say and it is yeah okay

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:26.879
I would say that that spirit are puts us

00:29:25.259 --> 00:29:29.070
as close as we've ever been to unloose

00:29:26.879 --> 00:29:30.779
Apple territory on this run and the dark

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:34.139
bomb pick up the thing is like the later

00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:35.849
you get it in the game the less likely

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:38.429
it's going to pay for itself but it

00:29:35.849 --> 00:29:38.820
still paid for itself in like under two

00:29:38.429 --> 00:29:41.669
minutes

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:45.679
so you ever find yourself thinking

00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:48.029
poorly of this item you should turn the

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:52.950
the lens of criticism inwards because

00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:55.169
dark bomb if it if you get hit by a

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.779
spider from dark bum that's on you

00:29:55.169 --> 00:30:02.159
that's not dark bombs problem dark bomb

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:03.869
is innocent in all cases all right Isaac

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:07.820
is going down dude we've had like a

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:11.940
selection of very very quick runs today

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:13.499
and it's not really like I've been just

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.509
trying to steamroll them to keep

00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:19.499
production up as fast as possible like

00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:22.469
we've we've done boss rush on some of

00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:25.559
them we backtracked to trying to make

00:30:22.469 --> 00:30:28.799
maximum maximal use of our rerolls like

00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:31.739
we've just been a blessed day of almost

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:33.690
exclusively high octane Isaac runs it's

00:30:31.739 --> 00:30:37.830
a good day to be me and be recording

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:42.509
Isaac okay straight up absolutely rescue

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:45.179
every year old contagions lovely so the

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:46.739
damage downgrade and it's a percentage

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:52.269
damage downgrade that should be booked

00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:54.820
well this does nothing for us really

00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:58.719
I think it's an all step down not it was

00:30:54.820 --> 00:31:02.429
a huge all stats up shows what I know

00:30:58.719 --> 00:31:02.429
anyway we're looking for rerolls their

00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:08.229
host head host host man hat and his

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:10.179
black and white cat I'm all in any other

00:31:08.229 --> 00:31:11.259
Commonwealth countries get postman pat

00:31:10.179 --> 00:31:15.129
when you were a kid we'll talk about

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:17.289
that in the future episode nobody won't

00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:19.209
there's nothing to talk about there was

00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:20.979
a television program called postman pat

00:31:19.209 --> 00:31:24.429
the song of the introduction went

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:26.919
Postman Pat Postman Pat Postman Pat and

00:31:24.429 --> 00:31:28.649
his black and white cat I'm just waiting

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:32.679
for that to be sampled you know like a

00:31:28.649 --> 00:31:34.659
millennial targeted to hip hop Jam you

00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:38.879
call it like postman trap or something

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:38.879
like that so that's a hip-hop word

00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:45.429
probably I don't know what do I know

00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:49.089
on the inside I'm hip-hop but on the

00:31:45.429 --> 00:31:51.789
outside pure indie rock ooh did you see

00:31:49.089 --> 00:31:58.229
the less a beef a concert Lance is too

00:31:51.789 --> 00:32:00.759
savvy fell let's go

00:31:58.229 --> 00:32:03.579
anyway this is yet another easy win

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:05.649
we're fairly quickly approaching a

00:32:03.579 --> 00:32:08.559
double digits well we're like halfway to

00:32:05.649 --> 00:32:14.579
a double digit streak my favorites

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:17.049
Public Enemy album once we get there I

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:19.409
mean we've we've proven ourselves

00:32:17.049 --> 00:32:22.059
there's something you know sports and

00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:24.099
Isaac have a lot of correlation you said

00:32:22.059 --> 00:32:27.779
with a straight face and definitely not

00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:27.779
laughing at all because it's not funny

00:32:28.019 --> 00:32:33.419
teams usually have to pay their dues

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:35.950
before they go on their dynasty winning

00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:37.329
championships right happen to the Oilers

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.919
and the Leafs this year you know they're

00:32:37.329 --> 00:32:41.139
going to pop off a Stanley Cup in the

00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:44.139
next ten years one of those two teams

00:32:41.139 --> 00:32:45.639
probably maybe both happened to the

00:32:44.139 --> 00:32:47.289
Penguins lose to the Red Wings now

00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:51.339
they're going for their you know third

00:32:47.289 --> 00:32:53.559
cup in in ten years this year maybe we

00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:55.149
had to get that nasty streak out of the

00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:56.799
way in the negative direction before we

00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:58.209
could get a beauty streak in the

00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:59.409
positive direction so that's the

00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:00.909
narrative I'm choosing to build right

00:32:59.409 --> 00:33:03.219
now and it's building steam with a grain

00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:04.419
of salt for now thanks for watching hope
